Two months later, the Cardinals reportedly have a roster advantage that could help them considerably as buyers.\n\nSince starting the season 15-24, the Cardinals have ascended up the MLB standings with the third-best record (32-18) in baseball in the last 50 games. Pitching (3.74 ERA) has been very good for St. Louis and the team is performing well despite several key players being on the injured list.\n\nRelated: MLB power rankings Week 15, see where St. Louis Cardinals placed\n\nThe team's turnaround happened in part because of the depth of the Cardinals roster and some young players who stepped up when pressed into bigger roles. Now that St. Louis is back in contention, that depth could make an even bigger difference in trade negotiations.\n\nAs explained by Fox Sports' MLB insider Ken Rosenthal, the Cardinals will be buyers at the MLB trade deadline and they will have an added edge because of their major-league depth.\n\n\"They have major-league pieces to trade and major-league pieces in this market are going to be valuable because with so many teams in contention in this era of the expanded playoffs, teams are not going to want to give up necessarily prospects or make certain kinds of moves.\"\n\nRelated: St. Louis Cardinals game today, Cardinals schedule\n\nAmong the potential Cardinals trade candidates Rosenthal mentioned are catcher Ivan Herrera and outfielder Dylan Carlson. With catcher Willson Contreras in the Cardinals lineup regularly and 25-year-old Pedro Pages emerging as a solid backup option, Herrera becomes expendable.\n\nLikewise, the looming returns of outfielder Lars Nootbar and utility man Tommy Edman could make Carlson expendable. St. Louis also has a little depth on the pitching side, which it could use to package with prospects for upgrades.\n\nAlso Read: Latest MLB trade rumors\n\nPerhaps most importantly for St. Louis, the ability to pair major-league talent with some lower-level prospects means the team could keep its best young talent in the minor leagues. While none of this means the Cardinals will make the biggest move at the MLB trade deadline, the club's depth could result in several trades that will improve the team.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_johnson@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Matt Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Rosenthal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ken Rosenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Carlson_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Carlson (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Edman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Edman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utility player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MLB-St.-Louis-Cardinals-at-Washington-Nationals-23694508.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717734", "eventUri": "eng-9717734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

St. Louis was aggressive against Marsh in the first few innings.\n\nCardinals star Nolan Arenado hit a two-run homer in the second frame. It was his eighth home run of the year as St. Louis took a 2-0 lead.

Marsh threw 101 pitches and registered 16 whiffs, per Baseball Savant.\n\nMarsh now has five quality starts on the season.\n\nThe Royals climbed back from an early three-run deficit in Game 1. In the sixth inning, Perez pulled the team ahead with his 15th home run.\n\nPerez hit a 96.8-mph fastball over the center field wall. The baseball traveled 424 feet as Marsh was given a chance for the victory.\n\nSince June 24, Perez has recorded a hit in 11 of his past 14 games. He has recorded five extra-base hits and 12 RBIs during that span.\n\nPerez finished 2-for-4 in the game. He holds the Royals Interleague record for most home runs (43), RBIs (134) and hits (232).\n\nThe Royals finish their quick two-game set against the Cardinals. Right-hander Michael Wacha will start Game 2 of Wednesday's doubleheader at Busch Stadium.\n\nWacha returns to St. Louis for the first time since departing in 2020. He spent seven seasons with the Cardinals after being selected in the 2012 MLB Draft.\n\nThis season, Wacha is 5-6 with a 3.74 ERA.

At this point in the season, 90 games in, that's the highest percentage for any Cardinals team in the live-ball era (since 1920).\n\nThe Redbirds' close-win percentage has been above 70% only twice this millenium.\n\nCase in point, after a 9-4 win vs. the Giants on June 22, the Cardinals' next eight wins all came by three or fewer runs.

Last season, St. Louis was 9-19 in one-run games at this point.\n\nThe Cardinals, at 48-42, are 10 wins better at this point than last season.\n\nSo that success in one-run games, built with a solid bullpen and clutch play, accounts for a big chunk of the team's improvement.\n\nThis season's .586 win percentage in one-run games at this point is the team's best since 2000 and 20th best in the live-ball era.\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\nIn trying to determine what it portends for the rest of the season, it's tough to find a historical analog to the way this team wins.\n\nTeams with negative run differentials, which the Cardinals have due to their propensity for close wins and losses that sometimes aren't so close, don't make the playoffs often.\n\nColumnist Ben Frederickson dove deeper into that topic, pointing out that the team has been digging out of an early differential hole over the past two months.\n\nFor the season's final 72 games, the pessimistic outlook would be that the Cardinals would lose more of the close games as the bullpen's workload catches up with it.\n\nThe optimistic outlook is that the team could begin to score enough runs to win with ease more often. As the Cardinals regain healthy hitters like Lars Nootbaar and, soon, Tommy Edman, this may be more likely.\n\nWhen examining other Cardinals teams with similar track records to this point where the vast majority of wins were close to this point, none seem like much of a comparison to this year's team.\n\nOnly three other Cardinals teams in the live-ball era recorded more than 76% of their wins by three or fewer runs in their first 90 games. None of them finished above .500. None of them were even above .500 at this point of the season.\n\n1958\n\n90-game record: 45-45\n\nClose-win percentage: 77.78% (35 close wins)\n\nHow did they fare the rest of the way?: These

The club was nine games below .500 and sitting in last place in the NL Central. But since then, the Cardinals have gone 32-18, raising them to second in the division and putting them in firm position for a Wild Card berth.\n\nCan the team continue its hot streak after the All-Star Break? The team will have to improve its offense, which is 20th in MLB in runs scored per game, and its pitching staff that is 22nd in runs allowed per contest. With the MLB trade deadline less than a month away, St. Louis still has ample opportunities to add players who can improve the club's postseason odds. Here are four Cardinals players who must be on the trade block ahead of the 2024 MLB deadline.\n\nJimmy Crooks (Catcher)\n\nAfter nearly two decades of Yadier Molina starting behind the dish, the St. Louis Cardinals have smoothly transitioned to their next generation of catchers. Willson Contreras, signed from the Chicago Cubs in 2023, is a three-time All-Star under contract through the 2028 season. The club also has youngster Ivan Herrera. The 25-year-old is under team control through 2026 and has a .718 OPS this year while ranking in the 81st percentile amongst MLB backstops in blocks above average.\n\nWith this talented duo behind the plate, there is very little path for playing time for catchers in the Cardinals' farm system. Jimmy Crooks is playing well for the franchise at Double-A Springfield, batting .312 on the year and gaining praise from scouts for his defensive work. He will be a potential starter one day and should carry decent value in the trade market.\n\nTink Hence (Pitcher)\n\nWith shortstop Masyn Winn graduating to the Big Leagues, right-hander Tink Hence is now the top prospect in the Cardinals' system. Hence has great stuff, particularly a strong fastball and a dominant changeup, but he is still learning to use it consistently. The 21-year-old had a 5.47 ERA in 54.1 Double-A innings last year as opponents slugged .613 off his slider. If his slider fails to miss bats, Hence could find himself as a two-pitch reliever\n\nThe youngster has been much better at Double-A this year, posting a 3.29 ERA in 54.2 IP with an impressive 12.0 strikeouts per nine innings after his promotion from Single-A. Yet there are still concerns about his durability. Hence pitched just eight innings in 2021, 52 frames in 2022, and 96 innings last year.\n\nTink Hence is an electric arm, but his ceiling will be severely capped if he does not develop his pitches outside the fastball and changeup or continues to spend significant amounts of time on the IL. With two other arms among St. Louis' top five prospects, the Cardinals can afford to part with one of their young hurlers.\n\nTravis Honeyman (Outfielder)\n\nAs in the catching department, the Cardinals also have a wealth of organizational outfield depth. Top prospects Jordan Walker and Victor Scott II -- both of whom made MLB All-Star Futures Game appearances -- are on the 40-man roster but find themselves at Triple-A thanks to early-season struggles. Both players have yet to turn 24, so there is no reason they cannot turn things around soon.\n\nAs long as Scott and Walker are on the club, the path for other minor league outfielders in the St. Louis system to reach the Majors is difficult. Travis Honeyman is a contact-heavy outfielder out of Boston College who rarely strikes out but does not offer much power. The 22-year-old could move this summer as the Cardinals push for a playoff berth.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_hanley@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Liam Hanley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadier_Molina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yadier Molina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Farm team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston College"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/X-Cardinals-who-must-be-on-trade-block-ahead-of-2024-deadline.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717734", "eventUri": "eng-9717734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He allowed one run on four hits.\n\nThe Royals will send out righty Alec Marsh (6-6, 4.57) for the early game.\n\nHis ERA has jumped up a run after two of his last four starts lasted just three innings.

The early portion of his schedule sets him to start at DH and center field as he builds into games. Edman faced teammate Riley O'Brien during a live batting practice session Saturday in Springfield, Missouri. Edman has not appeared in a game since offseason wrist surgery. Updated July 8\n\nIvan Herrera (lower back tightness): Will move from designated hitter to catching during his rehab assignment with Class AAA Memphis. He homered in his first game of the current rehab assignment, and he has had no ongoing soreness or limitations due to the back pain first felt on the team's trip to Birmingham, Alabama. For more on Herrera's goals during his rehab assignment please see the note in Cardinals Extra about him. Updated July 7\n\nRiley O'Brien (flexor tendon): Cardinals have declined to offer details on O'Brien's schedule following an live batting practice outing this past weekend. He could do that again, start a rehab assignment, or see another slow down of his progress, pending how he feels in the early days of this week. The Cardinals have declined to disclose much about his recovery from the live BP, saying only that it went well. O'Brien was slated to pitch for Double-A Springfield on June 18, however he had trouble bouncing back from his last outing. O'Brien was sent for an MRI, which came back clean. Updated July 8\n\nSteven Matz (lower back stiffness): Matz continues to play catch back in St. Louis after receiving clearance to being throwing on Thursday after suffering a setback in his rehab process that prevented him from throwing for two weeks. He is still several weeks away from any conversation about a rehab assignment and starts in minor-league games. He experienced lingering soreness the morning following a June rehab outing, leading to a lengthy setback. Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said the best-case scenario is a four-to-six week recovery time for Matz.

The series opener was postponed Tuesday and will be played as Game 1 of the doubleheader on Wednesday. Below we will continue our MLB odds series with a Royals-Cardinals prediction and pick.\n\nLast Start: vs. Tampa Bay Rays: Win, 6 innings, 2 hits, one run, 3 walks, 8 strikeouts\n\n2024 Road Splits: 8 starts, 3.94 ERA, 1.14 WHIP, 45.2 innings pitched, 41K/14BB, .224 oBA\n\nAndre Pallante (4-3) with a 4.00 ERA, 1.44 WHIP, 45 innings pitched, 36K/19BB, .267 oBA\n\nLast Start: at Pittsburgh Pirates: No Decision, 7 innings, 4 hits, 1 run, 1 walk, 5 strikeouts\n\n2024 Home Splits: 7 games, 3 starts, 4.12 ERA, 1.63 WHIP, 19.2 innings pitched, 16K/10BB, .286 oBA\n\nTV: Bally Sports Kansas City, Bally Sports Midwest\n\nThe Royals have been a very good team this season. They are throwing, and hitting the ball well. Offensively, the Royals have to be at the top of their game to win this one. Kansas City is 11th in barrel percentage, 10th in hard hit percentage, fifth in average exit velocity, ninth in doubles, and 12th in runs scored. The Royals need to continue hitting the ball well if they want to win this game.\n\nMichael Wacha is on the mound for this one, and he is having a very respectable season. He has a great chance to have another good game Tuesday night. The Cardinals are bottom-10 in the MLB in barrel percentage, hard hit percentage, average exit velocity, home runs, and Slugging percentage. St. Louis does not hit the ball well, and the Royals should be able to take advantage of that.\n\nWhy The Cardinals Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nPallante has been a little better as a starter this season. His strikeout rate is about 11 percent higher as a starter, and his opponent's batting average is much lower. Along with that, his ERA as a starter this season is 3.34. He has pitched well since moving into the starting rotation, and that should continue in this game. If Pallante can carry his momentum into this game, the Cardinals will win this game.\n\nThe Cardinals will have to find a way to hit the ball well in this game. As mentioned, they have struggled all season, but they are coming off a good weekend, and they have been hitting well in their last 10 games. In those games, St. Louis is batting .264 with a .721 OPS, and 46 runs scored. The Cardinals should be able to keep that momentum going in this game. If they can do that, the Cardinals will win this game.\n\nFinal Royals-Cardinals Game 1 Prediction & Pick\n\nWith how both teams are playing at the moment, this should be a good game and a good series. The Royals are the better team on paper, but the Cardinals are playing well lately. As mentioned, Pallante is throwing well as a starter, and Wacha has been great in his return to the mound. I am going to take the Royals to win this game. Wacha has the hot hand, and I think it will continue here.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Pallante", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andre Pallante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wacha", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Wacha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_Midwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports Midwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_against", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average against"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Royals-vs.-Cardinals-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717734", "eventUri": "eng-9717734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Game 1 comes at 1:45 p.m. ET in St. Louis. Kansas City is third in the AL Central with a 49-43 mark, but it is trying to regain some momentum after losing three of its last four, including two of three at Colorado. The Cardinals are second in the AL central at 48-42. With both teams battling for wild-card positioning in their respective leagues, Wednesday's interleague twin bill looms large. The projected starters for Game 1 are Alec Marsh (6-6, 4.57 ERA) for K.C. and Andre Pallante (4-3, 4.00 ERA) for St. Louis.\n\nThe latest Cardinals vs. Royals odds via SportsLine consensus list St. Louis as the -131 favorite (risk $131 to win $100) on the money line. The over/under is 8.5. Before making any Royals vs. Cardinals picks, be sure to check out the MLB predictions and betting advice from SportsLine's proven computer model.\n\nThe SportsLine Projection Model simulates every MLB game 10,000 times. It entered Week 16 of the 2024 MLB season a profitable 49-37 on all-top rated MLB picks this season. Dating back to last season, it is on a 24-9 roll on top-rated run-line picks (+1077). Anybody following has seen strong returns.\n\nNow, the model has set its sights on Royals vs. Cardinals and just locked in its picks and MLB predictions. You can head to SportsLine now to see the model's picks. Now, here are several MLB odds and betting lines for Cardinals vs. Royals:\n\nCardinals vs. Royals money line: Cardinals -131, Royals +111Cardinals vs. Royals run line: Cardinals -1.5 (+156) Cardinals vs. Royals over/under: 8.5 runsCardinals vs. Royals picks: See picks at SportsLineTop Cardinals vs. Royals pick\n\nFor Royals vs. Cardinals, one of the top picks from SportsLine's model is that Royals shortstop Bobby Witt goes Over 1.5 total bases (-128). The model is projecting 2.3 total bases for the young star.\n\nThe 24-year-old righty is absolutely mashing this season. He has a .324 batting average with a .564 slugging percentage and an OPS of .936. His 25 doubles, nine triples and 15 home runs are all pacing to be career highs. Those are all notable marks in this situation since one extra-base hit would make this prop hit.\n\nAnd though Witt hits both lefties and righties well, his power numbers are slightly better against righties, which is what he's scheduled to see in Pallante in Game 1 on Wednesday. See more picks at SportsLine.\n\nHow to make Cardinals vs. Royals picks\n\nIn addition to that prop pick, the model also says one side of the money line has all the value. You can only get the MLB model's picks and analysis at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins Royals vs. Cardinals, and which side of the money line has all the value?

After sinking to 15-24 with a seven-game losing streak in May, the Cardinals have gone 33-18.\n\n\"We're not close to being done,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said after his team blanked the Washington Nationals 6-0 on Monday to reach six games over .500 for the first time this season. \"I told you they were convicted in what the goal was leaving spring. We're taking it one game at a time, but they're doing a nice job.\"\n\nThe Cardinals got a boost Monday when outfielder Lars Nootbaar returned from his injury, a left oblique strain.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can finish this first half strong, go into the break and then have some success in the second half,\" Nootbaar said. \"I want to keep the guys rolling.\"\n\nThe Cardinals will start Andre Pallante (4-3, 4.00 ERA) in Game 1 with the Game 2 starter to be determined. Sonny Gray (9-5, 3.30) was set to start Game 2 but has been pushed to start Friday's series opener against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nPallante is 4-2 with a 3.34 ERA in his seven starts. The right-hander limited the Pirates to one run on four hits at Pittsburgh in his last start Thursday while striking out five and walking one.\n\nIn his only previous career outing against the Royals, Pallante allowed three runs (two earned) on three hits in a two-inning relief stint on Aug. 11, 2023.\n\nThe Royals are coming off a 10-1 victory at Colorado on Sunday. Prior to that win, they lost nine of their previous 15 games.\n\nKansas City will start right-handers Alec Marsh (6-6, 4.57) in Game 1 and Michael Wacha (5-6, 3.74) in Game 2.\n\nMarsh will be seeking to rebound from a 10-8 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays on Thursday. He allowed five runs on six hits and three walks in three innings while facing just 17 batters, his fewest since April 24.\n\nThis will be his first career appearance against the Cardinals.\n\nWacha, who pitched for the Cardinals from 2013-19, held opponents to three runs on 12 hits while striking out 19 batters in 16 1/3 innings in his last three starts.\n\nHe earned a 4-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays in his last outing on July 3 while allowing just one run on two hits and three walks in his six innings.\n\n\"He gives up a homer in the first and you look up later and (he allowed) one run in six innings,\" Royals manager Matt Quatraro said. \"For a veteran that's had a lot of success in the big leagues to still try to adapt to what the opposing hitters are doing is really impressive. And I think that is a good example to set for the younger guys as well.\"\n\nThis will be Wacha's third career start against his initial team. He is 2-0 with 2.19 ERA against St. Louis.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@islandpacket.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Marmol", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Marmol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Busch Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Pallante", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Pallante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Nootbaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lars Nootbaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonny Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wacha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Wacha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Quatraro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Quatraro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/qgyqo9/picture288912916/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/3db00ffb-eb31-4768-a133-cec997b320ee", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717734", "eventUri": "eng-9717734", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-24", "textStart": 2108, "textEnd": 2116}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 2420, "textEnd": 2426}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-08-", "textStart": 1655, "textEnd": 1662}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

It's the first time since 2017 the Royals have a record as good as or better than the Cardinals heading into the series. St. Louis has certainly had the upper hand in the overall series, going 75-49, but the Royals won the four out of seven that actually mattered in 1985.\n\nTonight's game has already been postponed due to rain all day in St. Louis, and the teams will have a split doubleheader on Wednesday.\n\nKansas City Royals (49-43) vs. St. Louis Cardinals (48-42) at Busch Stadium, St. Louis, MO\n\nRoyals: 4.54 runs scored/game (13th in MLB), 3.93 runs allowed/game (6th)\n\nCardinals: 4.10 runs scored/game (22nd), 4.47 runs allowed/game (20th)\n\nThe Cardinals got off to a very slow 15-24 start, but since then have won 33 of 51 - the best record in the National League over that time - to climb back into contention. They are 24-18 at home in front of the \"Best Fans in Baseball\" and are coming off a successful 6-2 road trip against the Pirates and Nationals.\n\nOnly five teams have hit fewer home runs than the Cardinals, but they're not exactly playing \"Whiteyball\" either, with just 55 steals in 70 attempts and lack a real identity. Catcher Willson Contreras got off to a terrific start, but missed six weeks with a fractured forearm, and hasn't quite been the same since.\n\nAll-Stars Paul Goldschmidt and Nolan Arenado are not once they once were with Goldschmidt posting the highest strikeout rate of his career and Arenado posting the lowest ISO of his. Goldschmidt has really struggled at home, batting .195/.247/.340 at Busch Stadium. Brendan Donovan has been a hot hitter, batting .349/.407/.518 over his last 21 games.\n\nRookie shortstop Masyn Winn has been phenomenal defensively, leading the league at that position in Defensive Runs Saved at +11. Centerfielder Michael Siani is second among all players with 11 Outs Above Average. Otherwise, the Cardinals are average-to-poor defensively.\n\nMichael Wacha was originally drafted by the Cardinals and won 59 games for them over seven seasons. He'll face right-hander Andre Pallante, a reliever who has transitioned to starting recently, pitching a season-high seven innings in his last out against the Pirates, allowing just one run. He throws a four-seamer, sinker, slider, and a knuckle curve with a 39.5 percent whiff rate. Righties have strangely fared much better against him, hitting .337/.427/.506 compared to .202/.268/.247 for lefties.\n\nLongtime veteran and 2023 All-Star Sonny Gray has a career 9-2 record with a 1.76 ERA in 13 starts against the Royals. He has given up 11 runs in 9 / innings over his last two outings and a 4.48 ERA over his last 11 starts. The 34-year-old throws a 92 mph fastball that gets hit pretty well, combined with an effective sweeper and cutter, a sinker, and a curveball. Opponents hit it on the ground 46.5 percent of the time against him.\n\nThe Cardinals have the fifth-best bullpen by ERA at 3.40 despite the seventh-lowest strikeout rate. They have the seventh-lowest walk rate and the second-highest ground ball rate among bullpens. Closer Ryan Helsley leads the majors with 31 saves, and when he blew the lead in his last outing on July 5, it was just his second blown save of the year. JoJo Romero and Matthew Liberatore feature some of the best sliders in baseball. John King has a 61.5 percent groundball rate, sixth-highest in baseball. Lefties are hitting just .170/.235/.170 against lefty JoJo Romero, while lefty John King does not have a platoon split.\n\nThe Cardinals are going through a bit of an identity crisis, coming off a 91-loss season and some calls from fans for manager Oli Marmol to be fired. But they have righted the ship recently and still have a talented roster of homegrown talent. The Royals can stand toe-to-toe with their cross-state rivals, but can they take a short two-game series from them?", "source": {"uri": "royalsreview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Royals

The early portion of his schedule sets him to start at DH and center field as he builds into games. Edman faced teammate Riley O'Brien during a live batting practice session Saturday in Springfield, Missouri. Edman has not appeared in a game since offseason wrist surgery. Updated July 8\n\nIvan Herrera (lower back tightness): Will move from designated hitter to catching during his rehab assignment with Class AAA Memphis. He homered in his first game of the current rehab assignment, and he has had no ongoing soreness or limitations due to the back pain first felt on the team's trip to Birmingham, Alabama. For more on Herrera's goals during his rehab assignment please see the note in Cardinals Extra about him. Updated July 7\n\nRiley O'Brien (flexor tendon): Cardinals have declined to offer details on O'Brien's schedule following an live batting practice outing this past weekend. He could do that again, start a rehab assignment, or see another slow down of his progress, pending how he feels in the early days of this week. The Cardinals have declined to disclose much about his recovery from the live BP, saying only that it went well. O'Brien was slated to pitch for Double-A Springfield on June 18, however he had trouble bouncing back from his last outing. O'Brien was sent for an MRI, which came back clean. Updated July 8\n\nSteven Matz (lower back stiffness): Matz continues to play catch back in St. Louis after receiving clearance to being throwing on Thursday after suffering a setback in his rehab process that prevented him from throwing for two weeks. He is still several weeks away from any conversation about a rehab assignment and starts in minor-league games. He experienced lingering soreness the morning following a June rehab outing, leading to a lengthy setback. Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said the best-case scenario is a four-to-six week recovery time for Matz.

The first pitch for the opener will be at 12:45 p.m., and the nightcap will begin at the originally scheduled time of 6:45 p.m.\n\nThe Royals' Michael Wacha (5-6, 3.74 ERA) is scheduled to face Andre Pallante (4-3, 4.00) of the Cardinals in Game 1, though pitching plans could change because of the postponement. Alec Marsh (6-6, 4.57) is the scheduled starter for Kansas City in Game 2 against Sonny Gray (9-5, 3.30) for St. Louis.\n\nTuesday's forecast called for rain lasting throughout the day and localized flooding.

Both players are headed to the All-Star Game, along with outstanding starting pitchers Cole Ragans and Seth Lugo.\n\nRoyals manager Matt Quatraro was thrilled to salute those four for their All-Star selection during a team meeting Sunday.\n\n\"It was really cool,\" Quatraro told reporters. \"Truthfully, I get pretty emotional doing that.

Fans poured back into Kauffman Stadium while franchise owner John Sherman continued his push for a new ballpark - perhaps on the Kansas side of the border, after the franchise failed to muster public support for a move downtown.\n\nAlas, our friends from Missouri's West Coast suffered a 6-9 downturn midway through the season. So there is more work to do.\n\nOver at FanGraphs, Jake Mailhot noted Kansas City's slippage:\n\nThe Royals lost both of their series last week and are now a game and a half back in the AL Wild Card race. They've got a huge series in Boston this weekend that could shape the course of the rest of their season. They've indicated they're willing to buy at the deadline to help bolster their surprising run this year, but they've got plenty of players who would be enticing for other teams should they want to improve their long-term outlook. This final week before the All-Star break could push them one way or the other.\n\nThe Royals come into Busch Stadium on the heels of their refreshing 10-1 victory at Colorado Sunday. But they could use more offense, so they are one of the teams to watch ahead of the trade deadline.\n\nWriting for ESPN, Jeff Passan noted that the Royals front office must feel urgency to make something of this long-awaited breakout.\n\nNo longer do the Royals hold one of the six AL playoff spots, and after at one point being 15 games over .500, they sport a 49-43 record and trail Boston by 1\u00bd games for the final AL wild-card slot. The question for (GM J.J.) Picollo, then, is not whether the Royals are looking for upgrades -- they are -- but just how much talent they're willing to cede in an effort to make this postseason.\n\nKansas City's aggressiveness in the winter has paid off handsomely. Snapping up All-Star Seth Lugo on a three-year, $45 million deal was one of the coups of the offseason. Michael Wacha has been very good, too. The stability of Kansas City's rotation has offset a bullpen with the 25th-ranked ERA and an offense held back by an outfield group whose collective OPS, over 1,017 plate appearances, is .624, better than only the White Sox's.\n\nBecause the Royals operate on a relatively low budget, the balance between free agents and homegrown players dictates that they can't afford to deplete prospect capital via trades, which limits their options. A mediocre farm system doesn't help matters. Kansas City last made the postseason when it won the World Series in 2015, and Picollo reaching October in his second full season as GM would be a huge win.\n\nThe Royals aren't going to be in the (Garrett) Crochet or (Luis) Robert sweepstakes. They don't need to be. There are enough relievers available for Kansas City to elevate its leverage options. And seeing as they've booked nearly 1,000 plate appearances of negative production from outfielders, just about anything is an upgrade from what they have.\n\nThe Cardinals will have a glut of outfielders if Tommy Edman is able to resume his career, so maybe these teams should talk.\n\nTALKIN' BASEBALL\n\nHere is what folks have been writing about Our National Pastime:\n\nKen Rosenthal, The Athletic: \"(Cardinals president of baseball operations John) Mozeliak downplayed the urgency to add another starter, citing, in part, the presences of Gordon Graceffo and Michael McGreevy at Triple A . . . OK, but Mozeliak should have flexibility to maneuver. (Ivan) Herrera could be expendable with the emergence of Pedro Pages. Ditto for Dylan Carlson with the returns of (Lars) Nootbaar and Edman. And other combinations of players could be offered as well. The Cardinals entered Sunday ranked 24th in runs per game. They had played 29 one-run games, tied for second in the majors behind the Cubs' 33. And their offensive problems threaten to unravel their pitching. Breaking more games open would help preserve the bullpen. So could the addition of another starter.\"\n\nR.J. Anderson, CBSSports.com: \"It's easy to forget that Chicago's decision to put Crochet in their rotation this spring was met with skepticism; not because he lacked talent, but because he lacked precedent. He came into the year having thrown just 73 big-league innings since being drafted in 2020 because of various injuries. Though he's more than doubled that figure during the interim period, the question remains: how much can you rely on him the rest of the way -- this season, and from now until his winter 2026 date with free agency? No one can say for sure, leading to a wider than normal range of potential outcomes and returns. There's no reason to doubt a healthy Crochet's ability; he's introduced a cutter that works as a bridge pitch between his fastball and slider, giving him the kind of interplay that has transformed him into an above-average starter. All the stars in the sky will eventually burn out; Crochet will too. But first, if the heavens allow, the probable best starter moved this deadline could help determine who wins a pennant this October.\"\n\nBob Nightengale, USA Today: \"GMs are skeptical whether any team will meet their high price-tag for oft-injured center fielder Luis Robert Jr., of the White Sox, but believe the market will be robust for starter Erick Fedde (6-3, 3.13 ERA). The Cubs are telling teams they still remain undecided whether they will be sellers at the trade deadline, but are preparing for a potential sale, with Bellinger, Jameson Taillon and Nico Hoerner expected to draw interest. It's hard to believe how things went south on the Northside after their 17-9 start. Miami Marlins lefty Jesus Luzardo is on the injured list until at least Aug. 18 with a lumbar stress reaction (back), but it hasn't stopped teams from inquiring about his availability, believing he'd still make an impact in the pennant stretch and postseason.\"\n\nBen Verlander, FoxSports.com: \"The Red Sox are making it hard to justify not buying at the trade deadline. They've been one of baseball's best teams since the start of June, winning 16 of their past 22 and taking two of three from the Yankees in The Bronx over the weekend. They snatched a victory from the jaws of defeat Friday before Rafael Devers hit two more home runs in a 3-0 win Sunday. Devers is hitting .316 with a 1.079 OPS and 11 homers in his past 30 games, helping him get an All-Star nod alongside teammates Tanner Houck and Jarren Duran.\"\n\nMEGAPHONE\n\n\"Obviously, I pay attention to it. I see it. I hear it all the time. But I've still got to perform. A wise person told me, 'Every time you take the mound, you're playing for every team in the league. That's just the fact of the matter. You never know what can happen in this business. What I try and focus on is playing for my teammates and playing the game hard.\"\n\nWhite Sox pitcher Garrett Crochet, on being a popular trade target.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri":

Then, he pitched a masterpiece in the NLDS. Then, he won the MVP award of the NLCS. The Cardinals advanced to the World Series ... their most-recent World Series.\n\nWacha now is 33. He's with Kansas City, his sixth team. He's still firing and faring well -- his ERA is 3.74. And on Tuesday night, weather permitting (a significant amount of rain from the remnants of Hurricane Beryl is forecast for most of the day and evening) he'll have a career-first -- a start at Busch Stadium against the Cardinals.\n\nBet there might be an ovation.\n\nBut Wacha's return is a reminder of a seemingly bygone era, back when the Cardinals developed homegrown starters and won playoff rounds.\n\nPi Pizzeria closing last remaining location, in St. Louis' Central West End McClellan: Downtown St. Louis is a casualty of the do-gooder war Hulk Hogan starts selling his new Real American Beer in Missouri, competing with Bud Light BenFred: Why Jordan Walker's name will provide hot-stove fodder as Cardinals near trade deadline Parades, fireworks and parties: Your guide to July 4th in St. Louis Wentzville schools investigated board members for alleged retaliation, ethics violations Tropical Storm Beryl could hit St. Louis area with 4 inches of rain or more Several St. Louis-area cities move fireworks shows to Friday.

From 2011-2014, its Cardinals made it to the NLCS all four times and the World Series twice.\n\nSo many homegrown arms. First-rounders Wacha, Lance Lynn and Shelby Miller, as well as draft and international finds such as Carlos Martinez, Jason Motte, Trevor Rosenthal, Jaime Garcia, Kevin Siegrist, Seth Maness and more.\n\nPerhaps that era stands out not only because of the ERAs, but also because of the stark contrast to recent years.\n\nHate to bring this up, but in the 2014 NLCS manager Mike Matheny went to a cold Wacha to pitch out of the 'pen. The season was on the line. Wacha, who was returning from injury, hadn't pitched since Sept. 26. And, yep, Wacha allowed a pennant-winning walk-off homer to Travis Ishikawa.\n\nWell, since that game, the Cardinals have only won one playoff series (a 2019 NLDS). And because they were swept in the 2019 NLCS, the last NLCS game they have won was Game 2 of the 2014 series.\n\nThe current rotation has two homegrown arms, but both come with asterisks. The first is Lynn, who left St. Louis in 2018, returning this year. And the other is Andre Pallante, who wasn't supposed to even be in the rotation. He has fared well in most of his seven starts (he's set to oppose Wacha on Tuesday), but it's fair to be wary about how long this can last.\n\nAnd the Cardinals don't have much in Memphis.\n\nSo, the most-recent first-round drafted pitcher is Cooper Hjerpe from 2022. He's pitching well in Class AA. But before him, check out this list of first-round pitchers: Michael McGreevy (2021), Zack Thompson (2019), Dakota Hudson (2016) and Jake Woodford (2015).\n\nNow, perhaps you've heard, the 2024 Cardinals are making quite a remarkable push. On May 11, they were nine games under .500. The Cards now are 48-42 and just finding ways to win. It's fair to point out their recent series wins were against sub-.500 teams Washington, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. But, hey, you can't control your schedule.\n\nAs I mentioned in Monday's column, the Cardinals profile as a playoff team (with the third wild-card slot a welcoming possibility). On the road to possible return to the good ol' days is Wacha, a main character from those seasons. He's faced the Cardinals twice before, but never in St. Louis. This is a big one.\n\nAnd give Wacha credit for diligent work to a career rejuvenation. After leaving the Cards, he battled injuries and bad years -- notably 2020 with the Mets and 2021 with the Rays (5.05 ERA in 29 games, 23 starts). Looked dire, didn't it? But Wacha logged a 3.32 ERA for Boston in 2022 and a 3.22 ERA for San Diego in 2023.\n\nAnd this year, he's in the \"threes\" yet again. Now, in the last couple years, he's thrown his changeup even more than ever before. This year, it's particularly wicked. He throws it 31.9% of the time (his four-seamer is second-most thrown, at 24%) and opponents hit just .196 against it.\n\nEarlier in 2024, Wacha was hit a bit. But beginning on May 9, he's tallied a 2.31 in his past eight starts. And the Royals actually are ... good. They have a quartet of All-Stars and a record similar to the Cardinals, at 49-43. Wacha sure seems like he might notch yet another win on the Busch mound.\n\nReally, the Royal always is connected to St. Louis. He's part of team history. He married a St. Louis girl. He's close with some members of the Cardinals' family. On Tuesday, he'll see familiar faces Lynn, Matt Carpenter and Cards bench coach Daniel Descalso.\n\nAnd even though Wacha started 151 games wearing the birds on the bat (59-39, 3.91) he's always remembered for that run in 2023, when he was 22 -- with the world in his pitching hand and the World Series on the horizon.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news",

History suggests it matters.", "body": "Ben Frederickson\n\nSome overvalue it. Others might be too quick to dismiss it. We're talking about run differential, because the Cardinals have one worth talking about.\n\nRun differential, the obvious opposite of extremely advanced baseball statistics, tracks the most simple number. Runs scored minus runs allowed. Do the math, and you learn something about a club.\n\nWell, maybe.\n\nGood teams tend to score more than they are scored upon. Bad teams tend to do the opposite of that. Occasionally there are outliers. Are the Cardinals one of them?\n\nFollowing Monday's road win against the Nationals, the Cardinals remained second in the National League Central Division. They would be a non-sweating recipient of one of the NL's three wild-card playoff spots if the season ended today; thank you very much, MLB's expanded postseason.\n\nPi Pizzeria closing last remaining location, in St. Louis' Central West End McClellan: Downtown St. Louis is a casualty of the do-gooder war Hulk Hogan starts selling his new Real American Beer in Missouri, competing with Bud Light BenFred: Why Jordan Walker's name will provide hot-stove fodder as Cardinals near trade deadline Parades, fireworks and parties: Your guide to July 4th in St. Louis Wentzville schools investigated board members for alleged retaliation, ethics violations Tropical Storm Beryl could hit St. Louis area with 4 inches of rain or more Several St. Louis-area cities move fireworks shows to Friday.

Extra! Read all about Cardinals' comeback from 5-run deficit to outlast Nats in 11th Messenger: Judge fines St. Louis attorney for hiding documents on police shootings\n\nThe Cardinals also happen to own one of the worst run differentials in the NL.\n\nThe crushed Colorado Rockies woke up Monday with a 32-58 record and the NL's worst run differential. They had allowed 149 more runs than they had scored. The mangled Miami Marlins are 32-58 with the NL's second-worst run differential. Minus-134\n\nThird-worst?\n\nIt's the climbing Cardinals, the NL's winningest team since Mother's Day, checking in at minus-33.\n\nThe Phillies were at plus-109 on Monday. The Dodgers, plus-104. The NL Central leading Brewers were plus-79. The Braves, plus-59, and probably disappointed about it. The Mets, Padres, Diamondbacks and even the Reds are in the run-differential green zone. The Cardinals remain in the red.\n\nSo, what does it mean?\n\nMaybe something. Maybe nothing. Let's see.\n\nThe Cardinals lose in lopsided fashion often enough to affect the numbers. Six times, they have won a game by five or more runs. Fourteen times they have lost a game by that same margin. The good news? A blowout loss still counts as just one loss.\n\nAfter that, we will need to see more.\n\nGood teams with bad run differentials do exist. They're just rare. And they usually have defining characteristics that help defy the norm. They have great bullpens, or remarkable home-field advantages, or incredible success in tight games, or some combination of all of the above.\n\nIt's pretty hard to become an outlier, though.\n\nOnly 11 teams have made the postseason with negative run differentials. Toss out seasons shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic or work stoppages, and that number shrinks to just seven. Of those seven, only four were 20 or more runs on run differential's wrong side: the 2023 Marlins, the 2007 Diamondbacks, the 2005 Padres and the 1987 Twins.\n\nPostseason expansion will make it easier. It's already happened. Last season became the first in which two teams with a negative run differential made the same playoff picture.\n\nSkip Schumaker's Marlins were an unprecedented minus-52 as a wild-card recipient in 2023. They were promptly swept out of the playoffs. But the Diamondbacks in the same bracket managed to go from a minus-15 run differential in the regular season to playing in the World Series. Had Arizona beaten the Rangers, the deniers of run differential's relevance would have had their best example since the 1987 Twins (minus-20) beat the Cardinals to win it all. Instead the Rangers (plus-165) rolled, continuing a popular theme of one of the season's run differential darlings becoming champs.\n\nI'm sorry for bringing up that 1987 World Series, but it remains the only example of a negative run differential-owning team securing a ring. That Twins team had home-field advantage as its legitimate superpower. Before it won every single home World Series game, it went 56-25 in the Metrodome (with a plus-63 run differential there) in regular season home games. Like I said earlier, you have to have a thing (or things) to defy run differential's gravitational pull.\n\nMaybe the Cardinals have a thing, or things.\n\nThey do tend to win close games, which has done a lot more for their winning record than their run differential. They are an impressive 17-12 in one-run decisions. Cap tip to manager Oli Marmol for that one.\n\nThe Cardinals also tend to stop any bleeding before it gets too bad. Especially lately. They haven't lost three consecutive games since their Mother's Day awakening in Milwaukee stabilized what had become a season-worst seven-game slide. Even when one of those too-often blowout losses occurs, the Cardinals are quick to rebound.\n\nThey also have an All-Star closer in Ryan Helsley, who leads baseball in saves, and a bullpen that leads the NL in holds. Good signs.\n\nThis last sign could be the best one, though. The Cardinals' still-concerning run differential is slowly but surely improving. The last-place Cardinals had a minus-52 anchor around them on May 11. Since then, including Monday's blowout win of the Nationals, it's been a plus-19.\n\nInstead of trying to become the next run differential exception, it's better to win your way out of the danger zone.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_frederickson@stltoday.com", "name": "Ben Frederickson",

Will they be buyers or sellers? The organization is currently sitting at 47-42 on the year, which is good enough for second place in the National League Central.\n\nDespite an average offense and struggling rotation, the Cardinals remain in the NL Wild Card race. On top of that, three important players are on the verge of returning from injuries in Lars Nootbar, Tommy Edman, and Ivan Herrera. The production St. Louis gets out of these three will play a part in what direction they will go on July 30th.\n\nVia Ken Rosenthal:\n\n\"Outfielder Lars Nootbaar is expected back next week, catcher Ivan Herrerabefore the All-Star break. Center fielder Tommy Edman, out all season recovering from right wrist surgery, is on track to return after the break.\"\n\n\"The big thing for the Cardinals is, will we score enough runs?\" president of baseball operations John Mozeliak said. \"Getting Nootbaar and Edman back could change that calculus. We'll see.\"\n\nPerhaps the biggest offensive issue for the Cardinals is the struggles of veterans Nolan Arenado and Paul Goldschmidt. While Arenado is slashing .270, he has just seven homers. As for Goldy, he's batting .226 with 11 bombs. Not good enough from either star. On top of that, Jordan Walker, who showed promise last season, is down in Triple-A and showing no signs of turning things around.\n\nCardinals need to pick direction\n\nSt. Louis ranks 19th in the big leagues in runs scored with only 4.1 per game. They're also just 16th in average, 18th in OBP, and 19th in slugging. The Cardinals have only slugged 84 home runs, too.\n\nAs for pitching, this is an old rotation. While the staff as a whole owns a 3.95 ERA, the starters aren't the most consistent. Sonny Gray and Kyle Gibson have ERAs under four, while Miles Mikolas and Lance Lynn have been disappointing. Andre Pallante has been a breath of fresh air though, while Steven Matz could be back in August. He was terrible before going on the shelf, posting a 6.18 ERA in six starts.\n\nEven though the numbers do not look good, it's actually slightly impressive that St. Louis remains in the postseason mix. Mozeliak wouldn't commit to the team potentially trading for another starter because of some intriguing prospects currently in Triple-A:\n\n\"We're not going to chase something or do something that doesn't make sense or you have to overpay for,\" Mozeliak said.\n\nIt's hard to know what the Cardinals will get from Nootbar and Edman specifically. Nootbar is hitting .234 this season with five long balls and 19 RBI. He just missed almost six weeks with an oblique strain. That's a tricky injury.\n\nAs for Edman, he was supposed to be back a lot sooner. His wrist issue lingered and as we know, that's a complicated injury for baseball players. Edman hasn't played at all in 2024.\n\nIt will be very interesting to see what the Cardinals do at the deadline. That will likely become more clear in the coming weeks.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "quinn_allen@clutchpoints.com",

They are throwing, and hitting the ball well. Offensively, the Royals have to be at the top of their game to win this one. Kansas City is 11th in barrel percentage, 10th in hard hit percentage, fifth in average exit velocity, ninth in doubles, and 12th in runs scored. The Royals need to continue hitting the ball well if they want to win this game.\n\nMichael Wacha is on the mound for this one, and he is having a very respectable season. He has a great chance to have another good game Tuesday night. The Cardinals are bottom-10 in the MLB in barrel percentage, hard hit percentage, average exit velocity, home runs, and xSlugging perecntage. St. Louis does not hit the ball well, and the Royals should be able to take advantage of that.\n\nWhy The Cardinals Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nPallante has been a little better as a starter this season. His strikeout rate is about 11 percent higher as a starter, and his opponent batting average is much lower. Along with that, his ERA as a starter this season is 3.34. He has pitched well since moving into the starting rotation, and that should continue in this game. If Pallante can carry his momentum into this game, the Cardinals will win this game.\n\nThe Cardinals will have to find a way to hit the ball well in this game. As mentioned, they have struggled all season, but they are coming off a good weekend, and they have been hitting well in their last 10 games. In those games, St. Louis is batting .264 with a .721 OPS, and 46 runs scored. The Cardinals should be able to keep that momentum going in this game. If they can do that, the Cardinals will win this game.\n\nFinal Royals-Cardinals Prediction & Pick\n\nWith how both teams are playing at the moment, this should be a good game, and a good series. The Royals are the better team on paper, but the Cardinals are playing well lately. As mentioned, Pallante is throwing well as a starter, and Wacha has been great in his return to the mound. I am going to take the Royals to win this game. Wacha has the hot hand, and I think it will continue here.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Pallante", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andre Pallante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_Kansas_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports Kansas City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_Midwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports Midwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wacha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Wacha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_against", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average against"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Royals-vs.-Cardinals-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717734", "eventUri": "eng-9717734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

His quick rise got him there.", "body": "Once he arrived in Springfield, Missouri, at the end of June, Cardinals prospect Quinn Mathews had already been so \"overwhelmed\" with the movement brought on by his second minor league promotion this season that he did not fully take in the moment he learned of his next milestone.\n\nThe lefty, days after receiving a promotion from Class High-A, joined his new club, met his new manager, and found out he was headed to this year's All-Star Futures Game. But with a focus on not wanting to be late for the team stretch on his first day with Class AA Springfield, it took the 23-year-old left-hander some time, and a conversation with teammate Tink Hence, for the news to fully sink in.\n\n\"I didn't really think it was a goal or even an expectation for myself coming into the year,\" Mathews said of the Futures Game selection during a recent phone interview. \"From what it sounded like, it basically acknowledged the big-name prospects who were performing in their own regards, and I really wasn't going to be in that conversation, especially being, as everyone had told me, old for a first-year player. It really wasn't on my radar.

Alongside Mathews, Hence, the Cardinals' top pitching prospect, earned Futures Game honors.\n\nIn his first year of professional baseball after getting drafted by the Cardinals in the fourth round of the 2023 MLB draft, Mathews has a 6-2 record, a 2.22 ERA, and has struck out 120 batters over 85 innings across three levels of minor league baseball. The Stanford University product opened the year with Class Low-A Palm Beach and, with improved fastball velocity and steady command, received promotions to Class High-A Peoria and Class AA Springfield before July.\n\n\"What I think makes (Mathews) such a fun story is that once we did draft him, he got with (farm director) Gary LaRocque and (senior minor league pitching coordinator) Tim Leveque and our performance group, and in the absence of innings pitched, he asked, well, what's the next step? And he followed it to a tee,\" Cardinals scouting director Randy Flores said in a recent phone interview.\n\nAfter not throwing a pitch as a pro in 2023, Mathews spent his offseason in his hometown of Aliso Viejo, California, and made the most of it. He added 25 pounds to his 6-foot-5 frame by following a weightlifting and nutrition plan and stuck to a throwing program intended to help him increase his fastball velocity.\n\nMathews has flashed as high as 97.3 mph and earned Cardinals minor league pitcher of the month honors twice (in April and June) through his first 15 starts as a pro. He entered Tuesday ranked second across the minors in total strikeouts and fourth in strikeout rate (36.5%), per FanGraphs.\n\n\"Accolades are cool, but I mean, at the end of the day, the ultimate goal is to get to the big-league level and help the St. Louis Cardinals win as many games as possible,\" Mathews said. \"... Obviously it's awesome, but at the end of the day, I still need to get better. I still need to keep improving each and every time I take the mound.\"\n\nNearly a year after he became the 122nd overall pick as he \"checked a lot\" of the boxes the Cardinals look for in draft prospects, Mathews has gone from a Stanford standout who made headlines with a 156-pitch complete game against the University of Texas in the 2023 NCAA Super Regionals to blossoming as one of the Cardinals' top pitching prospects.\n\nMathews said he looks to keep the same approach until \"baseball tells you it needs to change.\" Having leaped two minor league levels, Mathews believes that staying \"grounded\" amid the rapid rise can be a key in getting \"exposed\" as he looks to get settled in and progress from a new level of baseball.\n\nWith the constant change, the 23-year-old credits those around him in his personal life as the ones who have helped him remain consistent mentally as he uses his draft day experience as a motivating factor.\n\n\"I would say most guys believe they should go higher than they probably evidently do, and I felt like I was one of those guys,\" Mathews said. \"For me, it was just an extra little bit of motivation for like, 'Hey, let's go out and do what we do best, which is pitch.' ... Going in the fourth round is still phenomenal but obviously not the tippy top and there's nothing wrong with that. But if I think I'm as good as I am, then I just need to go out there and professional baseball and do it, and everything will take care of itself.\"\n\nWet weather sets up Cards-Royals twin bill\n\nThe Cardinals and Royals are set to play a split doubleheader on Wednesday at Busch Stadium after inclement weather washed out Tuesday's series opener. First pitch for Game 1 of the doubleheader is scheduled for 12:45 p.m. St. Louis time. Game 2 is expected to start at its originally scheduled 6:45 p.m. start time.\n\nThe Cardinals have listed Andre Pallante as their Game 1 starter. Sonny Gray is the team's listed starter for the nightcap. Gray was previously slated to start Wednesday's originally scheduled game. The Royals have Alec Marsh as their probable Game 1 starter and former Cardinal Michael Wacha as their Game 2 starter.\n\nTickets for Tuesday's postponed game will be valid for Game 1 on Wednesday. Paid ticket holders will also receive an electronic voucher redeemable for a future Monday through Thursday 2024 Cardinals regular season home game.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com",

Mandatory Credit: Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports /\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals are sitting at second in the National League Central, and are in a position to acquire a former All-Star to strengthen their bullpen.\n\nWith the July 30 trade deadline looming, the Cardinals' mid-season turnaround has placed them in a position to be buyers in just a few weeks. Though their bullpen is one of Major League Baseball's best, one reliever who is rumored to be traded would be a massive addition.\n\n\"The Angels are getting bombarded with interest for closer Carlos Est\u00e9vez, who may be the best reliever available on the market,\" USA Today's Bob Nightengale wrote on Sunday.\n\nEst\u00e9vez has a 2.89 ERA with a 28-to-4 strikeout-to-walk ratio, .192 batting average against and a 0.82 WHIP in 28 innings pitched across 28 games. He's also converted 16 saves in 19 opportunities.\n\nWhile the Cardinals have the best closer in baseball, right-hander Ryan Helsley, it's always wise to find high-leverage options that are comfortable closing in a pinch.\n\nThe righty is rumored to be a hot commodity this summer, so St. Louis would need to act fast to get a deal done with the Angels. The priority would be to bolster the end of the rotation but if Cardinals president of baseball operations John Mozeliak wants to get greedy, it would make sense to further bolster the pitching staff with another shutdown reliever.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Montgomery", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Stratton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Stratton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mozeliak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Mozeliak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Busch Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Est\u00e9vez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Est\u00e9vez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Helsley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Helsley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_against", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average against"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout-to-walk_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout-to-walk ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1199,h_674,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/inside_the_cardinals/01j2awt0y1a99sqz94jp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717734", "eventUri": "eng-9717734", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 532, "textEnd": 539}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Their lineup has plenty of star power with Bobby Witt and Slavador Perez. However, Vinnie Pasquantino, Michael Massey, and Freddy Fermin are all hitting the ball well. The Royals need to continue this against Gray. In his last two starts, Gray has thrown 9.1 innings, allowed 15 hits, 11 runs (eight earned), and his ERA has risen by 0.49. The Royals could have a chance to do some damage in this game if they put up good at-bats.\n\nThe Royals need Marsh to have one of his better games in this one. Before his last start, Marsh had two good starts in a row. He needs to get back to that. Marsh should be able to have a good game in this one. The Cardinals tend to struggle with their bats at times, and it would not be surprising to see this be one of those games.\n\nWhy The Cardinals Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nGordon Graceffo pitched very well in his Major League debut. He pitched against a hot Reds team, and was able to shut them down out of the pen. He will be the starting pitcher for this game, and that is where he is comfortable. In his game against the Reds, he got opposing hitters to chase plenty of pitches, and he had a 33.3 percent whiff rate. Graceffo should be able to get extended in this game, and there is no reason to believe he will not have the same type of outing.\n\nIn the month of July, the Cardinals are playing well. They are hitting just under .300, and they have a .786 OPS. They are averaging just under six runs per game, as well. St. Louis has picked up steam, and they are threatening the top of the NL Central. The Cardinals are much better at home this season, as well.

It will be made up in a Wednesday doubleheader. Watch for our more complete story later today.\n\nThe 2024 edition of the I-70 Series kicks off tonight when the Royals face the Cardinals in St. Louis. Scheduled to pitch are Michael Wacha for Kansas City and Andre Pallante for St. Louis.\n\nWacha, 5-6 with a 3.74 ERA, spent the first seven of his 12 big league seasons with the Cardinals and went 59-39, 3.91 in 165 appearances before moving on to the Mets, Tampa Bay, Boston, and San Diego before signing a free agent deal with Kansas City over the winter.\n\nPallante is in his third Cardinal campaign and is 4-3, 4.00 in 16 games (seven starts) this season.\n\nThe Royals began Tuesday in third place in the American League Central; they've been there since dropping out of second June 29. The Cards are in second place in the National League Central.\n\nTonight's first pitch is scheduled for 6:45 p.m. CDT at Busch Stadium. Bally Sports Kansas City and Bally Sports Midwest both have the telecast. And as usual, Royals fans can listen on Kansas City's KCSP-AM 610 Sports Radio and the other stations on the Royals Radio Network.\n\nThe teams conclude their two-game series Wednesday at 6:45 p.m. CDT. Their home-and-home matchups for this season end when St. Louis visits Kauffman Stadium Aug. 9 and 10.\n\nKris Bubic enjoyed a good return to the majors Sunday\n\nJust in case you missed it, Bubic is back with the Royals after missing over a year of big league action while rehabilitating from Tommy John Surgery. Reactivated as part of the moves the club made Saturday, including the return of reliever Walter Pennington to the minors, Bubic pitched the final frame of KC's lopsided 10-1 victory over Colorado Sunday and struck out two Rockies in his three-up, three-down inning.\n\nFormer Royals prospect Logan Porter is still hitting\n\nAlmost a month has passed since Kansas City did right by Logan Porter and traded him to the Giants. Despite playing well for parts of three seasons at Triple-A Omaha, especially at the plate, and showing a knack for getting on base -- he boasts a six-season .403 minor league OBP -- Porter received only a late 2023 season call to the majors. It had become abundantly clear he had no future with the Royals when they sent him to San Francisco in a player-for-cash deal.\n\nPorter hasn't made it to the Giants yet, but that doesn't mean he's faring badly at Triple-A Sacramento. Porter is hitting .291 with a .365 OBP and a pair of home runs in 16 games for the River Cats.", "source": {"uri": "kingsofkauffman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kings Of Kauffman"}, "authors":

Marsh has never faced the Cardinals.\n\nPallante began the season in St. Louis's bullpen but moved to the rotation at the end of May. He's mostly fared well, pitching to a 3.34 ERA in seven starts. He's thrown up a couple clunkers but has allowed zero or one earned run in five of those starts. Pallante last faced the Royals in relief last August, allowing three runs over two innings of work.\n\nThis page will be updated with info for game two following game one.", "source": {"uri": "royalsreview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Royals Review"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_walker@royalsreview.com", "name": "Greg Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_70", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 70"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubleheader_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doubleheader (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Pallante", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Pallante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2FaK9O9cYEGoKiq5_xPaGazBW-Y=/0x250:3000x1750/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25525186/1499899376.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717734", "eventUri": "eng-9717734", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports / Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals have been in a plethora of rumors lately as the 2024 Major League Baseball trade deadline gets closer.\n\nSt. Louis has been one of the best teams in baseball over the last six weeks and now is expected to add at the trade deadline. It has been said that the Cardinals could use help specifically in the starting rotation.\n\nThe Cardinals will be busy over the next three weeks and some have even speculated that the club could consider trading young phenom Jordan Walker at the deadline to bolster the rotation.\n\nWhile this is the case, The Athletic's Ken Rosenthal stated that he doesn't expect a trade to happen involving Walker.\n\n\"I know it's going to be a topic of discussion, but Jordan Walker is in Triple-A right now not really hitting all that well,\" Rosenthal said. \"They're trying to make some adjustments for him and he's trying to get to a point where he is a better player than he has been.\n\n\"He has all the promise in the world but you would be trading him at a low point, you'd be selling low. We all know the Cardinals have been burned trading outfielders over the years one after another...I'm not sure they want to make that move with Jordan Walker just yet.\n\nWalker was the Cardinals' top prospect and had a strong rookie season last year when he slashed .276/.342/.445 with 16 home runs and 51 RBIs. He struggled in 20 games to kick off the campaign and has been in the minors ever since.\n\nWalker has plenty of potential and although he has been mentioned as a trade candidate, it would be shocking to see him get moved.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Walker_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Walker (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Rosenthal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ken Rosenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5184,h_2916,x_0,y_291/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_cardinals/01j2chscf5nhgs4yrfcd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717734", "eventUri": "eng-9717734", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-04-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

His quick rise got him there.", "body": "Once he arrived in Springfield, Missouri, at the end of June, Cardinals prospect Quinn Mathews had already been so \"overwhelmed\" with the movement brought on by his second minor league promotion this season that he did not fully take in the moment he learned of his next milestone.\n\nThe lefty, days after receiving a promotion from Class High-A, joined his new club, met his new manager, and found out he was headed to this year's All-Star Futures Game. But with a focus on not wanting to be late for the team stretch on his first day with Class AA Springfield, it took the 23-year-old left-hander some time, and a conversation with teammate Tink Hence, for the news to fully sink in.\n\n\"I didn't really think it was a goal or even an expectation for myself coming into the year,\" Mathews said of the Futures Game selection during a recent phone interview. \"From what it sounded like, it basically acknowledged the big-name prospects who were performing in their own regards, and I really wasn't going to be in that conversation, especially being, as everyone had told me, old for a first-year player. It really wasn't on my radar. But fortunately, things worked out.\"\n\nMathews was one of two Cardinals prospects selected to this year's Futures Game at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, on Saturday. Alongside Mathews, Hence, the Cardinals' top pitching prospect, earned Futures Game honors.\n\nIn his first year of professional baseball after getting drafted by the Cardinals in the fourth round of the 2023 MLB draft, Mathews has a 6-2 record, a 2.22 ERA, and has struck out 120 batters over 85 innings across three levels of minor league baseball. The Stanford University product opened the year with Class Low-A Palm Beach and, with improved fastball velocity and steady command, received promotions to Class High-A Peoria and Class AA Springfield before July.\n\n\"What I think makes (Mathews) such a fun story is that once we did draft him, he got with (farm director) Gary LaRocque and (senior minor league pitching coordinator) Tim Leveque and our performance group, and in the absence of innings pitched, he asked, well, what's the next step? And he followed it to a tee,\" Cardinals scouting director Randy Flores said in a recent phone interview.\n\nAfter not throwing a pitch as a pro in 2023, Mathews spent his offseason in his hometown of Aliso Viejo, California, and made the most of it. He added 25 pounds to his 6-foot-5 frame by following a weightlifting and nutrition plan and stuck to a throwing program intended to help him increase his fastball velocity.\n\nMathews has flashed as high as 97.3 mph and earned Cardinals minor league pitcher of the month honors twice (in April and June) through his first 15 starts as a pro. He entered Tuesday ranked second across the minors in total strikeouts and fourth in strikeout rate (36.5%), per FanGraphs.\n\n\"Accolades are cool, but I mean, at the end of the day, the ultimate goal is to get to the big-league level and help the St. Louis Cardinals win as many games as possible,\" Mathews said. \"... Obviously it's awesome, but at the end of the day, I still need to get better. I still need to keep improving each and every time I take the mound.\"\n\nNearly a year after he became the 122nd overall pick as he \"checked a lot\" of the boxes the Cardinals look for in draft prospects, Mathews has gone from a Stanford standout who made headlines with a 156-pitch complete game against the University of Texas in the 2023 NCAA Super Regionals to blossoming as one of the Cardinals' top pitching prospects.\n\nMathews said he looks to keep the same approach until \"baseball tells you it needs to change.\" Having leaped two minor league levels, Mathews believes that staying \"grounded\" amid the rapid rise can be a key in getting \"exposed\" as he looks to get settled in and progress from a new level of baseball.\n\nWith the constant change, the 23-year-old credits those around him in his personal life as the ones who have helped him remain consistent mentally as he uses his draft day experience as a motivating factor.\n\n\"I would say most guys believe they should go higher than they probably evidently do, and I felt like I was one of those guys,\" Mathews said. \"For me, it was just an extra little bit of motivation for like, 'Hey, let's go out and do what we do best, which is pitch.' ... Going in the fourth round is still phenomenal but obviously not the tippy top and there's nothing wrong with that. But if I think I'm as good as I am, then I just need to go out there and professional baseball and do it, and everything will take care of itself.\"\n\nThe Cardinals and Royals are set to play a split doubleheader on Wednesday at Busch Stadium after inclement weather washed out Tuesday's series opener. First pitch for Game 1 of the doubleheader is scheduled for 12:45 p.m. St. Louis time. Game 2 is expected to start at its originally scheduled 6:45 p.m. start time.\n\nThe Cardinals have listed Andre Pallante as their Game 1 starter. Sonny Gray is the team's listed starter for the nightcap. Gray was previously slated to start Wednesday's originally scheduled game. The Royals have Alec Marsh as their probable Game 1 starter and former Cardinal Michael Wacha as their Game 2 starter.", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis

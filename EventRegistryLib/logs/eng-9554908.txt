Direct reporting into the home secretary makes absolute sense to give a clear independent voice into the heart of government.\"\n\nLabour said its plan for a new border security commander would go further than the government's small boats commander role, with significantly more resources and a remit to work across Europe and coordinate across multiple agencies.\n\nStarmer will contrast Labour's plan with the \"gimmick\" of the Rwanda scheme, which is estimated to cost \u00a31.8m for every asylum seeker sent there - though no deportation flights have yet taken off.\n\n\"It's not hard to see why the prime minister might want a path to deterrence without the hard graft, the boring graft maybe, of fixing the wider system,\" Starmer will say.\n\n\"Let me spell it out again - a scheme that will only remove 1% of small boat crossings a year can not, and never will be, an effective deterrent.\"\n\nHe will say the Rwanda scheme will lead to a \"perma-backlog of nearly 100,000 people\" and that refusing to process asylum claims will mean \"that even if they have absolutely no right to be here they cannot be removed, billing the taxpayer for expensive hotel accommodation\".\n\nHe will add: \"The government has achieved the complete opposite of what they claim - a Travelodge amnesty, handed out by the Tory party that, if nothing else, is warmer and safer than spending winter under canvas near a beach in northern France.\"\n\nLabour said last week that it would let people who had crossed on small boats into the asylum system, contrary to the Illegal Migration Act, which effectively bars any individual who comes to the UK illegally from claiming asylum.\n\nThe government has said those stuck in asylum limbo - estimated at about 90,000 people - will be removed to Rwanda. But Labour has said that will take almost 100 years at current rates, and it will instead \"get a grip on the asylum process, to clear the backlog with a fast track for safe countries and remove those with no right to be here\".\n\nStarmer and the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, have previously said that no deportation flights to Rwanda will take off if Labour takes power, despite speculation the party would let the scheme continue until a new system was in place.\n\nStarmer will say on Friday that Labour's plan would \"restore integrity and rules to our asylum system\" and that hundreds of caseworkers would be hired for a new fast-track returns and enforcement unit.\n\nThe Labour leader will pledge to make British beaches \"hostile territory\" for people smugglers with new investigative powers modelled on anti-terror laws. \"It's a vile trade that preys on the desperation and hope it finds in its victims,\" he will say.\n\nIn a veiled criticism of the French operations, Starmer will say he will work harder with French police to stop the boats departing. \"The gangs now use dinghies that are on a scale way beyond anything you would see for legitimate recreational activity,\" he will say. \"We should turn over every stone and use every reasonable power - that is my message to the smugglers: these shores will become hostile territory for you.\"\n\nThe home secretary, James Cleverly, said Labour's new plan was \"an amnesty for all illegal immigrants, scrapping our Rwanda plan even if it's working\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

She announced on Wednesday she was defecting from the Tories to Labour as Rishi Sunak' Government is \"failing to keep our borders safe and secure\".\n\nMr Starmer will set out plans for a new Border Security Command bringing together the National Crime Agency, Immigration Enforcement and MI5, while hiring hundreds of new specialist investigators to work across the UK and Europe to tackle human trafficking gangs.\n\nHe will vow to use his experience as the country's top prosecutor, when he put terrorists and dangerous criminals behind bars, to make Britain \"hostile territory\" for people smugglers. Under his proposals, powers created in 2000 by the Terrorism Act will be used to seize and examine the mobile phones of suspected smugglers, as well as monitor their bank accounts.\n\nOver 8,800 people have arrived on small boats across the Channel so far this year, which is a 32% increase compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nMr Starmer said the new Border Security Command - which will be led by a former police, military or intelligence chief - will be paid for by axing the Government's \u00a3500million Rwanda scheme, which he will warn \"never will be, an effective deterrent\" as it will only remove 1% of arrivals. \"It's an insult to anyone's intelligence, and the gangs that run this sick trade are not easily fooled,\" he will add.\n\nMr Starmer will also pledge to speed up decisions on whether people who come here are granted asylum or removed. Some 52,000 people are currently stuck in the backlog, while living in taxpayer-funded accommodation.\n\n\"We have to restore integrity and rules to our asylum system. We have to clear the backlog. That is the path - the only path - to real deterrence,\" he will say. \"So we will hire hundreds of new caseworkers for the Home Office - and we'll do it immediately - we will create a new fast-track Returns and Enforcement Unit.\n\n\"We will ensure our courts can process claims quickly, and we will save the taxpayer billions. \"Labour will stop the chaos. Labour will bust the backlogs. Labour will rebuild our broken asylum system.\"\n\nIn contrast, he will warn that the Government's approach to the problem has demonstrated their \"rank incompetence\".

They would report directly to the Home Secretary and work with international agencies drawing on tough new powers.\n\nThe party says its overhaul of border security would bring together the National Crime Agency, Immigration Enforcement, the Crown Prosecution Service and MI5. It would be paid for using existing resources and \u00a375m earmarked for the first year of Rishi Sunak's Rwanda deportation scheme.\n\nStarmer will also back serious crime prevention orders to be used, with High Court approval, prior to arrest to shut down people smugglers' internet access and bank accounts, and help with tracing gangs' movements.\n\nHe will add: \"I know we use the term small boats, but these boats are not, for the most part, that small. The gangs now use dinghies that are on a scale way beyond anything you would see for legitimate recreational activity.\n\n'We should be working with our European partners to seize those boats, and seize material here in the U.K. to collect further evidence. We should turn over every stone and use every reasonable power - that is my message to the smugglers: these shores will become hostile territory for you.'\n\nSome 8,826 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel so far this year, provisional Home Office figures show.\n\nThis is up 32% on this time last year, when 6,691 migrants were recorded, and a 14% rise compared with the same period in 2022 (7,750), according to PA news agency analysis of the data.\n\nMORE : The situation is dire.

promise to set up a new Border Security Command to crack down on people-smugglers if his party wins power.\n\nThe new unit would be funded by diverting \u00a375m from the Rwanda scheme.\n\nThe plans will be unveiled by Sir Keir in a speech in Dover on Friday.\n\nIt comes after Dover MP Natalie Elphicke defected from the Conservatives to Labour, saying the prime minister had failed to tackle small boat crossings.\n\nHer constituency is the arrival point for many people who make the dangerous journey across the English Channel.\n\nThe government says its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda would deter people from making the crossing.\n\nNo deportation flights have taken off yet as the scheme has been delayed by legal challenges but the government is now hoping for the first flights to be in July.\n\nHowever, in his speech Sir Keir will argue the Rwanda plan cannot be an effective deterrent as only a small proportion of people who arrive on small boats will be sent there.\n\nThe Labour leader will accuse the Conservatives of \"a Travelodge Amnesty\" by not processing asylum claims and housing people in hotels instead.\n\nHe is expected to say his party would \"replace gimmicks with graft\".\n\nLabour has already promised to scrap the Rwanda scheme if it wins the next election and confirmed it would consider asylum claims from people who have arrived in the UK on small boats.\n\nThe party said \u00a375m of the money allocated for the first year of the scheme would fund its plans.\n\nIt is also pledging to hire hundreds more specialist investigators and cross-border police.\n\nMeanwhile, counter-terror powers would be extended to cover organised immigration crime, including the power to search people suspected of being involved in people smuggling, close bank accounts, restrict their travel and trace their movements before an offence has taken place.\n\nThe new Border Security Command would be modelled on the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism set up by the last Labour government and would bring together the National Crime Agency, Immigration Enforcement, the CPS and MI5.\n\nIt would be led by a former police, military or intelligence chief who would report directly to the home secretary.\n\nBut the Conservatives claimed Labour's big idea was what they described as an \"amnesty for illegal immigrants\".\n\nHome Secretary James Cleverly accused Sir Keir of not wanting to control Britain's borders and of wanting to scrap the government's Rwanda plan \"even if it's working\".\n\nMore than 6,200 people have

We should turn every stone and use every reasonable power. That is my message to the smugglers: these shores will become hostile territory for you.\"\n\nThe announcement on immigration will be seen as an attempt to seize the initiative on a difficult policy area for the party as Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, seeks to get the first migrant flights off to Rwanda in July. Last week, Labour said it would consider the asylum claims of more than 90,000 migrants who entered the UK illegally if it won the election.\n\nLabour said the new border security command, headed by a former police, military or intelligence chief, would work with international agencies to smash the trafficking gangs and put Britain's police at the heart of pan-European efforts to counter people smuggling. The announcement comes after speculation that Labour wants to rebuild closer ties with the EU\n\nThe centre would be modelled on the Office for Security and Counter-terrorism set up by the last Labour government to overhaul the approach to national security.\n\nIt would be supported by up to 1,000 additional officers recruited by MI5, the National Crime Agency (NCA), Border Force and police - paid for by \u00a375 million a year that would have been spent on sending migrants to Rwanda. Recruitment, including for the commander, would start within weeks of a Labour election victory.\n\nOfficers would get expanded powers under the 2000 Terrorism Act for enhanced stop and search powers for organised immigration crime, enabling them to carry out personal searches, examine and seize mobile phones and copy any data on the devices.\n\nLike terrorism police, officers could get warrants to search suspected people smugglers' premises and seize items before an offence was committed and apply to courts for early access to financial information on suspects.\n\nThey could also use serious crime prevention orders to restrict access to the internet, banking and travel of suspected people smugglers before they were convicted.\n\nStarmer urges the rejection of 'performative symbols'\n\nSir Keir will acknowledge that rebuilding the asylum system will be a \"trial of leadership to resist the voices who fundamentally do not want to rebuild a functioning asylum system\".\n\nSources suggested he was referring to those both on the Left seeking to restore open borders and those on the Right wanting to bar illegal migrants from claiming asylum.\n\n\"It's become a question of whether you can prioritise, at all times, the politics of practical solutions, and reject the politics of performative symbols - the gimmicks and gestures,\" he will say.\n\nSome 8,826 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel so far this year, according to Home Office figures. This is up 32 per cent on this time last year, when 6,691 migrants were recorded, and a 14 per cent rise compared with the same period in 2022.\n\nSir Keir will say: \"It is my firm belief, after years of experience in this area, that we need new and stronger powers to enforce the law and bring these smugglers to justice. Powers that in some areas, counter-terrorism most obviously, we have enhanced in recognition of the dangers posed to our security.\n\n\"It's not hard to see why the Prime Minister might want a path to deterrence without the hard graft, the boring graft maybe, of fixing the wider system. But I'm afraid, like so much of what he says these days, it's sticking plasters. Gimmicks, not serious government.\"\n\nReferring to the Government's plan to deport migrants arriving illegally to Rwanda, he said: \"Let me spell it out again. A scheme that will only remove 1 per cent of small boat crossings a year can not, and never will be, an effective deterrent. It's an insult to anyone's intelligence, and the gangs that run this sick trade are not easily fooled.\"\n\nA Tory source said: \"Labour voted over a hundred times against the Government to give us more powers to tackle this global challenge and has no replacement, no deterrent, no safe third destination and true to form will stop the Rwanda partnership 'even if it works'.\"\n\nThe source added: \"Starmer's 'new plan' is his old plan, which is no plan.\"\n\nBasu criticised Braverman's immigration stance\n\nIt is not the first time that Labour has recruited a police chief to help devise its policies. Lord Stevens, a former Met Police commissioner, chaired a commission set up by Labour in 2011 to draw up proposals for neighbourhood policing.\n\nSteve Otter, the former Devon and Cornwall chief constable, was a member of an expert Labour commission under Dame Vera Baird, the former victims' commissioner, which was tasked with drawing up reforms to increase the number of crimes solved. It reported its recommendations earlier this year.\n\nMr Basu was approached by Labour to advise on the immigration plans because of his counter terror experience. He retired from the Met in 2022 after controversially being overlooked for the job of head of the National Crime Agency.\n\nAs one of the most senior police officers of Asian heritage, he has spoken out on race issues and criticised Suella Braverman for her language on immigration as home secretary.\n\n\"It is unbelievable to hear a succession of very powerful politicians who look like this talking in language that my father would have remembered from 1968. It's horrific,\" he said.\n\nMs Elphicke is expected to join Sir Keir at the speech in Dover. She accused Mr Sunak of failing to deliver on his promise to stop the boats when she defected on Wednesday.\n\nHer defection was greeted with surprise by Conservatives, with Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, saying it showed Labour stood for nothing and Gillian Keegan, the Education Secretary, saying she was a \"very odd fit\" for the Opposition.\n\nNeil Basu\n\nThe Rwanda scheme is a gamble -

Keir Starmer is set to announce.\n\nThe \"elite\" unit, to be part-funded by scrapping the Tories' Rwanda deportation scheme, will be led by a former police, military or intelligence chief and be granted new powers under the Counter Terrorism Act.\n\nPolitics Live: New Labour MP's apology 'unlikely to change minds'\n\nThese powers will allow officers to conduct stop and searches at the border, carry out financial investigations and issue search and seizure warrants targeting organised immigration crime.\n\nSir Keir will outline the measures in a speech on the Kent coast on Friday, when he will vow to \"replace gimmicks with graft\" and draw on his experience as the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nThe Labour leader will say: \"Let's be clear at the start, these are criminal enterprises we are dealing with.\n\n\"A business that pits nation against nation, thrives in the grey areas of our rules, the cracks between our institutions, where, they believe, they can exploit some of the most vulnerable people in the world with impunity.\n\n\"It's a vile trade that preys on the desperation and hope it finds in its victims.\"\n\nThe speech comes after the defection of Dover MP Natalie Elphicke, who joined Labour from the Conservatives on Wednesday, accusing the prime minister of failing to deliver on his promise to \"stop the boats\".\n\nThe move was met with shock and bafflement on the Conservative benches, given Ms Elphicke has previously attacked Sir Keir on immigration and seen as being on the right of her party.\n\nIt left some Labour MPs less than impressed too, with the Brexiteer apologising on Thursday over past comments supporting her sex offender ex-husband.\n\nMs Elphicke said the \"key deciding factors\" in her defection were housing issues and \"the safety and security of our borders\".\n\nSpeaking from the constituency of his newest MP, Sir Keir will accuse the government of \"rank incompetence\" on immigration, dismissing the Rwanda scheme as being unable to provide an effective deterrent and accusing the Conservatives of operating a \"Travelodge amnesty\" by housing migrants in hotels rather than processing their claims.\n\nOver 52,000 people are stuck in the asylum backlog while some 8,826 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel so far this year, provisional Home Office figures show.\n\nThis is up 32% on this time last year, when 6,691 migrants were recorded, and a 14% rise compared with the same period in 2022 (7,750), according to PA news agency analysis of the data.\n\nRead More:\n\nLabour insists no place for Farage in party after defection\n\nUK considered using Iraq to process asylum seekers\n\nLabour has previously vowed to scrap the Rwanda scheme and

anti-terror powers to break small boats gangs", "body": "Labour will use new counter-terrorism powers to tackle people-smuggling gangs bringing migrants across the Channel in small boats, Sir Keir Starmer is set to announce on Friday.\n\nIn a speech on the Kent coast, the Labour leader will set out his party's plans to tackle the small boats crisis if it wins the general election.\n\nSir Keir is expected to say Labour will \"replace gimmicks with graft\", scrapping the Government's Rwanda scheme and using some of the money saved to fund a new \"elite Border Security Command\" led by a former police, military or intelligence chief.\n\nAttacking the Government's approach as \"rank incompetence\", he is expected to dismiss the Rwanda scheme as being unable to provide an effective deterrent and accuse the Conservatives of operating a \"Travelodge amnesty\" by housing migrants in hotels rather than processing their claims.\n\nSir Keir will also stress his experience as the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service and pledge to make Britain \"hostile territory\" for people smugglers.\n\nHe will say: \"Let's be clear at the start, these are criminal enterprises we are dealing with.\n\n\"A business that pits nation against nation, thrives in the grey areas of our rules, the cracks between our institutions, where, they believe, they can exploit some of the most vulnerable people in the world with impunity.\n\n\"It's a vile trade that preys on the desperation and hope it finds in its victims.\"\n\nAmong the measures set to be proposed by Sir Keir are new border control stop and searches, building on powers created in 2000 by the Terrorism Act, along with new financial investigation powers and search and seizure warrants targeting organised immigration crime.\n\nThe new Border Security Command would bring together agencies including the National Crime Agency, Immigration Enforcement and MI5, while Labour will also pledge to hire hundreds of new specialist investigators to work across the UK and Europe to tackle people smuggling.\n\nSir Keir will say: \"Rebuilding our asylum system has become a test of political strength, a trial of leadership to resist the voices who fundamentally do not want to rebuild a functioning asylum system.\n\n\"It's become a question of whether you can prioritise, at all times, the politics of practical solutions, and reject the politics of performative symbols, the gimmicks and gestures.\"\n\nThe speech comes after the defection of Dover MP Natalie Elphicke, who joined Labour from the Conservatives on Wednesday, accusing the Prime Minister of failing to deliver on his promise to \"stop the boats\".\n\nWelcoming Ms Elphicke to the Labour Party, Sir Keir said: \"What is the point of this failed Government staggering on when the Tory MP for Dover, on the front line of the small boats crisis, says the Prime Minister cannot be trusted with our borders and joins Labour?\"\n\nMs Elphicke's defection was greeted with surprise by Conservatives, with Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron saying it showed Labour stood for nothing and Education Secretary Gillian Keegan saying she was a \"very odd fit\" for the opposition.\n\nSome 8,826 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel so far this year, provisional Home Office figures show.\n\nThis is up 32% on this time last year, when 6,691 migrants were recorded, and a 14% rise compared with the same period in 2022 (7,750), according to PA news agency analysis of the data.\n\nCampaigners warned that the current asylum system is in \"meltdown\" and is \"only going to get worse\" unless urgent changes are made.\n\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said \"whoever is in government\" must focus on ensuring fairness in the system above anything else, adding: \"The Illegal Migration Act must be scrapped immediately, along with plans to ship people off on a one-way ticket to Rwanda.\n\n\"Instead of wasting time on legislation that bans the right to asylum and dehumanises people who simply need safety, there must be a fair, efficient and humane asylum system.\"", "source": {"uri": "ayradvertiser.com",

Meanwhile this Government will continue working to stop the boats.'\n\nSir Keir will declare it is his 'firm belief' that 'we also need new and stronger powers to enforce the law and bring these smugglers to justice'.\n\nHe will say: 'I know we use the term small boats, but these boats are not, for the most part, that small.\n\n'The gangs now use dinghies on a scale way beyond anything you would see for legitimate recreational activity.

That work has proved challenging. Nearly 1,500 people arrived in the UK by small boat last week alone, taking the total so far in 2024 to more than 8,500 -- 36 per cent higher than the same period last year.\n\nA former government insider poured cold water on the idea Labour could more effectively tackle networks of people smugglers, saying simply: \"What does Labour think we've been trying to do? You can't just stop the gangs.\"\n\nStarmer has been categorical that he would end the Rwanda scheme as soon as a Labour government comes to power, irrespective of whether flights had already started taking migrants to Kigali.\n\nLabour argues it would not be necessary to repeal the Rwanda bill that received royal assent last month as the legislation does not compel officials to send people overseas.\n\nThe party also says it would scrap a new government scheme that allows asylum seekers to voluntarily opt to move to Rwanda for \u00a33,000 in cash, because it is too costly.\n\nThe Illegal Migration Act -- which passed last year -- bans anyone who arrived in the UK 'illegally' after March 2023 from claiming asylum, meaning there are now tens of thousands of people stuck in limbo in the system.\n\nThere are more than 40,000 people that have arrived in the UK since the IMA was passed whose claims are currently deemed 'inadmissible', according to Home Office officials, and this number could double by the end of the year.\n\nLabour says it would start processing these cases soon after coming to power. To do this, legal experts say it would have to repeal or disapply parts of the Illegal Migration Act that prevent the Home Office from processing the claims.\n\nTo deal with this backlog, Labour says it would recruit over 1,000 Home Office caseworkers, on top of the 2,400 already hired by the government by the end of last year.\n\nCritics of Labour's plans say that repealing the Illegal Migration Act and terminating the Rwanda scheme will remove the only plausible deterrents to irregular migration.\n\nBut Labour says it will devote energy and resources to creating new returns agreements, both with the EU and bilaterally with states where large numbers of asylum seekers are coming from.\n\nReturns of migrants have plummeted over the past decade. Migration experts say this is in part because it has become prohibitively expensive to transport people against their will overseas, with the government having to rely on costly charter arrangements after a backlash against the use of commercial flights.\n\nOne person who has advised Labour on its migration strategy said the party would have some \"crunchy and immediate\" decisions as soon as it comes to power. They conceded that negotiating new returns agreements with EU countries may not reduce the overall number of people coming to the UK to claim asylum.\n\nBut they said this would still be an improvement. \"People arriving in a planned way on ferries is a very different proposition to people pitching up on a beach.\"\n\nColin Yeo, an immigration barrister, argued that it may not be necessary for a Labour government to reduce the net number of asylum seekers entering the UK if it can reduce the reliance on costly asylum hotels and show it had significantly increased the number of migrant removals overseas.\n\nThis, he argued, was more \"realistic and humane\" than the current government's strategy. \"It's part of a plausible public policy response in a way that Rwanda just isn't,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki",

We should turn every stone and use every reasonable power. That is my message to the smugglers: these shores will become hostile territory for you.\"\n\nThe announcement on immigration will be seen as an attempt to seize the initiative on a difficult policy area for the party as Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, seeks to get the first migrant flights off to Rwanda in July. Last week, Labour said it would consider the asylum claims of more than 90,000 migrants who entered the UK illegally if it won the election.\n\nLabour said the new border security command, headed by a former police, military or intelligence chief, would work with international agencies to smash the trafficking gangs and put Britain's police at the heart of pan-European efforts to counter people smuggling. The announcement comes after speculation that Labour wants to rebuild closer ties with the EU\n\nThe centre would be modelled on the Office for Security and Counter-terrorism set up by the last Labour government to overhaul the approach to national security.\n\nIt would be supported by up to 1,000 additional officers recruited by MI5, the National Crime Agency (NCA), Border Force and police - paid for by \u00a375 million a year that would have been spent on sending migrants to Rwanda. Recruitment, including for the commander, would start within weeks of a Labour election victory.\n\nOfficers would get expanded powers under the 2000 Terrorism Act for enhanced stop and search powers for organised immigration crime, enabling them to carry out personal searches, examine and seize mobile phones and copy any data on the devices.\n\nLike terrorism police, officers could get warrants to search suspected people smugglers' premises and seize items before an offence was committed and apply to courts for early access to financial information on suspects.\n\nThey could also use serious crime prevention orders to restrict access to the internet, banking and travel of suspected people smugglers before they were convicted.\n\nSir Keir will acknowledge that rebuilding the asylum system will be a \"trial of leadership to resist the voices who fundamentally do not want to rebuild a functioning asylum system\".\n\nSources suggested he was referring to those both on the Left seeking to restore open borders and those on the Right wanting to bar illegal migrants from claiming asylum.\n\n\"It's become a question of whether you can prioritise, at all times, the politics of practical solutions, and reject the politics of performative symbols - the gimmicks and gestures,\" he will say.\n\nSome 8,826 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel so far this year, according to Home Office figures. This is up 32 per cent on this time last year, when 6,691 migrants were recorded, and a 14 per cent rise compared with the same period in 2022.\n\nSir Keir will say: \"It is my firm belief, after years of experience in this area, that we need new and stronger powers to enforce the law and bring these smugglers to justice. Powers that in some areas, counter-terrorism most obviously, we have enhanced in recognition of the dangers posed to our security.\n\n\"It's not hard to see why the Prime Minister might want a path to deterrence without the hard graft, the boring graft maybe, of fixing the wider system. But I'm afraid, like so much of what he says these days, it's sticking plasters. Gimmicks, not serious government.\"\n\nReferring to the Government's plan to deport migrants arriving illegally to Rwanda, he said: \"Let me spell it out again. A scheme that will only remove 1 per cent of small boat crossings a year can not, and never will be, an effective deterrent. It's an insult to anyone's intelligence, and the gangs that run this sick trade are not easily fooled.\"\n\nA Tory source said: \"Labour voted over a hundred times against the Government to give us more powers to tackle this global challenge and has no replacement, no deterrent, no safe third destination and true to form will stop the Rwanda partnership 'even if it works'.\"\n\nThe source added: \"Starmer's 'new plan' is his old plan, which is no plan.\"\n\nIt is not the first time that Labour has recruited a police chief to help devise its policies. Lord Stevens, a former Met Police commissioner, chaired a commission set up by Labour in 2011 to draw up proposals for neighbourhood policing.\n\nSteve Otter, the former Devon and Cornwall chief constable, was a member of an expert Labour commission under Dame Vera Baird, the former victims' commissioner, which was tasked with drawing up reforms to increase the number of crimes solved. It reported its recommendations earlier this year.\n\nMr Basu was approached by Labour to advise on the immigration plans because of his counter terror experience. He retired from the Met in 2022 after controversially being overlooked for the job of head of the National Crime Agency.\n\nAs one of the most senior police officers of Asian heritage, he has spoken out on race issues and criticised Suella Braverman for her language on immigration as home secretary.\n\n\"It is unbelievable to hear a succession of very powerful politicians who look like this talking in language that my father would have remembered from the 1968. It's horrific,\" he said.\n\nMs Elphicke is expected to join Sir Keir at the speech in Dover. She accused Mr Sunak of failing to deliver on his promise to stop the boats when she defected on Wednesday.\n\nHer defection was greeted with surprise by Conservatives, with Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, saying it showed Labour stood for nothing and Gillian Keegan, the Education Secretary, saying she was a \"very odd fit\" for the Opposition.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

The issue of illegal migration is set to be a major battleground for both Labour and the governing Conservatives in a national election later this year, with some voters angry over the authorities' failure to stop the tens of thousands of asylum seekers who make the journey across the Channel each year.\n\nIn a speech on the south coast of England, Starmer will say he would end the Conservatives' \"talk tough, do nothing culture\" and that his policy was tough but pragmatic, compared with the government's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda. \"It's become a question of whether you can prioritise, at all times, the politics of practical solutions, and reject the politics of performative symbols - the gimmicks and gestures,\" he will say, according to extracts of the speech.\n\nAlmost eight years after Britain voted to leave the European Union to \"take back control\" of the country's borders, public anger over immigration with the small boat arrivals continues to play an important role in British politics. Starmer, whose party looks set to win the next election according to opinion polls, said his party would create a \"Border Security Command\" that would bring together staff from the police, the domestic intelligence agency and prosecutors to work with international agencies to stop people smuggling.\n\nLabour said the hundreds of new specialist investigators, intelligence agents and cross-border police officers in this new unit would have the powers to carry out searches and to secure warrants to seize assets before an offence has taken place. Starmer has previously said his party would abandon the government's stalled plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda and could seek an EU-wide returns agreement for asylum seekers, possibly accepting quotas of migrants in return for sending back people who arrive illegally.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_smuggling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People smuggling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_57_55_697089.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554908", "eventUri": "eng-9554908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

And they have a right to expect their government to protect that security at every turn.\n\nBut with record numbers of people arriving in small boats crossing the channel to the UK - over 8,500 so far this year and rising - it's no wonder the British people are worried.\n\nThe current system isn't just broken, it's bust. Wave after wave of small boats, an asylum backlog getting ever longer, and criminal gangs making a mint in the process.\n\nThe government is failing in its first duty - to keep our country safe with secure borders.\n\nInstead of tackling the problem upstream and going after the gangs running the trade, our government is letting thousands of boats arrive on our shores with a costly gimmick trying to stop it.\n\nThere's no clearer example of sticking plaster politics than that, and I'm pleased that Natalie Elphicke, the former Tory MP for Dover, has joined the Labour Party citing Rishi Sunak's failure to tackle the small boats crisis.\n\nThis is a serious problem, and it needs a serious answer - hard graft, not gimmicks.\n\nWe need to break the lucrative model being used overseas by criminal gangs and stop the flow of boats coming here and overwhelming our border security teams.\n\nDon't just take my word for it. The Government's own report into Border Force, commissioned by former Home Secretary Priti Patel, found an organisation \"struggling to get out of a cycle of crisis management\".\n\nIt concluded that \"a whole-system approach\" was needed to stop illegal entry by small boats, with enforcement and intelligence agencies working together cross-border to smash the gangs sending people here in the first place. I'm determined to deliver that.\n\nWhen I was the country's chief prosecutor, I smashed terrorist gangs abroad, ironically winning praise from the then Home Secretary, Theresa May.\n\nIf elected Prime Minister, I would smash people-smuggling gangs like I smashed terrorist gangs. And this is how.\n\nWe will end the chaos of multiple different agencies operating at our border, working in siloes, not sharing data and intelligence on the activity of these evil gangs.\n\nInstead, Labour will create a new elite Border Security Command. It will bring together the best brains and the best technology and intelligence to stay one step ahead of the gangs.\n\nIt will work cross-border with the likes of Europol to go after the gangs upstream in France, Germany, Turkey and elsewhere.\n\nWe will use new powers to access bank accounts, track internet use, and follow movements of the criminals in the gangs.\n\nThese vile people smugglers are no better than terrorists, and we should treat them as such.\n\nThey are a threat to the nation's security and a threat to life, so we need to use counter terrorist powers to go after them - that means stop and search powers at the border including personal searches and the seizure of mobile phones for anyone crossing the border suspected of people smuggling.\n\nWe will go further. Britain has one of the finest security services in the world.\n\nSo, we will use the skills of MI5, train hundreds of top investigators and get to work hunting down, arresting and jailing the people smugglers.\n\nThe only real deterrent is a system that works. That's why a new Returns and Enforcement Unit will end the Tory chaos - where currently tens of thousands of asylum seekers are not being processed, detained, or removed. We will recruit more people to the unit to bust the backlog.\n\nThere will be no amnesties. We will uphold our proud tradition as a nation of supporting those fleeing persecution.\n\nAnd at the same time, we will work at speed to send back those who shouldn't be here. In doing so, Labour will end the use of hotels for asylum seekers which is costing the taxpayer almost \u00a38m a day.\n\nCrucially, our plans will bolster our border security so Sun readers can have trust in the asylum system again.\n\nWe need to end the chaos and decline of the Tory years and get Britain back on its feet.

Crammed into rickety boats and dinghies, that are completely unsuited to crossing the world's busiest shipping lane, these people are pawns and victims in a ruthless criminal trade. Like all organised criminals the gangs behind this trade are motivated only by money. They don't care that they're placing people in danger. They don't care when people die. The tragedy highlighted last month by the death of seven-year-old Sarah Alhashimi proves this. She was one of five people who perished in icy waters after leaving the beach at Wimereux, near Boulogne. Their boat was carrying 112 people.\n\nMore lives will be lost unless there's decisive action to dismantle the gangs and disrupt their evil operations. The National Crime Agency (NCA) has been working hard in collaboration with the French authorities, but the record number arriving on British shores this year - almost 9,000 people already - shows there is still far more to do. By the time the craft are in the water it's nearly always too late, so intelligence gathering and law enforcement work must be focused further away from the coastline, stopping the boats and gangs at source and along the routes they take.\n\nThere is no evidence whatsoever that the Rwanda scheme will stop the gangs and deter migrants from getting in their boats; it is a grossly expensive project, costing over \u00a3500 million, that will lead to the removal of only a fraction of asylum seekers who are in the UK. That's a huge gamble with our money and vulnerable people's lives. Instead, what's needed is a radical new law enforcement approach - with stronger leadership, extra resources and a more coherent structure to protect our borders.\n\nI led Counter Terrorism Policing for over six years. It's a model of close partnership with intelligence agencies, government and multiple partners, all of whom have clear lines of responsibility and accountability for their single mission: to protect lives. It needed to be studied as a model response to this crisis. That's why I am heartened to see Sir Keir Starmer putting forward practical policy proposals to turbocharge the work of the multiple agencies working on this most challenging of issues, and putting serious thought into how you break up the global business model of these evil criminal gangs profiting from human misery.\n\nLabour's New Border Security Command will not only marshall assets already available under the leadership of a new commander, it also provides a direct accountability line to the Home Secretary and enhanced firepower, with hundreds of additional UK investigators, prosecutors and officers deployed to work with their counterparts across Europe and beyond. I do not underestimate the challenge of bringing those resources into alignment and increasing the number of investigators, but it's necessary, and strong leadership can achieve it. I am surprised it has not been considered before.\n\nSir Keir is right to draw parallels between our efforts to combat counter terrorism and the work needed to protect our borders. At its best, the former Office for Security and Counter Terrorism, on which the Border Security Command is based, provided central leadership, a shared set of objectives across agencies, and a strong basis through which to share intelligence and learning. Labour is also setting out new powers to be used by those working in immigration enforcement, which will be vital to both disrupting the gang networks and ensuring we can effectively build cases to increase prosecutions of these criminals. Too many are not facing justice for their appalling actions.\n\nFor Sir Keir's plans to be most effective, the Border Security Commander he appoints will need all the resources promised, control of a dedicated budget, and the freedom to think creatively about how to get the best talent to recruit hundreds more specialist investigators, enforcement officers and specialist prosecutors the Party is committed to fund. It will be essential that all the agencies involved in securing our borders - the NCA, Border Force, intelligence agencies and the police - have the right systems in place to share information and that they are willing to do so.

The prime minister's flagship Rwanda scheme is set to deport the first migrants to Kigali this summer, but has shown no sign of deterring migrants since passing into law.\n\nNow, Labour is planning to divert some of the \u00a375m allocated to the scheme to fund a new Border Security Command, which it says will be modelled on the office for security and counterterrorism.\n\nThe party will also install a new so-called border security commander to work across intelligence agencies to protect the UK's border.\n\nAnd Labour will hire hundreds of intelligence agents and cross-border police officers to support the Border Security Command and tackle smuggling gangs.\n\nAt a speech on the Kent coast, days after the defection of Dover MP Natalie Elphicke, Sir Keir will reiterate Labour's commitment to scrap the beleaguered Rwanda scheme.\n\nThe Labour leader will say: \"Rebuilding our asylum system has become a test of political strength, a trial of leadership to resist the voices who fundamentally do not want to rebuild a functioning asylum system.\n\n\"It's become a question of whether you can prioritise, at all times, the politics of practical solutions, and reject the politics of performative symbols - the gimmicks and gestures.\"\n\nSir Keir will attack the \"rank incompetence\" of the Conservatives on immigration, accusing Mr Sunak of creating a permanent backlog of asylum seekers by refusing to process their claims.\n\n\"Even if they have absolutely no right to be here they cannot be removed, billing the taxpayer for expensive hotel accommodation ... the government has achieved the complete opposite of what they claim,\" he will say.\n\nSir Keir will add: \"A Travelodge amnesty, handed out by the Tory party that, if nothing else, is warmer and safer than spending winter under canvas near a beach in northern France. If you don't think that's what the gangs are telling the people they exploit - you don't know them.\"\n\nAmong the measures set to be proposed by Sir Keir are new border control stop and searches, building on powers created in 2000 by the Terrorism Act, along with new financial investigation powers and search and seizure warrants targeting organised immigration crime.\n\nMeanwhile the new Border Security Command would bring together agencies including the National Crime Agency, Immigration Enforcement and MI5.\n\nSome 8,826 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel so far this year, provisional Home Office figures show.\n\nThis is up 32 per cent on this time last year, when 6,691 migrants were recorded, and a 14 per cent rise compared with the same period in 2022 (7,750).\n\nCampaigners warned that the current asylum system is in \"meltdown\" and is \"only going to get worse\" unless urgent changes are made.\n\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said \"whoever is in government\" must focus on ensuring fairness in the system above anything else, adding: \"The Illegal Migration Act must be scrapped immediately, along with plans to ship people off on a one-way ticket to Rwanda.\n\n\"Instead of wasting time on legislation that bans the right to asylum and dehumanises people who simply need safety, there must be a fair, efficient and humane asylum system.\"\n\nAnd Refugee Action chief executive Tom Naor Hilton said: \"Whoever makes up the next government, they must end this hostile environment and build a refugee protection system that respects people's right to claim asylum, creates safe routes to reach the UK, and tackles the racism that lies at the heart of immigration policy.\"\n\nHome secretary James Cleverly said: \"Rather than starting the flights and stopping the boats, Sir Keir Starmer's big new idea is an amnesty for all illegal immigrants, scrapping our Rwanda plan even if it's working.\n\n\"Nobody believes Keir Starmer wants to control our borders when he previously said immigration controls are 'racist' and blocked the deportation of violent sexual offenders.

It'll be funded using existing resources, as well as \u00a375 million ($94 million) diverted from the governing Conservatives' plan to deport arrivals to Rwanda, he'll say.\n\nThe Tory Rwanda plan amounts to \"sticking plasters; gimmicks not serious government,\" Starmer will say in an attack on the Conservatives' \"talk tough, do nothing culture,\" according to excerpts emailed by his office. He'll speak in the Dover constituency of Natalie Elphicke, who earlier this week defected to Labour from the Tories, taking a swipe at the governing party's record on migration.\n\nLabour's immigration plan is a fresh incursion into territory that's traditionally a Conservative strength, and comes after Starmer also promised to ramp up defense spending and fight the election -- due within nine months -- on the economy. The Labour leader is also seeking to put an end to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's oft-repeated argument that Labour is just \"sniping from the sidelines\" and \"doesn't have a plan.\"\n\nSunak has made \"stopping the boats\" one of his five key pledges to the British electorate, and he's promised to send a first flight of asylum seekers to Rwanda in July. Ministers argue the deterrent effect of the deportations will help stop migrants making the perilous boat journey from France in the first place.\n\nBut while the government has argued the mere threat of the Rwanda plan led to crossings coming down by more than a third last year, they've surged to record levels in 2024, with more than 8,800 people making the journey so far. Starmer has said he'll scrap the Rwanda plan.\n\n\"Let me spell it out again: a scheme that will only remove 1% of small boat crossings a year cannot, and never will be, an effective deterrent,\" Starmer will say. \"It's an insult to anyone's intelligence, and the gangs that run this sick trade are not easily fooled.\"\n\nThe location of the speech is significant -- demonstrating to Starmer's own lawmakers that there's political value in welcoming Elphicke into the party, despite her past criticisms of Labour and right-wing views. Even so, many of his MPs and frontbenchers have expressed unhappiness at her joining the party, not least because of her past support for her ex-husband during his trail for sexual offenses.\n\nStarmer's plan includes:\n\n\"Rebuilding our asylum system has become a test of political strength, a trial of leadership,\" Starmer will say. \"It's become a question of whether you can prioritize, at all times, the politics of practical solutions, and reject the politics of performative symbols -

It processes around 90 percent of the global supply of rare earths into permanent magnets used in everything from wind turbines to electric vehicles and missiles.\n\nFor countries like Australia, Vietnam and Brazil looking to catch up, progress is slow.

It is expected to produce 5,000 tons this year and could double output by 2030, its CEO said.\n\n\"Serra Verde and Brazil have significant competitive advantages that could underpin the development of a globally significant rare earths industry over the long term,\" Serra Verde CEO Thras Moraitis told Reuters.\n\nThose include attractive geology, access to hydropower, established regulations and a skilled workforce, he said.\n\n\"It is still a nascent sector which will require continued support to establish itself in a highly competitive market.

The company also has a preliminary deal to supply rare earth oxides to a separation plant in Estonia run by Toronto-listed Neo Performance Materials.\n\nBrazilian Rare Earths, too, is in the early stages of developing a large rare earths deposit in the country's northeast, backed by Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart.\n\nIts CEO, Bernardo Da Veiga, highlighted Brazil's low operating costs as an advantage over rivals like Australia, where he said a truck driver at an iron ore mine would earn up to A$200,000 ($133,200) a year plus food and accommodation.\n\n\"That same truck driver in Brazil, doing the same job, earns like $15,000 a year and he rides his bike to work and brings his lunch.

It is also looking into rare earths recycling.\n\nAmong companies talking to the government about recycling technology is Australia's Ionic Rare Earths, which has a pilot recycling plant in Belfast and a tie up with Brazilian developer Viridis Mining and Minerals, its CEO Tim Harrison said.\n\nBrazil is also building a magnet factory due to start operating later this year as a proof of concept, Flavio Roscoe, president of Minas Gerais' state Federation of Industries (FIEMG) said.\n\n\"Our objective is to be a developer, a multiplyer of this technology,\" Roscoe said.\n\n\"Brazil has the opportunity to be the world's option to China.\"\n\nPHOTO: Jars containing rare earth minerals produced by Australia's Lynas Corp from its Mount Weld operations are seen near Laverton, northeast of Perth, Australia, August 23, 2019.

It processes around 90% of the global supply of rare earths into permanent magnets used in everything from wind turbines to electric vehicles and missiles.\n\nFor countries like Australia, Vietnam and Brazil looking to catch up, progress is slow. Serra Verde has taken 15 years to get into production. It is expected to produce 5,000 tons this year and could double output by 2030, its CEO said.\n\n\"Serra Verde and Brazil have significant competitive advantages that could underpin the development of a globally significant rare earths industry over the long term,\" Serra Verde CEO Thras Moraitis told Reuters.\n\nThose include attractive geology, access to hydropower, established regulations and a skilled workforce, he said.\n\n\"It is still a nascent sector which will require continued support to establish itself in a highly competitive market.

The company also has a preliminary deal to supply rare earth oxides to a separation plant in Estonia run by Toronto-listed Neo Performance Materials.\n\nBrazilian Rare Earths, too, is in the early stages of developing a large rare earths deposit in the country's northeast, backed by Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart.\n\nIts CEO, Bernardo Da Veiga, highlighted Brazil's low operating costs as an advantage over rivals like Australia, where he said a truck driver at an iron ore mine would earn up to A$200,000 ($133,200) a year plus food and accommodation.\n\n\"That same truck driver in Brazil, doing the same job, earns like $15,000 a year and he rides his bike to work and brings his lunch.

The country's first rare earths mine, Serre Verde, started commercial production this year.\n\nOutput is set to grow, analysts, mining CEOs and investors say, supported by Western government incentives that are also accelerating a global rare earths refining and processing industry.\n\n\"Brazil as a source of potential rare earths is a very exciting proposition because there have been some very meaningful discoveries made in the past couple of years,\" said Daniel Morgan of Barrenjoey investment bank in Sydney.\n\n\"I do think outside of China, Brazil\u00b4s projects are the most economic greenfield projects available.\"\n\nThe U.S. and its allies, almost entirely dependent on China for rare earths metals and magnets, set out to build a separate supply chain by 2027 after deliveries were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic early this decade.\n\nLONG HAUL\n\nChina produced 240,000 metric tons of rare earths last year, more than five times the next biggest producer, the United States, according to U.S. Geological Survey data. It processes around 90% of the global supply of rare earths into permanent magnets used in everything from wind turbines to electric vehicles and missiles.\n\nFor countries like Australia, Vietnam and Brazil looking to catch up, progress is slow. Serra Verde has taken 15 years to get into production. It is expected to produce 5,000 tons this year and could double output by 2030, its CEO said.\n\n\"Serra Verde and Brazil have significant competitive advantages that could underpin the development of a globally significant rare earths industry over the long term,\" Serra Verde CEO Thras Moraitis told Reuters.\n\nThose include attractive geology, access to hydropower, established regulations and a skilled workforce, he said.\n\n\"It is still a nascent sector which will require continued support to establish itself in a highly competitive market. Key processing technologies are controlled by a small number of players,\" he said.\n\nBrazil could have two or three more rare earths mines by 2030, potentially exceeding Australia's current annual output, said Reg Spencer, an analyst at broker Canaccord.\n\nBASEMENT PRICES\n\nOne major obstacle is a 70% slump in rare earths prices over the past two years that has made it difficult for companies to raise funds for mines and processing.\n\n\"Getting money at the moment is tough,\" Nick Holthouse, chief executive of Australian-listed developer Meteoric Resources, told Reuters.\n\nMeteoric is targeting an investment decision in late 2025 for its Caldeira project in Brazil\u00b4s Minas Gerais state which will produce light and heavy rare earths.\n\nIn March, the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) expressed interest in providing Meteoric up to $250 million for the project. The company also has a preliminary deal to supply rare earth oxides to a separation plant in Estonia run by Toronto-listed Neo Performance Materials.\n\nBrazilian Rare Earths, too, is in the early stages of developing a large rare earths deposit in the country's northeast, backed by Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart.\n\nIts CEO, Bernardo Da Veiga, highlighted Brazil's low operating costs as an advantage over rivals like Australia, where he said a truck driver at an iron ore mine would earn up to A$200,000 ($133,200) a year plus food and accommodation.\n\n\"That same truck driver in Brazil, doing the same job, earns like $15,000 a year and he rides his bike to work and brings his lunch. There's just no comparison.\"\n\nCOMPLEXITIES\n\nWhile labour is cheap, developers face technical hurdles. Unlike in China, many Western companies are still perfecting the complex processes for producing rare earth metals, a costly challenge that has stalled projects for years.\n\nTo spur developments, the Brazilian government launched a 1 billion reais ($194.53 million) fund in February to finance strategic minerals projects, including rare earths.\n\nIt also wants to build an industry for transforming these minerals into alloys for batteries, wind turbines and electric motors, the Ministry of Mines and Energy said in a statement.\n\nThe challenge is to stimulate production and build partnerships to promote element separation technologies and supply chain development, the ministry said. It is also looking into rare earths recycling.\n\nAmong companies talking to the government about recycling technology is Australia's Ionic Rare Earths, which has a pilot recycling plant in Belfast and a tie up with Brazilian developer Viridis Mining and Minerals, its CEO Tim Harrison said.\n\nBrazil is also building a magnet factory due to start operating later this year as a proof of concept, Flavio Roscoe, president of Minas Gerais' state Federation of Industries (FIEMG) said.\n\n\"Our objective is to be a developer, a multiplyer of this technology,\" Roscoe said.\n\n\"Brazil has the

The country's first rare earths mine, Serra Verde, started commercial production this year.\n\nOutput is set to grow, analysts, mining CEOs and investors say, supported by Western government incentives that are also accelerating a global rare earths refining and processing industry.\n\n\"Brazil as a source of potential rare earths is a very exciting proposition because there have been some very meaningful discoveries made in the past couple of years,\" said Daniel Morgan of Barrenjoey investment bank in Sydney.\n\n\"I do think outside of China, Brazil's projects are the most economic greenfield projects available.\"\n\nThe US and its allies, almost entirely dependent on China for rare earths metals and magnets, set out to build a separate supply chain by 2027 after deliveries were disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic early this decade.\n\nLong haul\n\nChina produced 240,000 metric tonnes of rare earths last year, more than five times the next biggest producer, the US, according to US geological survey data. It processes about 90% of the global supply of rare earths into permanent magnets used in everything from wind turbines to electric vehicles and missiles.\n\nFor countries like Australia, Vietnam and Brazil looking to catch up, progress is slow. Serra Verde has taken 15 years to get into production. It is expected to produce 5,000 tonnes this year and could double output by 2030, its CEO said.\n\n\"Serra Verde and Brazil have significant competitive advantages that could underpin the development of a globally significant rare earths industry over the long term,\" Serra Verde CEO Thras Moraitis told Reuters.\n\nThose include attractive geology, access to hydropower, established regulations and a skilled workforce, he said.\n\n\"It is still a nascent sector which will require continued support to establish itself in a highly competitive market. Key processing technologies are controlled by a small number of players,\" he said.\n\nBrazil could have two or three more rare earths mines by 2030, potentially exceeding Australia's annual output, said Reg Spencer, an analyst at broker Canaccord.\n\nBasement prices\n\nOne major obstacle is a 70% slump in rare earths prices over the past two years that has made it difficult for companies to raise funds for mines and processing.\n\n\"Getting money at the moment is tough,\" said CEO Nick Holthouse of Australian-listed developer Meteoric Resources.\n\nMeteoric is targeting an investment decision in late 2025 for its Caldeira project in Brazil's Minas Gerais state, which will produce light and heavy rare earths.\n\nIn March, the US Export-Import Bank (EXIM) expressed interest in providing Meteoric up to $250m for the project. The company also has a preliminary deal to supply rare earth oxides to a separation plant in Estonia run by Toronto-listed Neo Performance Materials.\n\nBrazilian Rare Earths, too, is in the early stages of developing a large rare earths deposit in the country's northeast, backed by Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart.\n\nIts CEO, Bernardo Da Veiga, highlighted Brazil's low operating costs as an advantage over rivals like Australia, where he said a truck driver at an iron ore mine would earn up to A$200,000 ($133,200) a year plus food and accommodation.\n\n\"That same truck driver in Brazil, doing the same job, earns like $15,000 a year and he rides his bike to work and brings his lunch. There's just no comparison.\"\n\nComplexities\n\nWhile labour is cheap, developers face technical hurdles. Unlike in China, many Western companies are still perfecting the complex processes for producing rare earth metals, a costly challenge that has stalled projects for years.\n\nTo spur developments, the Brazilian government launched a 1-billion reais ($194.53m) fund in February to finance strategic minerals projects, including rare earths.\n\nIt also wants to build an industry for transforming these minerals into alloys for batteries, wind turbines and electric motors, the ministry of mines and energy said in a statement.\n\nThe challenge is to stimulate production and build partnerships to promote element separation technologies and supply chain development, the ministry said. It is also looking into rare earths recycling.\n\nAmong companies talking to the government about recycling technology is Australia's Ionic Rare Earths, which has a pilot recycling plant in Belfast and a tie up with Brazilian developer Viridis Mining and Minerals, its CEO Tim Harrison said.\n\nBrazil is also building a magnet factory due to start operating later this year as a proof of concept, Flavio Roscoe, president of Minas Gerais' state Federation of Industries said.\n\n\"Our objective is to be a developer, a multiplier of this technology,\" Roscoe said.\n\n\"Brazil has the opportunity to be the world's option to China.\"", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The first involves extracting the rare earths from ores containing other minerals and concentrating them into a mixed rare earth concentrate or carbonate. The second is a more complex stage that separates the rare earths into individual oxide compounds. From there the products are turned into metals used to produce magnets.\n\nLYNAS RARE EARTHS\n\nLynas Rare Earths is the world's biggest supplier of rare earths compounds outside China, from its Mount Weld mine in Australia. It has processing operations in Australia and Malaysia and is building a heavy rare earths processing plant in Texas, with the help of $288 million in U.S. defense funding, expected to come online in fiscal 2026. It will be able to process third-party material.\n\nSOLVAY\n\nBelgian chemicals maker Solvay is expanding rare earths processing at its La Rochelle operations in France, aiming to launch separation and production of rare earth oxides needed for permanent magnet production in 2025. Currently Solvay processes rare earths for other uses, such as for auto catalysts. In March, Solvay signed a memorandum of understanding with French rare earths partner Carester to look at manufacturing opportunities for the permanent magnets supply chain in Europe. It also has an agreement to buy rare earth oxides from recycled material from Canadian clean tech start-up Cyclic Materials.\n\nFrance-based Carester aims to recycle 2,000 metric tons of magnets and separate 5,000 tons of heavy rare earth concentrates from mining per year from 2026.\n\nVACUUMSCHMELZE\n\nGermany's Vacuumschmelze, one of the biggest permanent magnet producers outside of China, has manufacturing operations in Germany, Slovakia, Finland, China and Malaysia. It was bought by U.S. private equity firm Ara Partners in October.\n\nIt was awarded U.S. government funding of $111.6 million to build a neodymium-iron-boron magnet plant in South Carolina. The plant is expected to be finished by late 2025.\n\nThe company has a magnet supply agreement with General Motors and supplies the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nLESS COMMON METALS\n\nUK-based Less Common Metals produces rare earth metals/alloys from its base in northern England and is part of the European Supreemo project to establish a European rare earths value chain.\n\nREETEC\n\nREEtec in Norway, backed by Swedish miner LKAB, is building a commercial rare earth separation plant due to come into production in 2025. It is in discussions with companies to provide concentrate for the plant.\n\nILUKA\n\nAustralian mineral sands producer Iluka Resources is building its Eneabba rare earths refinery in the country's northwest that will process heavy rare earths from its own mines and from third parties like Northern Minerals. Commissioning is expected at the end of 2026. Iluka has been awarded an A$1 billion ($660 million) loan from the Australian government for what will be Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery.\n\nPOSCO, STAR GROUP\n\nSouth Korea's Posco International will provide permanent magnets produced by Star Group to German and U.S. automakers from 2025, sourced from the U.S., Australia and Vietnam. Privately held Star Group is the sole manufacturer of rare earth permanent magnets in South Korea.\n\nJAPAN\n\nJapan has a well developed magnet market that supplies its automotive and high tech industries. Among the biggest producers are Shin-Etsu Chemical, TDK Corp and Proterial.\n\nVTRE\n\nVietnam rare earth processor VTRE, which had partner agreements with Australian rare earth developers Blackstone Minerals and Australian Strategic Materials, suspended production late last year after its chairman was arrested for violating mining regulations.\n\nNEO PERFORMANCE MATERIALS\n\nToronto-listed Neo Performance Materials produces rare earth oxides, magnetic powders and permanent magnets. It has facilities around the world including in China, the U.S., Germany, Canada, Thailand and the UK. It plans to launch a new permanent magnet plant in Estonia next year.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN RESEARCH COUNCIL\n\nCanada's Saskatchewan Research Council received C$31 million ($22.57 million) in government funding to build a rare earths processing plant. It has a supply agreement with Vietnam's Hung Thinh Group (HTG) to import up to 3,000 tons of rare earth carbonate per year for five years beginning in June 2025.\n\nUCORE\n\nCanada's Ucore Rare Metals is building a heavy and light rare earths separation facility in Louisiana set to come online in late 2025.\n\nRAINBOW RARE EARTHS\n\nRainbow Rare Earths, backed by Dublin-based private investment firm TechMet, has begun a rare earth oxide separation process at a K-Technologies facility in Florida for rare earths carbonate that it aims to produce from its Phalaborwa project in South Africa.\n\nMP MATERIALS\n\nMP Materials is building a rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in Texas, helped with $58.5 million in government funding. It currently ships rare earth concentrate to China but expects to be producing finished magnets by late 2025 which it will supply to General Motors. It made a wider than expected loss in the first quarter due to weak rare earths prices.\n\nENERGY FUELS\n\nEnergy Fuels, a U.S. producer of uranium and rare earth elements, said on June 10 it had started to produce commercial quantities of separated rare earths at its Utah operations, where it expects to produce up to 1,000 tons of neodymium-praseodymium a year.\n\nFIEMG\n\nBrazil's state of Minas Gerais Federatio of Industries (FIEMG) is building a proof-of-concept magnet factory set to open in the second half of this year that will have capacity to produce 100 tons of magnets a year when at full capacity.\n\n($1 = 1.3737 Canadian dollars, 1.5147 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne and Fabio Teixeira in Rio De Janeiro.

The first involves extracting the rare earths from ores containing other minerals and concentrating them into a mixed rare earth concentrate or carbonate. The second is a more complex stage that separates the rare earths into individual oxide compounds. From there the products are turned into metals used to produce magnets.\n\nLYNAS RARE EARTHS\n\nLynas Rare Earths is the world's biggest supplier of rare earths compounds outside China, from its Mount Weld mine in Australia. It has processing operations in Australia and Malaysia and is building a heavy rare earths processing plant in Texas, with the help of $288 million in U.S. defense funding, expected to come online in fiscal 2026. It will be able to process third-party material.\n\nSOLVAY\n\nBelgian chemicals maker Solvay (EBR:SOLB) is expanding rare earths processing at its La Rochelle operations in France, aiming to launch separation and production of rare earth oxides needed for permanent magnet production in 2025. Currently Solvay processes rare earths for other uses, such as for auto catalysts. In March, Solvay signed a memorandum of understanding with French rare earths partner Carester to look at manufacturing opportunities for the permanent magnets supply chain in Europe. It also has an agreement to buy rare earth oxides from recycled material from Canadian clean tech start-up Cyclic Materials.\n\nFrance-based Carester aims to recycle 2,000 metric tons of magnets and separate 5,000 tons of heavy rare earth concentrates from mining per year from 2026.\n\nVACUUMSCHMELZE\n\nGermany's Vacuumschmelze, one of the biggest permanent magnet producers outside of China, has manufacturing operations in Germany, Slovakia, Finland, China and Malaysia. It was bought by U.S. private equity firm Ara Partners in October.\n\nIt was awarded U.S. government funding of $111.6 million to build a neodymium-iron-boron magnet plant in South Carolina. The plant is expected to be finished by late 2025.\n\nThe company has a magnet supply agreement with General Motors (NYSE:GM) and supplies the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nLESS COMMON METALS\n\nUK-based Less Common Metals produces rare earth metals/alloys from its base in northern England and is part of the European Supreemo project to establish a European rare earths value chain.\n\nREETEC\n\nREEtec in Norway, backed by Swedish miner LKAB, is building a commercial rare earth separation plant due to come into production in 2025. It is in discussions with companies to provide concentrate for the plant.\n\nILUKA\n\nAustralian mineral sands producer Iluka Resources is building its Eneabba rare earths refinery in the country's northwest that will process heavy rare earths from its own mines and from third parties like Northern Minerals. Commissioning is expected at the end of 2026. Iluka has been awarded an A$1 billion ($660 million) loan from the Australian government for what will be Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery.\n\nPOSCO (NYSE:PKX), STAR GROUP\n\nSouth Korea's Posco International will provide permanent magnets produced by Star Group to German and U.S. automakers from 2025, sourced from the U.S., Australia and Vietnam. Privately held Star Group is the sole manufacturer of rare earth permanent magnets in South Korea.\n\nJAPAN\n\nJapan has a well developed magnet market that supplies its automotive and high tech industries. Among the biggest producers are Shin-Etsu Chemical, TDK (OTC:TTDKY) Corp and Proterial.\n\nVTRE\n\nVietnam rare earth processor VTRE, which had partner agreements with Australian rare earth developers Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Minerals and Australian Strategic Materials, suspended production late last year after its chairman was arrested for violating mining regulations.\n\nNEO PERFORMANCE MATERIALS\n\nToronto-listed Neo Performance Materials produces rare earth oxides, magnetic powders and permanent magnets. It has facilities around the world including in China, the U.S., Germany, Canada, Thailand and the UK. It plans to launch a new permanent magnet plant in Estonia next year.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN RESEARCH COUNCIL\n\nCanada's Saskatchewan Research Council received C$31 million ($22.57 million) in government funding to build a rare earths processing plant. It has a supply agreement with Vietnam's Hung Thinh Group (HTG) to import up to 3,000 tons of rare earth carbonate per year for five years beginning in June 2025.\n\nUCORE\n\nCanada's Ucore Rare Metals is building a heavy and light rare earths separation facility in Louisiana set to come online in late 2025.\n\nRAINBOW RARE EARTHS\n\nRainbow Rare Earths, backed by Dublin-based private investment firm TechMet, has begun a rare earth oxide separation process at a K-Technologies facility in Florida for rare earths carbonate that it aims to produce from its Phalaborwa project in South Africa.\n\nMP MATERIALS\n\nMP Materials is building a rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in Texas, helped with $58.5 million in government funding. It currently ships rare earth concentrate to China but expects to be producing finished magnets by late 2025 which it will supply to General Motors. It made a wider than expected loss in the first quarter due to weak rare earths prices.\n\nENERGY FUELS\n\nEnergy Fuels (TSX:EFR), a U.S. producer of uranium and rare earth elements, said on June 10 it had started to produce commercial quantities of separated rare earths at its Utah operations, where it expects to produce up to 1,000 tons of neodymium-praseodymium a year.\n\nBrazil's state of

The first involves extracting the rare earths from ores containing other minerals and concentrating them into a mixed rare earth concentrate or carbonate. The second is a more complex stage that separates the rare earths into individual oxide compounds. From there the products are turned into metals used to produce magnets.\n\nLynas Rare Earths\n\nLynas Rare Earths is the world's biggest supplier of rare earths compounds outside China, from its Mount Weld mine in Australia. It has processing operations in Australia and Malaysia and is building a heavy rare earths processing plant in Texas, with the help of $288 million in U.S. defense funding, expected to come online in fiscal 2026. It will be able to process third-party material.\n\nSolvay\n\nBelgian chemicals maker Solvay is expanding rare earths processing at its La Rochelle operations in France, aiming to launch separation and production of rare earth oxides needed for permanent magnet production in 2025. Currently Solvay processes rare earths for other uses, such as for auto catalysts. In March, Solvay signed a memorandum of understanding with French rare earths partner Carester to look at manufacturing opportunities for the permanent magnets supply chain in Europe. It also has an agreement to buy rare earth oxides from recycled material from Canadian clean tech start-up Cyclic Materials.\n\nFrance-based Carester aims to recycle 2,000 metric tons of magnets and separate 5,000 tons of heavy rare earth concentrates from mining per year from 2026.\n\nVacuumschmelze\n\nGermany's Vacuumschmelze, one of the biggest permanent magnet producers outside of China, has manufacturing operations in Germany, Slovakia, Finland, China and Malaysia. It was bought by US private equity firm Ara Partners in October.\n\nIt was awarded US government funding of $111.6 million to build a neodymium-iron-boron magnet plant in South Carolina. The plant is expected to be finished by late 2025.\n\nThe company has a magnet supply agreement with General Motors and supplies the US Department of Defense.\n\nLess Common Metals\n\nUK-based Less Common Metals produces rare earth metals/alloys from its base in northern England and is part of the European Supreemo project to establish a European rare earths value chain.\n\nREEtec\n\nREEtec in Norway, backed by Swedish miner LKAB, is building a commercial rare earth separation plant due to come into production in 2025. It is in discussions with companies to provide concentrate for the plant.\n\nIluka\n\nAustralian mineral sands producer Iluka Resources is building its Eneabba rare earths refinery in the country's northwest that will process heavy rare earths from its own mines and from third parties like Northern Minerals. Commissioning is expected at the end of 2026. Iluka has been awarded an A$1 billion ($660 million) loan from the Australian government for what will be Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery.\n\nPosco, Star Group\n\nSouth Korea's Posco International will provide permanent magnets produced by Star Group to German and U.S. automakers from 2025, sourced from the U.S., Australia and Vietnam. Privately held Star Group is the sole manufacturer of rare earth permanent magnets in South Korea.\n\nJapan\n\nJapan has a well developed magnet market that supplies its automotive and high tech industries. Among the biggest producers are Shin-Etsu Chemical, TDK Corp and Proterial.\n\nVTRE\n\nVietnam rare earth processor VTRE, which had partner agreements with Australian rare earth developers Blackstone Minerals and Australian Strategic Materials, suspended production late last year after its chairman was arrested for violating mining regulations.\n\nNeo Performance Materials\n\nToronto-listed Neo Performance Materials produces rare earth oxides, magnetic powders and permanent magnets. It has facilities around the world including in China, the US, Germany, Canada, Thailand and the UK. It plans to launch a new permanent magnet plant in Estonia next year.\n\nSaskatchewan Research Council\n\nCanada's Saskatchewan Research Council received C$31 million ($22.57 million) in government funding to build a rare earths processing plant. It has a supply agreement with Vietnam's Hung Thinh Group (HTG) to import up to 3,000 tons of rare earth carbonate per year for five years beginning in June 2025.\n\nUcore\n\nCanada's Ucore Rare Metals is building a heavy and light rare earths separation facility in Louisiana set to come online in late 2025.\n\nRainbow Rare Earths\n\nRainbow Rare Earths, backed by Dublin-based private investment firm TechMet, has begun a rare earth oxide separation process at a K-Technologies facility in Florida for rare earths carbonate that it aims to produce from its Phalaborwa project in South Africa.\n\nMP Materials\n\nMP Materials is building a rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in Texas, helped with $58.5 million in government funding. It currently ships rare earth concentrate to China but expects to be producing finished magnets by late 2025 which it will supply to General Motors. It made a wider than expected loss in the first quarter due to weak rare earths prices.\n\nEnergy Fuels\n\nEnergy Fuels, a U.S. producer of uranium and rare earth elements, said on June 10 it had started to produce commercial quantities of separated rare earths at its Utah operations, where it expects to produce up to 1,000 tons of neodymium-praseodymium a year.\n\nFIEMG\n\nBrazil's state of Minas Gerais Federation of Industries (FIEMG) is building a proof-of-concept magnet factory set to open in the second half of this year that will have capacity to produce 100 tons of magnets a year when at full capacity.", "source": {"uri": "mining.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MINING.COM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvay_S.A.", "type": "org",

China is the world's largest producer of the materials, while the United States is the second-largest, and Burma, also known as Myanmar, is the third.\n\nThe third-largest reserves of rare earth, though, are in Brazil, which is seeking to leverage its low labor costs, clean energy, established regulations, and proximity to buyers in the United States to build an influential rare earth industry. The country also plans to build Latin America's first magnet plant to produce rare earth metals by the end of this year.\n\nIt's taken 15 years for Serra Verde to start production, with investment and incentives from Western countries. It is expected to produce 5,000 tons this year and could double output by 2030, the company said.\n\n\"Serra Verde and Brazil have significant competitive advantages that could underpin the development of a globally significant rare earth industry over the long term,\" which includes attractive geology, access to hydropower, established regulations, and a skilled workforce, Serra Verde CEO Thras Moraitis said.\n\n\"It is still a nascent sector which will require continued support to establish itself in a highly competitive market. Key processing technologies are controlled by a small number of players,\" he said. Analysts in the industry predicted that Brazil could have two or three more rare earth mines by 2030.\n\nChina produced 240,000 tons of rare earth last year, more than five times the U.S. production, according to U.S. Geological Survey data.\n\nChina also processes about 90 percent of the world's rare earths into permanent magnets, which are used in a range of technological products, from wind turbines to electric cars and missiles.\n\nIn response, the United States, the European Union, and Japan have begun to launch or update national critical mineral supply strategies over the last two years and develop extensive plans to invest in more diversified supply chains to reduce dependence on China.\n\nOn June 18, the U.S. government announced the formation of the Select Committee's Policy Working Group, which will focus on \"countering the Chinese Communist Party's control of critical mineral supply chains.\"\n\nMeanwhile, more countries have joined the race to challenge China's dominance in the field, accelerating rare earth resource exploration and industrial development. A more diversified international supply pattern of rare earth has started to form with the joint efforts of the United States, Australia, Laos, Burma, Africa, and other regions and countries.\n\nIn the past two years, rare earth prices have plummeted by 70 percent.\n\nChina's rare earth industry has been suffering. According to financial data published on April 30, major listed Chinese rare earth companies that made profits last year have seen deficits in the first quarter of this year because of falling rare earth prices and the West's efforts to reduce dependence on China.\n\nHe said Beijing has been trying to use the domination of rare earth resources as a strategic leverage, \"when the relationship with the West is intensified, Beijing deliberately bans exports of it. Then, it certainly affects industrial production and the economy in the West, which has political ramifications. That's why many countries have tried to move away from this red supply chain.\"\n\nSun Kuo-hsiang, a professor of international affairs and business at Nanhua University in Taiwan said Brazil's rare earth production \"has a short-chain effect, which means that they [the West] do not need to go to China to buy rare earths.\n\n\"They can just import rare earths directly from Brazil,\" he told The Epoch Times on June 18. \"So we can see that Brazil's rare earths production plays a role that can replace China amid the current geopolitical competition between Beijing and the West. In other words, if China still tries to use rare earths as a strategic tool for geopolitics and economy, it will no longer be able to do so.\"\n\nHe said that, because nations like Brazil are developing countries, \"if the mining companies in developed countries can invest in them, the results of diversified rare earth development may be achieved more quickly.\"\n\n\"Then, we can see that democratic and free countries can start to avoid the threat of China based on the source of rare earths,\" Mr. Sun added. \"The strategic competition between the United States and China can be more extensive and sustained without being affected by the leverage that China has. It provides the United States with a fundamental basis for this kind of technological competition with Beijing and to carry out strategies like its plans in the Indo-Pacific.\"", "source": {"uri":

However, the slump in rare earths prices is holding back investments and companies are struggling to obtain funding.\n\nNevertheless, Brazilian companies persevered and launched early this year a rare earths production project in the country. The Brazilian government is also looking to support the industry in the hope that Brazil could successfully tap its vast resources and become a top producer of rare earth elements (REE) globally.\n\nHuge Resource, Low Costs\n\nBrazil is estimated to hold 21 million tons of rare-earth-oxide (REO) equivalent, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. That's the third-largest deposits in the world, behind China's 44 million tons and Vietnam's 22 million tons of REO equivalent. By 2023, Brazil's production of rare earth elements was a negligible 80 tons, compared to China's 240,000 tons and the U.S.'s 43,000 tons last year.\n\nRelated: Russia Reclaims Its Position as Europe's Top Gas Supplier\n\nBrazilian and Australian companies, one with U.S. financial support, look to boost production in Brazil in the coming years.\n\nLower costs and clear regulations about mining have helped Brazil attract foreign companies looking to invest in its REE industry.\n\nLocal developers are also looking for a spot in the race to challenge China's dominance in the sector.\n\n\"I do think outside of China, Brazil's projects are the most economic greenfield projects available,\" Daniel Morgan of Barrenjoey investment bank in Sydney has recently told Reuters.\n\nLabor costs in Brazil are much lower than in Australia or the U.S., while the country has decades of experience in regulating a mining industry.\n\nEfforts of the past year yielded results at the beginning of 2024 when Serra Verde began commercial production of Mixed Rare Earth Concentrate from Phase I of its Pela Ema deposit in Mina\u00e7u. Once it has ramped up to full production, Serra Verde is expected to produce at least 5,000 tons per year of rare earth oxide used in the manufacture of high-efficiency permanent magnets required for electric vehicle motors and wind turbine generators.\n\n\"We are now the only company outside Asia to produce at scale all four critical rare earths used in the production of permanent magnets,\" Serra Verde CEO Thras Moraitis said in January.\n\nSerra Verde already has offtake deals with processing companies for a large part of planned production. The project also boasts lower environmental impact - the electricity supply is entirely sourced from renewable sources and the operation is in an established mining district with access to technical skills and developed road and port infrastructure.\n\nLegacy industrial mining regions, skilled and lower-cost workforce, and access to hydropower for operations make Brazil an attractive destination for REE miners.\n\nAustralia's mining magnate and richest woman, Gina Rinehart, is a shareholder in Brazilian Rare Earths, which has just completed a $53-million (AUS$80 million) placement to accelerate exploration and development at the Monte Alto, Sulista, and Pel\u00e9 rare earth projects.\n\nAustralia's Meteoric Resources plans the Caldeira REE project in Brazil, with the goal to begin rare earth production in 2027. The company is in discussions for a $250 million financing from the Export/Import Bank of the United States for the project.\n\nMeteoric Resources CEO Nick Holthouse said in March, when the company announced the potential U.S. financing,\n\n\"In recent years, there has been increased awareness of the deficiencies in the Western Supply chains for Rare Earth mining and downstream processing. Meteoric, through the Caldeira Project and support from the EXIM Bank, intends to play a part in re-building an independent and vertically integrated rare earth supply chain of scale.\"\n\nLong Way to Diversification from China\n\nDespite the upsurge in project plans, financing for investments is not easily available.\n\n\"Getting money at the moment is tough,\" Meteoric's Holthouse told Reuters.\n\nThe recent fall in the price of critical minerals and rare earth elements has affected investments in new supply, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2024 last month.\n\nWhile lower prices for critical minerals in the past year have been good news for consumers and affordability, they have also provided a headwind for new investment, whose growth slowed in 2023 compared to 2022, the IEA noted.\n\n\"Falling prices also make spending to ensure reliable and diversified supply less appealing to investors,\" the agency advocating for a fast energy transition acknowledges.\n\nThe IEA also said that progress in diversifying supply has been limited, with China dominating rare earths production and processing, as it does many other critical minerals.\n\n\"These high levels of supply concentration represent a risk for the speed of energy transitions, as it makes supply chains and routes more vulnerable to disruption, whether from extreme weather, trade disputes or geopolitics,\" IEA said.\n\nBrazil has all the premises to be a major rare earths supplier, but companies planning projects there still need to ensure financing for their ventures.", "source": {"uri": "oilprice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OilPrice.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_element", "type": "wiki",

China's dominance, ASX explorers poised to benefit", "body": "Mining heavyweight Brazil is working hard to overtake China as the world's dominant source of rare earth elements (REE) production and processing.\n\nThe Latin American nation's rare earths mining industry has just started to gain momentum despite having been a major mining destination for decades.\n\nEstablished mining industry regulations and lower labour costs compared to Australia or the US could give it a competitive advantage in the race to quash China's oversized presence in the sector.\n\nThe Brazilian government is looking to support the industry in the hope of tapping its vast REE resources and becoming a top global producer.\n\nLocal developers are also looking for a spot in the race to challenge China.\n\nEarlier this year, the Serra Verde project became Brazil's first integrated ionic absorption clay (IAC) rare earths mine and processing operation to commence production.\n\nControlled by energy transition-focused private equity firm Denham Capital, the project is located in the mid-western state of Goi\u00e1s and has real potential to kickstart the development of a rare earth industry in Brazil.\n\nPhase 1 of the project is expected to output around 5,000 tonnes of rare earth oxides contained in concentrate per annum.\n\nImportantly, this will include the light rare earths neodymium and praseodymium and heavy rare earths dysprosium and terbium, essential to the manufacture of high-performance neodymium iron boron magnets used in electric vehicle (EV) engines and wind turbine generators.\n\nNeodymium and praseodymium are used in the largest amount, but trace quantities of dysprosium and terbium are also critical for maintaining magnet performance at high temperatures within the engine.\n\nAccording to latest figures from the US Geological Survey (USGS), Brazil has the world's third-largest reserves of rare earths at 21 million tonnes.\n\nChina sits in first place with 44Mt followed by Vietnam with 22Mt, with Brazil and Russia sharing third spot.\n\nChina is currently the only country with a fully vertically-integrated supply chain for rare earths magnets and is also the largest consumer of rare earth raw materials.\n\nJapan is the only other nation with a large and highly-developed magnet industry.\n\nThe USGS report showed China produced 240,000 metric tonnes of rare earths last year, more than five times that of the US (the next biggest producer).\n\nIt processed around 90% of the world's rare earths supply into permanent magnets used in everything from wind turbines and EVs to missiles.\n\nThe introduction of Chinese export controls on semiconductor metals gallium and germanium in August raised concerns about security of supply, partly because gallium is an important additive in the high-performance magnets.\n\nDespite Brazil's position on the REE leaderboard, the country produces only a fraction of what it could contribute to the global market.\n\nThe USGS estimates the nation produced just 80t of rare earth raw materials last year out of total global supply of 300,000t.\n\nLow rare earths prices, technical challenges and nervous lenders are believed to pose challenges to Brazil's hopes of propelling itself into the world's top five REE producers.\n\nFor countries such as Australia, Vietnam and Brazil looking to catch up to China, progress is slow.\n\nSerra Verde for example, took 15 years to bring into production and is expected to double its 5,000t annual production by 2030.\n\nBy that time, the country could have two or three more producing rare earths mines, potentially exceeding Australia's current annual output.\n\nThere has been a groundswell in recent times of Australian mining companies entering the Brazilian REE space.\n\nIn May, Aguia announced it was conducting due diligence on an existing processing plant as a lower-cost alternative for the earlier start-up of its phosphate operations located in the State of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nThe company said the plant could be purchased and repurposed to process phosphate ore at a significantly lower capital cost than the $26.2 million estimate in an earlier bankable feasibility study.\n\nThe plant is within trucking distance of the Tres Estrades deposit and nearer to the Mato Grande project.\n\nEarlier this month, Australian Mines reported anomalous REE values in stream sediment samples collected from its Resende lithium project licences in Minas Gerais.\n\nThe best assays returned total rare earth oxides (TREO) grades of 2,893 parts per million and 1,999ppm and early analysis indicated a potential REE assemblage which could contain significant concentrations of magnetic rare earth oxides (MREO) and favourable heavy rare earth elements (HREE).\n\nThe company will complete follow-up mapping and sampling with the aim of confirming the source of the TREO anomalism, its size and economic potential in parallel with advancing exploration over contiguous anomalous tin, tantalum and lithium drainage basins nearby.\n\nDrilling at the newly-discovered Pele\u0301 project this month identified high-grade rare earths-niobium-scandium-uranium mineralisation across large, weathered outcrops 60 kilometres south-west of its Monte Alto project.\n\nThe exploration program returned high-grade REE assays from extensive hard rock outcrop mineralisation at Pele\u0301 Target 1 as well as large-scale geophysical anomalies and high-grade monazite sand mineralisation from shallow auger drill holes.\n\nA total of 61 grab samples returned grades of up to 10.4% TREO, 12,798ppm neodymium-praseodymium, 430ppm dysprosium-terbium, 5,010ppm niobium oxide, 506ppm scandium oxide and 1,035ppm uranium oxide.\n\nThe company is now planning a 5,000m maiden diamond drilling campaign at Pele\u0301 Target 1 to target the mineralisation at depth.\n\nMetallurgical results from the May testing of a 49.6-kilogram bulk sample from the Ema rare earth project revealed \"outstanding\" MREO recoveries averaging 69% neodymium-praseodymium and 48% dysprosium-terbium.\n\nThe results are believed to be some of the highest-ever recorded recoveries from an ionic clay rare earth deposit in Brazil and potentially worldwide.\n\nAdditionally, an inferred mineral resource estimate of 1.02Bt grading 793ppm TREO (including a higher-grade portion of 331Mt at 977ppm TREO) places Ema amongst the largest tonnage fully IAC REE deposits in the world.\n\n\"Ema is a significant rare earth deposit that can be placed on the path towards development and allows [us] to now move ahead full steam with the next phase of our project implementation,\" the company said.\n\nProgress at Ema will be funded by a recent $2m capital raising that issued 87 million shares at $0.023 each to existing institutional investors.\n\nA maiden reverse circulation campaign commenced this month at the Coda project situated in the REE-enriched Patos geological formation in Minas Gerais.\n\nRecent drilling results confirmed the potential for REE-enriched IAC in the northern and southern Coda tenements.\n\nAt Coda North, peak TREO assays of 10,666ppm, 7,943ppm, 7,218ppm, 6,985ppm and 6,459ppm provided guidance for a high-grade exploration target, while the highest intercepts at Coda South were 0.5m at 5,697ppm TREO and 1m at 5,078ppm TREO.\n\nAustralian-based Enova has established a Brazilian exploration team to manage and support in-country operations, with a warehouse facility and office leased in Patos de Minas for sample preparation and storage.\n\nAn expanded field work program at the Campo Grande REE project has discovered new outcropping boulders with the potential to host high-grade hard rock rare earth mineralisation.\n\nThe outcrops were inspected and hard rock grab samples were collected to send to the laboratory for comprehensive assaying.\n\nThe field work follows a recent drilling program at the Rio Negro hard rock REE prospect that makes up a small portion of Equinox' 1,800 sq km landholding.\n\nThe company confirmed that new areas containing high thorium anomalies had been identified over much of the prospect.\n\nThorium is a key pathfinder element for high-grade rare earth mineralisation.\n\nGold Mountain confirmed in early June that preliminary traversing over regional radiometric targets at the Ronaldinho project in the Maracas region of Brazil's Bahia state had identified new thorium anomalies with grades of over 4% TREO.\n\nExtensive areas of potentially-mineralised rock were inferred, as were observations of the thick weathering profile.\n\nFollow-up work in July will include extensive additional traverses in the anomalous region and stream sediment and channel sampling to confirm REE contents of the thorium anomalous area.\n\nAn updated resource estimate at Meteoric's Capa\u0303o do Mel licence in Minas Gerais has doubled the measured and indicated resource of the company's Caldeira project.\n\nThe 147% increase puts the new resource at 85Mt grading 3,034ppm TREO at a 1,000ppm cut-off and includes a high-grade core of 36Mt at 4,345ppm TREO (3,000ppm cut-off) for 19Mt at 5,163ppm TREO (4,000ppm cut-off).\n\nIt increases Caldeira's global resource to 619Mt at 2,538ppm TREO (1,000ppm cut-off) with 23.6% MREO.\n\nThe results highlight Caldeira as one of the highest-grade IAC REE deposits in the world and position Meteoric as a near-term, low-cost supplier of critical minerals.\n\nA maiden drilling campaign has commenced at Perpetual's recently-acquired Raptor REE project, located within the prolific Caldeira complex in Minas Gerais.\n\nThe company will utilise a motorised manually-operated auger rig to a total depth of 20m to obtain data from the deeper saprolite profile where grades are typically significantly higher than surface results.\n\nRaptor covers an area of 3.8 sq km and is located near to Meteoric's Caldeira IAC REE project.\n\nPerpetual said mineralisation in nearby projects has been found in drill depths reaching 8m, indicating shallow subsurface systems.\n\nPatagonia has completed initial ground truth mapping and sampling at 18 granted concessions within Minas Gerais state to test for REE and lithium.\n\nA total of 80 prospective rock and channel soil samples were collected and sent to the laboratory in two batches for testing.\n\nThe campaign is being fast-tracked so the company can sure up drill targets ahead of an aggressive and high-intensity Phase 2 exploration program which will include maiden auger drilling.\n\nPatagonia was granted the concessions in May for a period of three years.\n\nThey sit across 195 sq km of land prospective for lithium pegmatites, REE and IAC.\n\nLast month, Si6 reported the discovery of an extensive pegmatite zone at the Padre Paraiso project within Brazil's famed \"Lithium Valley\" in northeast Minas Gerais.\n\nRecent exploration results also identified the potential for clay-hosted REE mineralisation in the southern portion of the tenement.\n\nOne of the holes from systematic auger drilling returned 9m grading 1,342ppm TREO including 1m at 1,915ppm.\n\nThe proportions of neodymium and praseodymium were reported to be \"encouraging\" and graded up to 405ppm.\n\nIn May, Si6 secured 16 tenements over 300 sq km of northeast Minas Gerais in a joint venture with private company Foxfire Metals.\n\nKnown as the Pimenta project, it contains significant thorium anomalies indicating high prospectivity for IAC and allanite-hosted REE.\n\nFirst assays from Summit's surface pegmatite rock chip sampling at the Equador niobium-REE project have confirmed high-grade niobium and tantalum over a 1.2km strike length in the Borborema pegmatitic province.\n\nSummit acquired the Equador project in April as part of a suite of niobium, REE and lithium assets.\n\nThe company said its critical mineral strategy was founded on the acquisition of several REE and niobium-rich opportunities in a country that hosts approximately 98% of the world's active niobium reserves.\n\nBorborema is reported to be one of the world's most important sources of tantalum, REEs and beryllium.\n\nStep-out auger drilling at the Cupim South deposit within the Colossus IAC REE project area has established multiple zones grading more than 7,000ppm TREO that remain open in all directions.\n\nThe results are located outside the boundary of the maiden Cupim South mineral resource and have confirmed widespread mineralisation across the mining licence.\n\nThe new discoveries demonstrate that the current deposit represents a fraction of the total mineralised system.\n\nA maiden resource estimate announced earlier this month for Colossus sits at 201Mt grading 2,590ppm TREO at a 1,000ppm cut-off.\n\nThe estimate covers only a small portion of total project acreage and is believed to position the company as a premier developer of IAC REEs in the region.", "source": {"uri": "smallcaps.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Small Caps"}, "authors": [{"uri": "imelda_cotton@smallcaps.com.au", "name": "Imelda Cotton", "type":

It shows that the complex hosts 559 million metric tons (MT) of mineralized material at 1.57 percent total rare earth oxides.\n\nThis translates to approximately 8.8 million MT of total rare earth oxides, with an estimated 1.5 million MT of magnet-related rare earths, which are crucial for electric vehicles and wind turbines.\n\nThe discovery positions Norway as a vital player in Europe's rare earths and critical raw materials supply chain.\n\nCurrently, Europe lacks active rare earths extraction, making this find potentially significant in reducing dependency on external sources, notably China, which currently dominates the global rare earths market.\n\nThe deposit is expected to contribute to the European Union's goal of providing for at least 10 percent of its annual rare earths demand by 2030, as outlined in the region's Critical Raw Materials Act.\n\n\"This is a very important moment for Rare Earths Norway, the resource estimate underscores the potential of the deposit to be a truly transformative asset that can underpin a secure rare earths value chain for Europe,\" Alf Reistad, CEO of Rare Earths Norway, said in a company press release. \"We are working with leading partners, such as Montanuniversit\u00e4t Leoben in Austria to develop this deposit with the world's most sustainable mine and mineral processing technology minimizing the environmental footprint from mine to magnet.\"\n\nBernd Sch\u00e4fer, CEO of EIT RawMaterials, a company that supported Rare Earths Norway's work, highlighted the broader implications for the region, commenting, \"This project underscores the potential and the opportunity for Europe to invest in world class mining and processing projects that will help secure our industrial value chains and set new standards in environmental and social performance through technology, innovation and collaboration.\"\n\nMarket watchers view the discovery as a potential game changer for the European rare earths market. Rare earths output from Norway could help stabilize supply chains, reduce prices and foster the growth of green technologies.\n\nRare Earths Norway plans to continue exploration at Fen, with a new drilling campaign set for 2024. It aims to further assess the economic viability of the project through additional studies, with results expected later this year.\n\nThe company also intends to establish a pilot factory in the municipality of Nome to test new technologies and optimize mineral processing. Buoyed by an investment of 20 million Norwegian kroner from Telemark Utviklingsfond, Rare Earths Norway said the pilot will serve as an educational platform for future staff training.\n\nA 10 billion Norwegian kroner investment decision is anticipated by 2030.\n\nDon't forget to follow us @INN_Resource for real-time updates!\n\nSecurities Disclosure: I, Giann Liguid, hold no direct investment

The pressure on these nations to establish strong supply chains is likely to grow when a US tariff on imports of Chinese rare earth magnets begins in 2026.\n\nThe 25 percent tariff, announced by the US government in May 2024, aims to both protect American industries from China's trade practices and support domestic production. One form of magnets the tariffs will affect is sintered neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, crucial for electric vehicle motors and wind turbines.\n\nThis marks the first time rare earth magnets are included in Section 301 tariffs, signaling a significant move in the US-China trade conflict. The initiative is part of broader efforts to bolster US energy and national security.\n\nThis move could be a boon to rare earth mineral and rare earth magnet stocks operating in the space outside of China. To help paint a better picture of the REE landscape, the Investing News Network has compiled a list of the biggest rare earths stocks by market cap on US, Canadian and Australian stock exchanges. Data was gathered on June 12, 2024, using TradingView's stock screener.\n\nUS rare earths stocks\n\nAhead of the Chinese tariffs, the US is striving to secure a stable domestic supply of REEs outside China. The US has vast rare earths reserves and is the second largest global REE producer thanks to its sole operating mine, Mountain Pass. However, it currently lacks sufficient processing facilities. American rare earth companies are working to address this imbalance, presenting investment opportunities for those looking to capitalize on the market's growth potential.\n\nLearn more about MP Materials, Energy Fuels and NioCorp Developments, the three largest US rare earths stocks by market cap, below.\n\nMP Materials, the largest producer of rare earths outside China, focuses on high-purity separated neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) oxide, heavy rare earths concentrate, lanthanum, and cerium oxides and carbonates. The company went public in mid-2020 after acquiring the Mountain Pass mine in California, the only operational US-based rare earths mine and processing facility. In Q3 2023, MP Materials began producing separated NdPr, marking a significant milestone. The company plans to increase rare earth oxide production by 50 percent within four years.\n\nIn April, MP Materials was awarded US$58.5 million to support the construction of the first fully integrated rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in the US. This funding, part of the Section 48C Advanced Energy Project tax credit, was granted by the IRS and Treasury following a selection process that evaluated around 250 projects based on their technical and commercial viability, as well as their environmental and community impact.\n\nLocated in Fort Worth, Texas, the facility will produce the NdFeB magnets crucial for EVs, wind turbines and defense systems. The company is targeting commercial production by late 2025. MP Materials will source raw materials from its Mountain Pass mine, creating an end-to-end supply chain with integrated recycling.\n\nEnergy Fuels is a leading US uranium and rare earths company that operates key uranium production centers including the White Mesa mill in Utah and the Nichols Ranch and Alta Mesa projects in Wyoming and Texas.\n\nThe company finished the construction of Phase 1 REE separation infrastructure at White Mesa in early 2024, and in June it reported the successful commercial production of separated NdPr that meets the specifications required for REE-based alloy manufacturing.\n\nAccording to the company, it is the first US company in decades to achieve commercial-scale, on-spec REE separation from monazite. The Phase 1 REE separation circuit was completed under budget and is now operating at full capacity. Energy Fuels anticipates commercial production of 850 to 1,000 metric tons of NdPr per year.\n\nEnergy Fuels has also made moves to secure sources of monazite sand to process at its White Mesa mill. In 2023, the company acquired the Bahia project in Brazil to potentially supply 3,000 to 10,000 MT of REE-bearing monazite sand annually. Additionally, in early June 2024, Energy Fuels executed a joint venture with Astron (ASX:ATR) for Astron's Donald rare earth and mineral sands project in Victoria, Australia, which Energy Fuels has the option to earn 49 percent of. Donald is expected to begin production as early as 2026 and produce 7,000 to 8,000 metric tons of rare earth concentrate annually, with plans to expand output in subsequent phases.\n\nNioCorp Developments is advancing its Elk Creek project in Nebraska, a leading critical minerals venture featuring North America's highest-grade niobium deposit under development, with significant scandium production capacity. An updated 2022 feasibility study highlighted extended mine life, improved ore grades and enhanced economics for niobium, scandium and titanium.\n\nRecent metallurgical testing has demonstrated the ability to produce high-purity magnetic rare earth oxides at a recovery rate of 92 percent or higher. These results will inform an updated feasibility study, expected in 2024, incorporating rare earth elements into the project's mineral reserves.\n\nIn April the company delisted from the TSX due to significantly lower trading volumes than its NASDAQ listing.\n\nA day later NioCorp announced plans to explore the feasibility of integrating the recycling of permanent rare earth magnets into its proposed Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in southeast Nebraska. An assessment will be undertaken to better understand the technical and commercial viability of recycling post-consumer neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets back into separated rare earth oxides, which can then be utilized in the production of new NdFeB magnets.\n\nThe initial phase of this investigation will involve bench-scale testing, with potential progression to demonstration-scale testing based on results. Notably, this initiative will be conducted independently of NioCorp's ongoing efforts to update its Elk Creek Project Feasibility Study.\n\nAs part of Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, the government has allocated C$3.8 billion in federal funding for opportunities across the critical minerals entire value chain, from exploration to recycling. Rare earth elements are among the minerals listed as critical. Additionally, the government has designated C$7.5 million in funding to support the establishment of a rare earth element processing facility in Saskatchewan.\n\nLearn more about Aclara Resources, Ucore Rare Metals and Mkango Resources, the three largest Canada-listed rare earths stocks focused stocks by market cap.\n\nAclara Resources is advancing its Penco Module project in Chile, characterized by ionic clays abundant in heavy rare earths. Their objective is to generate rare earths concentrate utilizing an environmentally friendly extraction process. This approach aims to eliminate the need for a tailings facility, minimize water consumption and ensure the absence of radioactivity in the final product.\n\nAdditionally, the company discovered its Carina Module project in 2023, and in December disclosed an initial inferred resource for the project, encompassing approximately 168 million MT with a grade of 1,510 parts per million total rare earth oxides and 477 parts per million desorbable rare earth oxides.\n\nAclara successfully concluded its semi-industrial pilot plant program for the Penco Module in September 2023, yielding 107 kilograms of wet high-purity heavy rare earth concentrate from 120 MT of ionic clays.

That discovery followed a vote in Norwegian parliament that paved the way for offshore, deep-sea mining of rare minerals in the country's remote northern waters, Fortune magazine reported, making this the first country in Europe to allow such seabed mining activities.\n\nAt the same time, Critical Metals Corp (NASDAQ:CRML) announced an acquisition deal for what it believes is the largest critical metals deposit in the world, in Greenland.\n\nOn June 10, Critical Metals Corp signed an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in Greenland's Tanbreez project, which it says is the largest rare earth deposit in the world. Once operational, CRML expects it to supply Europe and North America. And on June 18 the company announced it had completed its initial investment for the Tanbreez acquisition, lending more confidence to the deal and further de-risking the transaction, according to a company press release.\n\nTanbreez is said to have over 28 million tonnes of total rare earth oxides, the company estimates internally, and nearly 30% of that is the most coveted \"heavy\" rare earth elements (HREE).\n\nGiven the success of MP Materials (NYSE:MP), a $2.2 billion market cap issuer that has a known resource of just under 3 million tonnes that is almost entirely light rare earth elements (LREE), CRML could be set for a significant valuation re-rate.\n\n\"Tanbreez is a game-changing rare earth mine for the West and a key step in positioning Critical Metals Corp as the leading supplier of critical minerals, CEO Tony Sage said in a press release.\n\nRare earths metals are used in our everyday electronics, but without them, there will be no clean energy transition, and the U.S. will find itself at a weapons disadvantage -- a fearful thought at a time of geopolitical upheaval spreading across Europe and the Middle East.\n\nWith Russia and NATO constantly dipping their toes over their respective \"red lines\" on Ukraine, Russia making flanking movements in northern Africa and the Israel-Hamas conflict causing shifting global alliances and calculations, rare earths metals draw a line in the sand in the next global conflict.\n\nThat makes European discoveries all the more urgent, and Critical Metals is eyeing its potential to become one of the most important miners of the decade. And while heavy critical metals is golden goose in mining today, Critical Metals is also gearing up to develop the Wolfsberg Lithium Project in Austria, Europe's first fully-permitted lithium mine.\n\nChina Is Wielding the Ultimate Weapon, Tanbreez Could be Frontline Defense\n\nThe two-pronged trade war has been well under way for some time now, and it's all about the nexus of microchips and rare earth's elements (REEs).\n\nIn August 2022, the Biden administration signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors and reduce reliance on China. That move was in response to Beijing's move to tighten exports of rare earths elements gallium, germanium and graphite. In late 2023, Beijing tightened controls on exports of rare earths and then banned the export of rare earths extraction technology. The trade war pits semiconductors against REEs in actions and reactions by Beijing and Washington.\n\nEverything going forward is about microchips. Artificial intelligence (AI), military defense, and absolutely everything in between. It's all powered by chips, which do not exist without the REEs necessary to make them.\n\nThat's why the Tanbreez acquisition is so significant. The mine is positioned to become a major REE supply chain for the western hemisphere in the face of a Chinese government that has the ability to severely disrupt the availability of nearly all critical metals.\n\nThe Chinese could almost instantly take 50% of rare earth oxide supply off the market, which would devastatingly affect U.S. defense systems, which are already stretched thin over Ukraine.\n\nTanbreez is a 4.7-billion-tonne Kakortokite outcropping ore body about which over 2,000 academic papers have been written. It contains economically attractive amounts of Zirconium, Tantalum, Niobium, Hafnium and REEs. Nearly 30% of the minerals, all of which are said to occur in significant size and quality, are the most valuable of heavy rare earths.\n\nThe project was awarded an exploitation license on August 13, 2020, and is now working on the final environmental permit before commencing mining operations in Greenland. Nearly 400,000 assays have already been taken from over 400 drill holes. And an SK-1300 is now underway on this 4.7-billion-tonne multi-element asset, which hosts 28.2 million tonnes of total rare earth oxides (TREO).\n\nTanbreez could unlock REE supply for the Western world.\n\nAnd the Western world is growing desperate. The fear is that Beijing has all the leverage in this race. China has already halted exports of some REEs, and since China also processes its own REE raw materials, there is palpable fear that they could cut off the West entirely. That's what makes this a game of chips and rare earths.\n\nIn fact, it was this fear, aired very publicly, that reportedly prompted Donald Trump in 2019 to float the idea among his aides of buying Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, outright. Now, it is in American hands, through the normal channels of corporate acquisitions.\n\nTanbreez could hold the key not only because of its sheer size and scale, but also because an estimated 27.1% of the asset is believed to be comprised of the rarer and more valuable \"heavy\" rare earths elements (HREE). By comparison, other Western miners of REEs have assets with 0.03%-16% of HREE, and a larger percentage of LREEs, light rare earths elements.\n\nLREEs are primarily used in the manufacturing of magnets, which are important components of electric vehicle motors, medical equipment, wind turbines and data storage systems. HREEs, on the other hand, are critical for national defense and vital for heavy weaponry, but are also used in fiber optics, medical equipment and hybrid vehicles.\n\nA single DDG-51 Aegis Destroyer, for instance, requires a phenomenal 5,200 lbs. of REEs, while an F-35 fighter jet requires nearly 600 lbs.\n\nTime is now running out, and Tanbreez could be the best shot at securing this supply chain for national defense.\n\nCritical Metals Corp (NASDAQ:CRML) has what could shape up to be the largest deposit of HREEs in the world, and it already has an exploitation permit, with hundreds of thousands of assays already undergoing testing. From an infrastructure perspective, Tanbreez is also highly advantageous, with year-round direct shipping access through deep-water fjords that feed into the North Atlantic ocean.\n\n\"Everything in your mobile phone, everything in cars comes from these Rare Earth elements. Supercomputers in the future, quantum computing ... The windmills that are up, all the magnets in there. It's all Rare Earths,\" Sage told Oilprice.com in a recent interview.\n\n\"And one thing we don't like to talk about is all the missiles that are being used on the Ukraine war theater and the Israel-Hamas war theater at the moment. They all need to be replenished somehow, and again, that's all Rare Earths. That's why the West is so concerned that China could simply pull the plug,\" Sage added.\n\nThe Lithium Icing on the Rare Earths Cake\n\nCRML's new operation is Tanbreez, but Lithium was its first success. In fact, the company will have the first fully licensed lithium spodumene mine in Europe.\n\nIn Austria, Critical Metal's (NASDAQ:CRML) Wolfsberg Project is positioned in close proximity to large lithium import markets in Europe, such as Germany, Belgium, France, Italy and Spain, and planned battery projects in Hungary, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom, CRML's CEO Tony Sage told Autofutures earlier in June.\n\nThe mine is fully permitted in perpetuity and is positioned to be the next producing lithium mine in the European Union, and the first to produce battery-grade lithium.\n\n\"Substantial exploration and development work has already been conducted by the previous owners including approx. 17,000m of drilling / 1,400m of underground decline, drives and crosscuts. We look forward building upon this foundation and advancing our development plans for this strategic and key asset for Europe's EV supply chain,\" he added.\n\nThe S-K 1300 was updated just last year, indicating a resource of 12.88 million tonnes at 1% Li2O in Zone 1. Critical Metals signed a binding, long-term lithium offtake agreement with BMW Group in December 2022. Wolfsberg is expected to be completed by 2026, with Critical Metals to supply BMW by 2027. Then, in June this year, BMW made a $15-million pre-payment to CMC, which will be repaid through equal setoffs against lithium delivered. European Lithium (ASX: EUR) has also entered into a binding agreement to build the first regional Lithium Hydroxide Refinery in Saudi Arabia, through a JV with Obeikan Investment Group. CMRL expects to benefit from this JV.\n\nThe company's first goal--to become the first local, battery-grade lithium supplier into an integrated European battery supply chain -- was big enough.\n\nIts new goal is to secure one of the largest rare earth's deposits in the world for national defense, and the results of tests on hundreds of thousands of assays could turn out to be a significant response to China in the coming weeks, months, and years.\n\nThe markets don't seem to have realized the full extent of the acquisition and what it means for the West and the company itself. That will probably change over the coming months as the story is only just making its way into the mainstream media.\n\nHere are some other companies in the critical resources space worth following:\n\nBHP Group (NYSE:BHP), a global resources giant, showcases a diversified portfolio encompassing iron ore, copper, coal, nickel, and energy operations.

Brazil may be the answer as the South American mining giant is pushing to challenge Chinese dominance and build its own rare earth industry as the demand for metals needed for magnets used in green energy and defense is rising.\n\nBrazil is seen to take advantage of its low labor costs, clean energy, established regulations, and proximity to end markets such as the United States and Mexico in order to achieve this goal. It is also planning to build Latin America's first magnet plant which would provide a ready buyer for these rare earth metals.\n\nHowever, Reuters noted that this would still be a huge challenge to Brazil, nonetheless. This is because of several factors, including the low prices rare earth minerals have, along with technical challenges and nervous lenders. Still, Brazil wants to become one of the world's top five rare earths producers.\n\nThe country currently holds the world's third-largest rare earth reserves and with the pace of its rare earths projects, experts note that this would be a \"test for how successful the West may be at building a new advanced industry almost from scratch to break China's grip.\"\n\nDespite this, investors are looking at this development very positively, with Daniel Morgan of Barrenjoey Investment Bank in Sydney stating, \"Brazil as a source of potential rare earths is a very exciting proposition because there have been some very meaningful discoveries made in the past couple of years.\"\n\n\"I do think outside of China, Brazil's projects are the most economic greenfield projects available,\" he added.\n\nHowever, this would be a long-haul project as many other countries are looking to catch up to China, including Australia, Vietnam, and Brazil. Continued support would be needed to break Chinese dominance in the industry.\n\nREAD MORE: Guatemala Goods Rejected by China, President Bernardo Arevalo Says It's Because of Country's Support for Taiwan\n\nMeanwhile, Brazil is also looking to stamp down on illegal mining, and it is looking to its French neighbors for help after Lula and French President Emmanuel Macron met on the sidelines of the G7 meetings in Italy.\n\nFrench Guiana is still part of France and much like its larger neighbor, Brazil, it is also rich in minerals. However, also like Brazil, it also has a massive illegal mining problem. This is where the two countries aim to work together and drive out illegal mining.\n\n\"Brazil and France signed an agreement to combat threats to security and the environment, and health risks affecting the cross-border region,\" said the Brazilian government in a statement.\n\nIt is not just Brazil that is challenging China's dominance on rare earth minerals, but also Canada, as the North American country has announced a crackdown against companies selling rare earth minerals mined in Canada but sold to Chinese buyers.\n\nThe crackdown against Chinese rare earth minerals was led by Justin Trudeau himself, and this is leading the Canadian government to buy stockpiled rare earth materials from Vital Metals Ltd. to stop them from selling to a Chinese buyer.\n\nREAD MORE: TikTok

This find is expected to reshape the supply landscape for these critical materials in the region.\n\nRare Earths Norway unveiled a maiden mineral resource estimate for Fen on June 6. It shows that the complex hosts 559 million metric tons (MT) of mineralized material at 1.57 percent total rare earth oxides.\n\nThis translates to approximately 8.8 million MT of total rare earth oxides, with an estimated 1.5 million MT of magnet-related rare earths, which are crucial for electric vehicles and wind turbines.\n\nThe discovery positions Norway as a vital player in Europe's rare earths and critical raw materials supply chain.\n\nCurrently, Europe lacks active rare earths extraction, making this find potentially significant in reducing dependency on external sources, notably China, which currently dominates the global rare earths market.\n\nThe deposit is expected to contribute to the European Union's goal of providing for at least 10 percent of its annual rare earths demand by 2030, as outlined in the region's Critical Raw Materials Act.\n\n\"This is a very important moment for Rare Earths Norway, the resource estimate underscores the potential of the deposit to be a truly transformative asset that can underpin a secure rare earths value chain for Europe,\" Alf Reistad, CEO of Rare Earths Norway, said in a press release. \"We are working with leading partners, such as Montanuniversit\u00e4t Leoben in Austria to develop this deposit with the world's most sustainable mine and mineral processing technology minimizing the environmental footprint from mine to magnet.\"\n\nBernd Sch\u00e4fer, CEO of EIT RawMaterials, a company that supported Rare Earths Norway's work, highlighted the broader implications for the region, commenting, \"This project underscores the potential and the opportunity for Europe to invest in world class mining and processing projects that will help secure our industrial value chains and set new standards in environmental and social performance through technology, innovation and collaboration.\"\n\nMarket watchers view the discovery as a potential game changer for the European rare earths market. Rare earths output from Norway could help stabilize supply chains, reduce prices and foster the growth of green technologies.\n\nRare Earths Norway plans to continue its exploration efforts at Fen, with a new drilling campaign set for 2024. The company aims to further assess the economic viability of the project through additional studies, with results expected later this year.\n\nThe firm also intends to establish a pilot factory in the municipality of Nome to test new technologies and optimize mineral processing. Buoyed by an investment of 20 million Norwegian kroner from Telemark Utviklingsfond, Rare Earths Norway said the pilot will serve as an educational platform for future staff training.\n\nThe exploration and development phases are projected to culminate in a 10 billion Norwegian kroner investment decision by 2030, aiming to cover 10 percent of Europe's rare earths demand.\n\nDon't forget

Several minerals will be crucial for the development of the global renewable energy industry, helping energy companies to produce batteries, solar and wind equipment and clean technologies. To date, the global reliance on China for these minerals has been significant and it continues to dominate worldwide production of lithium and several other critical minerals. However, recent developments could help Europe boost the regional production of critical metals and minerals to strengthen its supply chain and boost energy security during the green transition.\n\nGlobal mining activities are increasing year on year as energy companies and governments invest heavily in the extraction of lithium, cobalt, nickel and other critical minerals to support the green transition. These minerals are needed for renewable energy components, as well as in most of our everyday electronic devices. As the world reduces its coal mining activities, mineral mining is expanding at a rapid pace that is set to continue. The global demand for critical metals and minerals is expected to rise from around 7.5 million tonnes in the 2020s to 28 million tonnes by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nTen countries dominate critical mineral mining, with China, Russia, Chile and the Democratic Republic of Congo at the top. Due to the heavy dependence on critical minerals to drive a global green transition, the EU decided not to stop importing minerals from Russia, despite introducing a ban on oil and gas imports following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, the EU's main source of minerals continues to be China, which supplies around 90 percent of the European mineral market. This is not surprising given that China is responsible for over half of the global processing capacity for lithium, cobalt and manganese.\n\nThierry Breton, EU Commissioner for the internal market, stated, \"Our main concern is excessive dependencies, meaning dependency on a single source of supply.\"\n\nBreton added, \"When we have such dependencies and Russia is at war, or China bans exports, or there is an earthquake in Chile, we can have a problem. \"\n\nFears of an overdependence on a singular power for Europe's mineral supply have driven the EU to look closer to home for its rare earths, to strengthen its supply chain. Europe's mineral mining industry continues to be underdeveloped, but several energy companies are carrying out exploration efforts to assess the potential to develop new mining activities. The EU established its Critical Raw Materials Act with the aim of extracting a minimum of 10 percent of the region's annual critical mineral demand from within Europe by 2030.\n\nNonetheless, there are several constraints to the expansion of mineral mining, such as environmental concerns. As companies dig for minerals to support a green transition, environmentalists are worried that this could cause more harm than good unless done sustainably, leading to stricter regulations on mining in the region.\n\nThis month, the mining company Rare Earths Norway announced it had discovered Europe's largest proven deposit of rare earth metals, which it believes could be key to greater diversification of the minerals supply chain. The firm stated that its Fen Carbonatite Complex in the southeast of Norway is home to 8.8 million metric tonnes of total rare earth oxides (TREOs) with a reasonable prospect for economic extraction. These TREOs are seen as vital to the rapid expansion of renewable energy activities and the development of clean technologies. Rare Earths Norway announced there was an estimated 1.5 million metric tonnes of magnet-related rare earths, which are suitable for use in electric vehicles and wind turbines.\n\nAlf Reistad, the CEO of Rare Earths Norway, said that the discovery is a \"great milestone\" for Rare Earths and added, \"It is important to state that there is absolutely no extraction of rare earth elements in Europe today.\"\n\nNorway is not the only European country aiming to develop its mineral mining industry with Sweden having announced the discovery of rare earths deposits last year. The state-owned company LKAB found that there were rare earths mixed in with the iron ore it was mining in Kiruna, Sweden's northernmost city. Following initial assessments, the firm announced initial estimates of around 1.3 million metric tonnes of rare earths in the mine. However, drilling is slow work with the company suggesting it could take as long as six or seven years to complete exploration. Once complete, production activities can begin so long as the deposits are deemed viable.\n\nThe EU has high hopes for Europe's rare earth metals market, as several countries across the region invest in exploration activities. New discoveries could help the EU to reduce its dependence on China and Russia for its critical minerals, helping it to diversify its supply chain and enhance energy security during the green transition. However, it will likely take a long time to establish production projects, following several years of exploration and analysis.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero

Several minerals will be crucial for the development of the global renewable energy industry, helping energy companies to produce batteries, solar and wind equipment and clean technologies. To date, the global reliance on China for these minerals has been significant and it continues to dominate worldwide production of lithium and several other critical minerals. However, recent developments could help Europe boost the regional production of critical metals and minerals to strengthen its supply chain and boost energy security during the green transition.\n\nGlobal mining activities are increasing year on year as energy companies and governments invest heavily in the extraction of lithium, cobalt, nickel and other critical minerals to support the green transition. These minerals are needed for renewable energy components, as well as in most of our everyday electronic devices. As the world reduces its coal mining activities, mineral mining is expanding at a rapid pace that is set to continue. The global demand for critical metals and minerals is expected to rise from around 7.5 million tonnes in the 2020s to 28 million tonnes by 2040, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nTen countries dominate critical mineral mining, with China, Russia, Chile and the Democratic Republic of Congo at the top. Due to the heavy dependence on critical minerals to drive a global green transition, the EU decided not to stop importing minerals from Russia, despite introducing a ban on oil and gas imports following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, the EU's main source of minerals continues to be China, which supplies around 90 percent of the European mineral market. This is not surprising given that China is responsible for over half of the global processing capacity for lithium, cobalt and manganese.\n\nThierry Breton, EU Commissioner for the internal market, stated, \"Our main concern is excessive dependencies, meaning dependency on a single source of supply.\" Breton added, \"When we have such dependencies and Russia is at war, or China bans exports, or there is an earthquake in Chile, we can have a problem.\n\nFears of an overdependence on a singular power for Europe's mineral supply have driven the EU to look closer to home for its rare earths, to strengthen its supply chain. Europe's mineral mining industry continues to be underdeveloped, but several energy companies are carrying out exploration efforts to assess the potential to develop new mining activities. The EU established its Critical Raw Materials Act with the aim of extracting a minimum of 10 percent of the region's annual critical mineral demand from within Europe by 2030.\n\nNonetheless, there are several constraints to the expansion of mineral mining, such as environmental concerns. As companies dig for minerals to support a green transition, environmentalists are worried that this could cause more harm than good unless done sustainably, leading to stricter regulations on mining in the region.\n\nThis month, the mining company Rare Earths Norway announced it had discovered Europe's largest proven deposit of rare earth metals, which it believes could be key to greater diversification of the minerals supply chain. The firm stated that its Fen Carbonatite Complex in the southeast of Norway is home to 8.8 million metric tonnes of total rare earth oxides (TREOs) with a reasonable prospect for economic extraction. These TREOs are seen as vital to the rapid expansion of renewable energy activities and the development of clean technologies. Rare Earths Norway announced there was an estimated 1.5 million metric tonnes of magnet-related rare earths, which are suitable for use in electric vehicles and wind turbines.\n\nAlf Reistad, the CEO of Rare Earths Norway, said that the discovery is a \"great milestone\" for Rare Earths and added, \"It is important to state that there is absolutely no extraction of rare earth elements in Europe today.\"\n\nNorway is not the only European country aiming to develop its mineral mining industry with Sweden having announced the discovery of rare earths deposits last year. The state-owned company LKAB found that there were rare earths mixed in with the iron ore it was mining in Kiruna, Sweden's northernmost city. Following initial assessments, the firm announced initial estimates of around 1.3 million metric tonnes of rare earths in the mine. However, drilling is slow work with the company suggesting it could take as long as six or seven years to complete exploration. Once complete, production activities can begin so long as the deposits are deemed viable.\n\nThe EU has high hopes for Europe's rare earth metals market, as several countries across the region invest in exploration activities. New discoveries could help the EU to reduce its dependence on China and Russia for its critical minerals, helping it to diversify its supply chain and enhance energy security during the green transition. However, it will likely take a long time to establish production projects, following several years of exploration and analysis.", "source": {"uri": "oilprice.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The launch of commercial production at the Serra Verde mine in Goi\u00e1s is a major milestone. This mine, one of the largest ionic clay rare earth deposits globally, targets an initial annual output of 5,000 tons of rare earth oxides.\n\nThese oxides are vital for manufacturing high-efficiency magnets in wind turbines and electric vehicles. Potential output could double by 2030. Serra Verde is the first large-scale operation outside Asia to produce all four critical REEs essential to manufacturing permanent magnets.\n\n\"Brazil as a source of potential rare earths is a very exciting proposition because there have been some very meaningful discoveries made in the past couple of years,\" Daniel Morgan of Barrenjoey Investment Bank stated for Reuters.\n\nDespite its potential, Brazil's rare earth industry is currently dormant. It produces only a fraction of what it could contribute to the global market. Various challenges, such as environmental concerns and a slow permitting process, contribute to this issue. For example, the aforementioned Serra Verde operation took 15 years to develop.\n\nFurthermore, a recent 70% decline in rare earth prices, accompanied by rising interest rates, has made it challenging for smaller companies to secure funding. These external economic pressures have stalled many projects and deterred potential investors.\n\nStill, positive momentum is building, highlighted by the recent surge in mineral research requests, particularly in Goi\u00e1s. Companies like Appia Rare Earths (OTCQX:APAAF), Aclara Resources (OTCPK: ARAAF), and Brazilian Rare Earths are exploring ionic clay deposits in the region. These deposits share geological similarities with Chinese deposits, a rarity outside of China.\n\nAccompanied by low labor costs, access to hydropower for clean energy, and $194 million in government support for strategic mineral projects, Brazil is on the way to stake its claim in a rapidly developing sector.\n\nNow Read: Snowline Gold's Valley Deposit Emerges As High-Grade Gold Resource In Yukon\n\nBenzinga Mining is the bridge between mining companies and retail investors.

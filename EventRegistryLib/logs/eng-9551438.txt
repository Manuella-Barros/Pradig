He now faces life in prison.\n\nPaduch, who previously worked at New York-Presbyterian's Weill Cornell Medical Center and Northwell Health, was convicted on 11 counts of sexual abuse in Manhattan federal court.\n\nFederal prosecutors indicted Paduch in April of last year, charging him for luring patients to travel across state lines to engage in sexual activity and abusing minors. The prosecutors said that Paduch repeatedly abused male patients between 2007 and 2019, forcing them to masturbate and playing pornography during medical exams.\n\n\"As a unanimous jury has just found, Darius A. Paduch leveraged his position of trust as a medical doctor for his own perverse gratification,\" U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said in a statement. \"For years, patients seeking needed medical care, many of them children, left his office as victims.\"\n\n\"Dr. Darius Paduch has maintained his innocence since the start of this case,\" said Michael Baldassare, a lawyer representing the physician. Baldassare added that he will file an appeal and seek all available relief on behalf of Paduch.\n\nPatients involved in the criminal case against Paduch are just a fraction of those who have alleged sexual abuse by the former physician. Hundreds have accused Paduch of sexual abuse in civil suits, the bulk of which were filed under the Adult Survivors Act, a law in New York that extended the statute of limitations for sexual abuse cases until last November. Many of the cases filed against Paduch also target New York-Presbyterian and Northwell for allowing the abuse.\n\nMallory Allen, a lawyer who represents more than a hundred cases filed by Paduch's former patients, said that her clients feel vindicated by the jury's verdict on Paduch's criminal charges - a decision that they deliberated for just a few hours.\n\n\"The jury spoke loud and clear,\" Allen said. \"This was abuse.\"\n\nThe sentencing hearing for Paduch's case is expected to occur later this summer, Allen said.", "source": {"uri": "crainsnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crain's New York Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_d_ambrosio@crainsnewyork.com", "name": "Amanda D'Ambrosio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwell_Health", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northwell Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Urology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weill_Cornell_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weill Cornell Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Williams_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damian Williams (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masturbation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 33}], "image": "https://s3-prod.crainsnewyork.com/styles/1024x512/s3/0608p2_NY%20Presbyterian%20Weill%20Cornell%20Medical%20Center%20_Buck%20Ennis_i.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551438", "eventUri": "eng-9551438", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

The Department of Justice said at the time that investigators had found Paduch had disguised his abuse as \"medically necessary and appropriate\" treatment.\n\nThe number of known victims quickly expanded after his arrest, with more than 130 former patients coming forward to file civil claims against the disgraced doctor under New York's Adult Survivors Act. The civil cases remain ongoing.\n\nMallory Allen, a partner at Pfau Cochran Vertetis Amala PLLC, a law firm representing the survivors, told The Daily Beast in a statement that justice had been served on Wednesday.\n\n\"For nearly twenty years, patients who trusted him for their medical care and treatment were instead brutalized by his degrading, sexually violating, and medically unfounded acts while the hospitals where he worked looked the other way,\" Allen said.\n\n\"The jury verdict in the criminal case affirms that these heinous acts will not be overlooked, and the pending civil cases will ensure that the institutions who repeatedly prioritized profits over their patients will face consequences for their indifference in ignoring years of complaints.\"\n\nUnder the guise of performing urology examinations between 2015 and 2019, Paduch raped and molested his patients, sodomized them with ungloved fingers and \"other devices,\" masturbated them, and showed them pornography, according to Justice Department prosecutors.\n\nIn one civil lawsuit, which listed at least 58 victims when it was filed last September, but claimed there were \"thousands\" more stemming from Paduch's 19-year career in New York hospitals, the doctor was also accused of forcing patients to undergo surgery without anesthesia and attempting to get them hooked on opioids.\n\n\"Paduch acted as a disgusting, sadistic, and perverted sexual predator,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe bulk of the allegations stem from Paduch's time at two hospitals: NewYork-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and Northwell Health. Both have been accused by plaintiffs of looking the other way as Paduch's abuse was allowed to continue unabated. After Paduch's arrest, both facilities cut ties with him and said they would cooperate with any investigation.\n\nNeither immediately responded to a request for comment on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand juries in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Survivors_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adult Survivors Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weill_Cornell_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weill Cornell Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwell_Health", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northwell Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anesthesia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1715205627/050924-darius-hero_fkavv3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551438", "eventUri": "eng-9551438", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

located in Long Island, where he continued to sexually abuse patients, investigators said.\n\nHe would continually use his position as a urologist at these prominent New York medical institutions to make his patients believe the sexual abuse he inflicted on them was medically necessary and appropriate, and often directed them to schedule follow-up visits, federal prosecutors said.\n\nAs a result, some of the victims attended many appointments with Paduch over the course of multiple years, at which he repeatedly abused them, officials said.\n\nHis lawyer, Michael Baldassare, told the New York Post his client would seek to appeal Wednesday's conviction.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Paduch leveraged his position of trust as a medical doctor for his own perverse gratification,\" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement issued after the unanimous verdict. \"For years, patients seeking needed medical care, many of them children, left his office as victims.\"\n\nA lawyer for Paduch told Newsday that they \"definitely\" planned to appeal, and declined to comment further.\n\nPaduch was indicted last April by a federal grand jury, which charged him with four felony counts related to inducing a victim to engage in unlawful sexual activity. The Department of Justice said at the time that investigators had found Paduch had disguised his abuse as \"medically necessary and appropriate\" treatment.\n\nThe number of known victims quickly expanded after his arrest, with more than 130 former patients coming forward to file civil claims against the disgraced doctor under New York's Adult Survivors Act. The civil cases remain ongoing.\n\nMallory Allen, a partner at Pfau Cochran Vertetis Amala PLLC, a law firm representing the survivors, told The Daily Beast in a statement that justice had been served on Wednesday.\n\n\"For nearly twenty years, patients who trusted him for their medical care and treatment were instead brutalized by his degrading, sexually violating, and medically unfounded acts while the hospitals where he worked looked the other way,\" Allen said.\n\n\"The jury verdict in the criminal case affirms that these heinous acts will not be overlooked, and the pending civil cases will ensure that the institutions who repeatedly prioritized profits over their patients will face consequences for their indifference in ignoring years of complaints.\"\n\nUnder the guise of performing urology examinations between 2015 and 2019, Paduch raped and molested his patients, sodomized them with ungloved fingers and \"other devices,\" masturbated them, and showed them pornography, according to Justice Department prosecutors.\n\nIn one civil lawsuit, which listed at least 58 victims when it was filed last September, but claimed there were \"thousands\" more stemming from Paduch's 19-year career in New York hospitals, the doctor was also accused of forcing patients to undergo surgery without anesthesia and attempting to get them hooked on opioids.\n\n\"Paduch acted as a disgusting, sadistic, and perverted sexual predator,\" the complaint said.\n\nThe bulk of the allegations stem from Paduch's time at two hospitals: NewYork-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center and Northwell Health. Both have been accused by plaintiffs of looking the other way as Paduch's abuse was allowed to continue unabated. After Paduch's arrest, both facilities cut ties with him and said they would cooperate with any investigation.\n\nNeither immediately responded to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

He was found guilty by a jury on eleven federal charges of sexual abuse in all cases.

He declined to comment further.\n\nThe urologist also faces hundreds of lawsuits, which in addition to Paduch name as defendants Northwell or Weill Cornell Medicine -- where court documents state he worked from 2003 to 2019 -- or both health systems. The six victims named in the criminal indictment were abused between 2007 and 2019.\n\nNorthwell and Weill Cornell have declined to comment because of the criminal and civil litigation but have said they are cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nMichael Baldassare, a New Jersey-based defense attorney for Paduch, repeatedly suggested that what he called the \"money lawyers\" in the civil suits -- and the advertisements some ran soliciting alleged Paduch victims as clients -- influenced testimony. He reminded the jury that some ex-patients said they did not view themselves as victims until they learned of the civil suits or heard or saw the ads.\n\nBut in the prosecution's closing statement Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Espinosa said Paduch's victims were vulnerable, coming to him with problems such as erectile dysfunction and male infertility, and he made them believe what he was doing to them was \"treatment.\"\n\n\"They didn't understand what the defendant did to them was abuse at the time, and that's exactly what the defendant was taking advantage of,\" she said.\n\nComplaints about Paduch were made to Northwell, the NYPD and to one victim's parents \"years before there were any 'money lawyers,'\" she said.\n\nEspinosa also pointed to text messages shown during the trial in which Paduch discussed inappropriately touching patients' genitals and wanting to watch them masturbate.\n\n\"All there, in the defendants' own words,\" she said.\n\nOne victim, who used a pseudonym in testimony, testified that a Paduch text about \"practicing\" with him referred to Paduch masturbating him -- which Espinosa said the doctor did to victim after victim, year after year, while \"manipulating them into thinking masturbating them was part of their medical treatment.\"\n\nPaduch also feigned \"prostate exams\" to sexually abuse patients, she said.\n\nAnthony DiPietro, a Manhattan attorney who said he represents 225 alleged Paduch victims in civil cases, including two who were part of the criminal case, said in an interview that the similarity of the testimony of ex-patients who had \"never spoken to each other\" buttressed the prosecutors' case.\n\n\"The idea that they're spontaneously sharing their experiences and it matches up so closely to what everybody else is experiencing shows you this was the M.O. of a serial sexual predator,\" he said.\n\nIn his closing statement Tuesday, Baldassare displayed maps that showed how ex-patients had traveled \"back and forth, and back and forth\" for years, returning to see Paduch even after they had alleged abuse had occurred.\n\nHe also said prosecutors had twisted well-meaning actions by Paduch into \"grooming\" them for sexual abuse.\n\n\"Mentoring can be grooming...,\" Baldassare said. \"Texting, putting someone at ease\" who had erectile dysfunction or other sensitive sexual problems was portrayed as grooming, even if the texts were \"silly, even if they're a little explicit.\"\n\nEspinosa said Paduch's medical degree, his employment by well-respected health systems and his reputation as a leading expert in some of the problems for which patients were seeking help made the doctor think \"he could get away with it.\"\n\nEven if patients concluded that they were being abused, Espinosa said, \"who would take the word of a bunch of young men over a world-famous doctor?\"", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [],

And the day of reckoning is quickly approaching New York Presbyterian, Weill-Cornelland Northwell Health, the institutions that not only knew about this predator's exploitation and abuse of patients, but also helped cover up Paduch's crimes,\" said DiPietro. \"I am extremely proud of our clients for speaking up, in order to help bring down this monster. It is their bravery that brought Paduch to justice - and will ensure that this doesn't happen to other patients of New York Presbyterian, Weill-Cornell and Northwell Health. More patients continue to come forward, and this is only the beginning.\"\n\n\"I went to Dr. Paduch because he was a specialist in a condition that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I have struggled with this all my life and I was desperate to get better,\" said \"James Brent\", a client who testified at the trial. \"I went to Paduch for medical treatment and trusted him as a doctor, but instead of treating me, he made living with this condition into a living nightmare for me.\"\n\nThe DiPietro Law Firm is based in New York and handles cases across the nation involving sexual exploitation and abuse, medical malpractice, and other high-stakes litigation. Attorney Anthony T. DiPietro is a prominent advocate for patient safety who has garnered national recognition for representing both male and female victims and survivors in such cases.DiPietro's accomplishments include landmark settlements against Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, securing over $250 million for patients who were exploited and abused by OB/GYN Robert Hadden, and recently filing a successful restraining order banning Columbia University from engaging in misleading communications with Hadden's former patients, victims, survivors, and putative class members. DiPietro currently represents over 225 former patients of disgraced urologist Darius Paduch. As member of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, Mr. DiPietro is a staunch advocate for legislative reforms designed to protect the rights of victims and survivors exposed to sexual assault and gender-motivated violence.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240509618855/en/\n\nMedia Contact: Sabrina Rezzy,srezzy@nystla.org,610.750.4351\n\nKEYWORD: NEW YORK UNITED STATES NORTH AMERICA\n\nINDUSTRY KEYWORD: PROFESSIONAL SERVICES HEALTH OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES HOSPITALS LEGAL OTHER HEALTH GENERAL HEALTH\n\nSOURCE: The DiPietro Law Firm\n\nCopyright Business Wire 2024.\n\nPUB: 05/09/2024 04:22 PM/DISC: 05/09/2024 04:21 PM\n\nhttp://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240509618855/en", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwell_Health", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northwell Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Urology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Wire", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Wire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewYork-Presbyterian_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronnie Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_malpractice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical malpractice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patient safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presbyterianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multimedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics_and_gynaecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obstetrics and gynaecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/da/bdac805e-c8ec-5f22-b182-459a3007101b/663d5080e5e58.image.jpg?crop=1024%2C538%2C0%2C72&resize=1024%2C538&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551438", "eventUri": "eng-9551438", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

DiPietro said Paduch \"leveraged his position of trust as a medical doctor for his own perverse gratification.\"\n\nHe says that for years, patients seeking medical care, many of them children, left Paduch's office as victims.\n\nThere were seven victims in this federal case, but more than 200 other men claim Paduch abused and violated their bodies and their trust.\n\nDiPietro says red flags were raised as early as 2006.\n\n\"Patients were complaining to New York Presbyterian hospital. Colleagues were complaining about Paduch's misconduct with patients. This had gone on for almost 20 years,\" he said.\n\nPaduch worked at Weil Cornell's Brady Urological institute. Attorney DiPietro says Paduch resigned after multiple complaints, but Weill Cornell allowed him to resign, and he remained a predator.\n\n\"He ended up at Northwell as a result of Weill Cornell not doing their job and reporting him to the authorities like they should have,\" DiPietro said.\n\nWeill Cornell also gave Eyewitness News a statement about Wednesday's conviction, saying they have made changes to policies and training requirements and launched new patient safety programs to prevent this from happening again.\n\nMeanwhile, Northwell has issued a statement saying, in part \"We have been deeply disturbed by the information that has been revealed throughout the course of the criminal proceedings against Dr. Paduch.\"\n\nNorthwell says its cooperating with authorities and can't comment further because of pending litigation.\n\nNorthwell and Paduch's other past employers are named in a state civil case, on behalf of dozens of John Does whose horrific trauma might have been prevented.\n\n\"The institutions who've lied, who've gaslit, who've exposed unsuspecting patients to a known serial predator, the case against these institutions is just getting started,\" DiPietro said.\n\nPaduch's conviction on Wednesday was a federal case because it involved men who were minors at the time of the abuse or traveled across state lines, and the FBI investigated.\n\nTheir attorney says testifying was extremely difficult, some had never told family or friends, but they knew this was necessary to protect others.\n\n\"You have to understand, most of these men have never told anyone what happened to them. They haven't told their spouse, they haven't told their friends,\" DiPietro said. \"And the idea that they're going to get up in a public setting in front of a court, in front of a jury and share what happened to them is so incredibly powerful and I'm so glad they've allowed justice to be served.\"\n\nEyewitness News has reached out to Paduch's attorney Michael Baldassare, who released the following statement:\n\n\"Dr. Darius Paduch has maintained his innocence since the start of this case. He maintains it to this day and we will continue to fight for him. We will be filing post trial motions and an appeal and will seek all available relief.\"\n\nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

BirminghamLive readers branded the incident 'disgusting', while others claimed: 'You're safer leaving your car on a public street.' Shocked motorist James, 57, who was in the city visiting friends, returned to find the carnage at the NCP multi-storey on Newhall Street, in the Jewellery Quarter, on June 5. The A3 saloon had its windows smashed, its console sawn-off and the steering wheel stolen. James shared pictures of the car park's secure entrance appearing to be broken, which meant it was accessible without a QR code. Reacting to the story on Facebook, one reader posted: \"Shameful thieves, so if you work hard you can't afford a car.\" A different person branded the theft: \"Disgusting.\" READ MORE: Audi driver 'shocked' after \u00a340k car looted and left on bricks in 'secure' Birmingham car park Life inside 'car park jungle' where Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital staff 'dump vehicles to avoid fees' Another person wrote: \"This is a supposed to be a pretty secure car park, you can\u2019t just walk in without a ticket, you have to scan your season ticket or day pass to even get in, they would surely know who cannot and what cars left during that time.\" But someone else said: \"It\u2019s not secure at all - anyone can walk in and out.\" A different social media user claimed a Range Rover was stripped last week. He added: \"You're safer dropping car on public street.\" West Midlands Police said it was investigating the theft and have asked for CCTV from the car park \"in an effort to identify the offenders.\" An NCP spokesperson said: \"We take all crime in our car parks very seriously and work hard to try to stop people entering our car parks for reasons other than parking. We are very sorry that this incident occurred whilst the customer was parked on our car park. Unfortunately, crime is an issue that we, and all businesses that have buildings open to the public, are trying to prevent. \"We do try to keep our car parks as secure as possible, but when our security doors are vandalised then we have to go through the processes of repairing, only for them to be vandalised again. We are aware that we are not alone in these concerns, we have met with West Midlands Police, Birmingham Council, the local BID organisations & the Outreach Team regarding anti-social behaviour and vehicle crime on Birmingham car parks. \"We have also had a meeting with BID Manager for the Colmore BID regarding the same issues. On 05 June 2024, we had a meeting with Birmingham City Centre LCSP Group which involved West Midlands Police, Birmingham Council & the BID groups. At this meeting vehicle crime and anti-social behaviour issues were discussed. \"In the next two weeks, we have more meetings booked with the BID groups and with West Midlands Police. We cannot always say we will be able to stop people walking or driving onto our sites with intentions to commit crime, our patrol staff are limited in how much they can apprehend criminals as they are car park operators. \"We have recruited extra staff for our Birmingham sites and have made sure they are covering important shift times to discourage this type of crime and will continue to do all we can from our side to stop this type of crime, alongside the meetings with the relevant people who can help reduce crime in this community.\" Stay up to date with the very latest from your Birmingham or West Midlands street or neighbourhood with our Birmingham News Email Updates sent straight to your inbox", "summary": "An Audi A3 had its windows smashed, console sawn off and steering wheel stolen from an NCP", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/shameful-audi-thieves-strike-secure-29317012", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29315938.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS335744201.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:27:17", "author": "Ben Perrin", "authors": ["Ben Perrin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.333}

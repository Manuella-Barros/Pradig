The Chiefs kicker spoke publicly on Friday for the first time since his controversial commencement speech Benedictine College. \u201cIt\u2019s a decision I\u2019ve consciously made and one I do not regret at all,\u201d Butker said at the Regina Caeli Academy\u2019s Courage Under Fire gala in Nashville. While speaking to Benedictine College graduates, Butker suggested that the women receiving degrees had been told a \u201cdiabolical lie\u201d about entering the workforce and were actually more excited about having a role as a wife and mother than starting a career, referenced Pride Month by arguing against a \u201cdeadly sin sort of pride that has a month dedicated to it,\u201d railed against Joe Biden and his policies as president, condemned abortion and touched on various other cultural and societal topics. The NFL quickly released a statement after Butker\u2019s initial comments, saying the \u201cviews are not those of the NFL as an organization,\u201d and Butker received harsh blowback. \u201cOver the past few days, my beliefs or what people think I believe have been the focus of countless discussions around the globe,\u201d Butker said on Friday. \u201cAt the outset, many people expressed a shocking level of hate. But as the days went on, even those who disagreed with my viewpoints shared their support for my freedom of religion.\u201d Patrick Mahomes defended Butker\u2019s character as a teammate, though he said he did not agree with his comments. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for seven years,\u201d Mahomes said at Chiefs OTA\u2019s. \u201cI judge him by the character he shows every day, and that\u2019s a good person. \u201cWe\u2019re not always going to agree. He said certain things I don\u2019t agree with.\u201d Travis Kelce echoed a similar sentiment. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for seven-plus years, probably eight-plus years, and I cherish him as a teammate,\u201d Kelce said at Chiefs OTA\u2019s. \u201cI think Pat said it best, where he is every bit of a great person and a great teammate, he\u2019s treated friends and family that I\u2019ve introduced to him with nothing but respect and kindness, and that\u2019s how he treats everyone. \u201cWhen it comes down to his views and what he said at [Benedictine College] commencement speech, those are his. I can\u2019t say I agree with the majority of it or just about any of it, outside of just him loving his family and his kids and I don\u2019t think that I should judge him by his views, especially his religious views of how to go about life, that\u2019s just not who I am.\u201d", "summary": "The Chiefs kicker spoke publicly on Friday for the first time since his controversial commencement speech Benedictine College.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/26/sports/harrison-butker-does-not-regret-controversial-speech/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/harrison-butker-commencement-address-2024-82283399_96494b.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 17:03:35", "author": "Jared Schwartz", "authors": ["Jared Schwartz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.114}

They're almost disintegrating,\" Jon Heyman said. \"The Jays are a non-contender. These guys have a year to go, I don't think they're gonna be able to sign them. Negotiations have not gone well, they've not gotten close. No matter what you hear, they've not gotten close to any long-term deal with Bichette or Vlad, so I'm not gonna rule that out at this point. I think it'd probably behoove them to listen closely and consider trades.\"\n\nThe Blue Jays are currently at 41-50 overall, which has them 16 games back of the lead in the American League East, and 9.5 games out of the last Wild Card spot in the American League. Needless to say, it would require a miraculous turnaround for Toronto to get back in the conversation.\n\nEven if Toronto does not trade Guerrero or Bichette, it has other attractive pieces to sell like Yusei Kikuchi and Yimi Garcia. It will be interesting to see the amount of pieces that they sell at the deadline, and if Guerrero and Bichette are involved.\n\nWhere could the Blue Jays send Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette?\n\nThe Blue Jays have Guerrero and Bichette under control through 2025, so they do not have to trade them this year. They could hold onto them and either trade them in the offseason or at next year's deadline, if they want to. However, if Toronto does trade either of the two, Heyman did list some destinations.\n\n\"Bichette, I mean the Dodgers make sense for him,\" Heyman said. \"I think he is a change of scenery guy at this point, I know he hasn't had his typical year. Vlad has performed well this year, not as well as he did in his near MVP year, but I mean he's a that would be sought after. Houston would look at him. Seattle would look at him.\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers would be an interesting landing spot for Bichette, and they could use another infielder with Mookie Betts missing time and Max Muncy possibly missing the rest of the season. It would also provide another option for shortstop for 2025, which could allow Betts to shift back to either second base or the outfield.\n\nThe Houston Astros would be a scary team with Guerrero in the lineup, as they have gotten hot and are not getting much out of the first base position due to the signing of Jose Abreu not working out. The Seattle Mariners could use an impact bat as well, and acquiring Guerrero, beating out the Astros for him, could help them hold onto their lead in the American League West.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_bologna@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ryan Bologna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Bichette", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bo Bichette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusei_Kikuchi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yusei Kikuchi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yimi_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yimi Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Muncy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Muncy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading Cards", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Where-Vladimir-Guerrero-Jr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723114", "eventUri": "eng-9723114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Other times, they have looked like a team that should give up on the current year and look towards next season.\n\nRight now, they are 44-47 and are still very much involved in the National League Wild Card race. They're in a position that could make buying ahead of the trade deadline later this month make sense.\n\nIf they decide to buy, the Giants will be looking for players that can help them win this year and remain with the team for the future. One position that they would like to upgrade is at shortstop.\n\nCBS Sports has linked San Francisco to a shortstop that they have been linked to many times before. Toronto Blue Jays star Bo Bichette was the name that they were connected with.\n\nHere is their reasoning for Bichette being listed as a potential trade candidate ahead of the deadline.\n\n\"It's not so simple to describe this as pure cause and effect -- more goes into a team's fate than the contributions (or lack thereof) from one player -- but Bichette's disappointing season to date helps explain in part why the Blue Jays have underperformed.

Bichette isn't barreling the ball as frequently as he normally does, yet he's a 26-year-old with an established record of being a well-above-average hitter and another season of team control.

However, the talent and potential he has make a potential move make sense for the Giants.\n\nDuring the 2024 season so far, Bichette has played in 76 games. He has hit four home runs to go along with 30 RBI while batting .226/.280/.327.\n\nLooking back at the 2023 season, Bichette showed off the massive potential that he possesses. He slashed .306/.339/.475 and hit 20 home runs while driving in 73 RBI.\n\nIf he is made available by the Blue Jays, San Francisco should absolutely pursue him. He would be a great addition defensively and his long-term potential would be worth the risk for the price the Giants would have to give up.\n\nThere is a good chance that he won't be available, but he's still a name to monitor for the Giants.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Bichette", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bo Bichette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5707,h_3210,x_0,y_312/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/giants_baseball_insider/01j2btdx8ntb9fnv0ks0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723114", "eventUri": "eng-9723114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays are one of the most intriguing teams to watch ahead of the July 30 trade deadline. While it appears likely they will put players with expiring contracts on the market, they appear much more hesitant to move star first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and shortstop Bo Bichette.\n\nThere are two big reasons for this reluctance, according to Mark Feinsand of MLB.com. The Blue Jays have had contract talks with both Guerrero and Bichette, and a source said the gap between the sides in each case is \"much smaller\" than has been reported. That could give Toronto some encouragement that a long-term agreement could be reached with at least one of the two players.\n\nIn addition, one American League executive suggested that the Blue Jays could simply want to run it back with the same core in 2025 despite their struggles in 2024.\n\n\"There's some chance they run it back next year,\" the executive told Feinsand. \"They should be so much better. It has to be extremely frustrating for them.\"\n\nBoth Guerrero and Bichette will become free agents after the 2025 season unless the Blue Jays can sign them to long-term deals. Guerrero has said he would like to re-sign, but Bichette seems more pessimistic about his long-term future with the team.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grey_papke@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Grey Papke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rogers Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Bichette", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bo Bichette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/toronto-blue-jays-logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723114", "eventUri": "eng-9723114", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 270, "textEnd": 277}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-08-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

That would be Toronto Blue Jays shortstop Bo Bichette.\n\nCBS Sports ranked 30 different players who could be on the move before July 30 and identified Bichette as a potential suitor for the Guardians.\n\nThis is why author R.J. Anderson believes Bichette could be on the move before the deadline:\n\n\"We still expect him to be a popular target over the ensuing weeks.

We'll see if the Blue Jays want to tear down their core this summer; if so, Bichette should fetch the biggest return.\"\n\nAs Anderson points out, Bichette is certainly having a down season compared to what we've seen from him in the past. The 26-year-old is hitting .226/.280/.327 with an OPS of .607 in 76 games this year. Perhaps a change of scenery could be what Bichette needs, but there are still concerns in a potential trade for him.\n\nThe Guardians would be acquiring a shortstop for the offensive boost they'd bring to their lineup as Brayan Rocchio has struggled through his first full big league season.\n\nHowever, Rocchio has also emerged as one of the game's best defensive infielders, while playing the field has always been a weak spot for Bichette. Bo has also missed time twice in the last calendar year, including a 10-day injured list stint earlier this season with a calf injury.\n\nThis isn't to say that the Guardians shouldn't trade for Bichette. But Cleveland would be taking a bigger risk with him compared to other trade candidate on the market.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Bichette", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bo Bichette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4821,h_2711,x_0,y_136/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/cleveland_baseball_insider/01j2apdknpp7twffhtgm.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723114", "eventUri": "eng-9723114", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 411, "textEnd": 418}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

With the recent DFA of Nick Ahmed, shortstop is a position of need with Marco Luciano still not ready to play the position at the big league level. One name that has continued to come up is Toronto Blue Jays shortstop Bo Bichette. With the Jays in town, Bichette was asked about his thoughts on a trade and The City.\n\nBichette has had a down year compared to his standards. Over the last three seasons, the 26-year-old has hit at least 20 home runs and collected at least 175 hits, with a combined OPS+ of 124. His season low in batting average over that span was .290.\n\n2024 has been a different story. In 77 games so far, the righty has struggled at the plate. His power is significantly down, with a .322 slugging percentage this season after posting a .475 last year. He's hit just four home runs so far with 16 doubles and 30 RBI. After having a 120 OPS+ last season, it has plummeted to 70. Yet, that's what makes him a trade candidate.\n\nBichette has already had an IL stint in 2024 and even left the game early on Wednesday, which could be playing a part in his poor play. Not only that, but he is a free agent in 2026. With both him and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. needing contracts soon, the team is likely to choose just one.\n\n\"It's a great blend - it's a newer park, but it's got that feel of an older park, which is cool. Honestly, from watching on TV, I did not expect to enjoy it this much. I really like it a lot,\" Bichette told the San Francisco Chronicle when asked about Oracle Park.\n\nWhen asked about a trade, Bichette didn't go into detail.\n\n\"I think it's natural in the situation that my team is in right now to think that's a possibility. But at the end of the day, I have a lot of things myself I need to figure out. That's just my focus right now,\" he said.\n\nThe shortstop naturally kept it vague. But what he did say is that no matter what team he's playing for, it won't change who he is.\n\n\"But, you know, any situation I'm put into, I'm going to continue to go out there and work hard wherever I am. Wherever that is, I'll be happy to do that,\" explained Bichette.\n\nBichette will continue to be the main name linked with the Giants as long as the team has struggles at shortstop. Whether it's the injuries that explain his poor play or if he is a change of scenery candidate, he still makes a lot of sense for a team that has been looking for a star shortstop since missing out on Carlos Correa.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Bichette", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bo Bichette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4735,h_2663,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/giants_baseball_insider/01j2g4jrpgss311y701k.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723114", "eventUri": "eng-9723114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

With the July 30 trade deadline looming, the Dodgers are in a position where they need to make a move to separate themselves from the top teams in the majors.\n\nWhile the Dodgers have been linked to many of the top available targets, the possibility of one popularly discussed trade target being available may not be as certain as it once seemed.\n\nAccording to USA Today's Bob Nightengale, the Dodgers' pursuit of Blue Jays All-Star shortstop Bo Bichette may be unlikely.\n\n\"I don't think they'll trade him. I mean as embarrassing as the seasons been for the Blue Jays, and they're probably the most underachieving team the last few years, you still have Bichette and Guerrero one more year. Bichette, big name, he's done some nice things offensively -- defensively, he's struggled big time. And, let's face it, when the Dodgers are making moves for the World Series, last thing you want is for a young shortstop to kick some balls around come playoff time -- that's where Rojas sticks in. No matter what he does offensively, a guy that is that key, defensively. So I think it's possible, but unlikely. I'm not sure the Blue Jays will even trade them.\"\n\nIt's no secret the Dodgers may need an everyday shortstop, and Bichette would have been a perfect player for a star-studded team like Los Angeles. The Dodgers could always make the call for Bichette, but according to Nightengale, the Blue Jays may seem hesitant to trade arguably their best player.\n\nBichette is not having the best of seasons. He is slashing .223/.276/.322 with a .598 OPS, four home runs, 30 RBI, and 67 hits in 77 games and 301 at-bats. His defense has also slipped a bit this season, so it could be in the Dodgers' best interest that the Blue Jays aren't willing to move on from him with one season of team control left.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Bichette", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bo Bichette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8001,h_4500,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_dodgers/01j2f1gv5c5eabhtzm2x.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723114", "eventUri": "eng-9723114", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 107, "textEnd": 114}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Being that they're 16 games out, Toronto's deficit isn't going away any time soon. Even if the Jays were holding out hope of snagging a Wild Card spot, they have a lot of ground to make up, with a 9.5-game deficit.\n\nYet, another strong case could be made for the Blue Jays to hold onto their All-Stars in hopes of competing next season. However, even that situation is complicated by the fact that the duo are both eligible for free agency in 2026.\n\nAs MLB insider Jon Heyman notes, the Blue Jays are nowhere close to reaching a long-term contract extension with Guerrero. In turn, a trade may be the best option, but only if they receive an offer too good to refuse. Still, if a team did have strong enough interest in pursuing a trade for either player, where would they go? Here's Heyman with more.\n\n\"I don' think Toronto wants to trade Bichette or Vlad, but at this point, they are beyond fading. They're almost disintegrating, the Jays are a non-contender. These guys have a year to go, I don't think they're gonna be able to sign them. The negotiations have not gone well. They have not gotten close, no matter what you hear. They have not gotten close to any long-term deal with Bichette or Vlad. So I'm not going to rule that out at this point. I think it would probably behoove them to listen closely and consider trades. Bichette, I mean the Dodgers make sense for him. Vlad has performed well, he's a guy would be sought-after. Houston would look at him. Seattle would look at him. I would mention Pittsburgh, but you know, Pittsburgh's not that kind of spender.\"\n\nThe Astros have primarily relied on Jon Singleton at first base after moving on from Jose Abreu following a horrific start. Singleton, who's holding steady with an OPS of .699 has provided respectable production, but he's nowhere near the level of player Vlad is, who has an OPS of .821.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dodgers have long been mentioned as a potential trade landing spot for Bichette. Yet, some wonder if the Dodgers would want a better defender starting in their infield.

But with the trade deadline looming at the end of this month, the team is more likely to become a seller as it sits in last place in the AL East and more than eight games out of a playoff spot.\n\nIf the Blue Jays do opt to sell, it seems likely they will look to offload a slew of pending free agents while holding onto blue-chip stars Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette for at least a few more months.\n\n\"The Blue Jays, whose season is already on the brink, plan to place starter Yusei Kikuchi, catcher Danny Jansen, reliever Yimi Garcia, DH Justin Turner and outfielder Kevin Kiermaier on the trade block,\" Bob Nightengale reported for USA Today. \"Yet, they still want to make one last run with Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette. They should be staying until at least this winter, if not next summer.\"\n\nKikuchi, Jansen, Garcia, Turner and Kiermaier are all set to become free agents after this season and collectively represent $44.7 million of payroll. By trading those players and retaining Guerrero and Bichette -- who hold five All-Star appearances between them -- the team might be able to secure some prospective talent to reinforce the roster moving forward or as assets to flip in the offseason.\n\nBichette signed a three-year, $33.6 million extension with the Blue Jays in 2023 and can't become a free agent again until after the '25 season. Guerrero signed a one-year, $19.9 million deal this past offseason and has another year of arbitration ahead before potentially hitting free agency.\n\nOpting to trade away Bichette or Guerrero while they still have another year of team control on their contracts would almost certainly yield a larger return, but the Blue Jays front office has a good reason to retain its best players in hopes of making a playoff run next season. President and CEO Mark Shapiro's contract runs through '25, and general manager Ross Atkins' contract runs through '26.\n\nAs a result, neither executive is likely to prefer an extensive rebuild if there's a chance to reset around Guerrero and Bichette for next season.\n\nRelated: Ideal Blockbuster Trade Partner Emerges for Yankees\n\nRelated: Red Sox Surge Could Spark Trade Reunion With Two-Time All-Star", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_chawaga@postandcourier.com", "name": "Peter Chawaga", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Bichette", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bo Bichette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusei_Kikuchi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yusei Kikuchi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danny Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yimi_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yimi Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kiermaier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Kiermaier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenley_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenley Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Atkins_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ross Atkins (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shapiro_(sports_executive)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Shapiro (sports executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/f5/ff5dc916-8c7b-54d6-9ef4-91325df15a11/668d779c21ea0.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723114", "eventUri": "eng-9723114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Speaking on Wednesday, Heyman indicated that the team could sell off key pieces like Yusei Kikuchi and Chris Bassitt at the trade deadline. While he did say that he didn't think Vladimir Guerrero Jr. or Bo Bichette would be traded, he painted a grim picture there too. Heyman indicated that the team and those players have never gotten close to a contract extension and that he doesn't think that the Jays will be able to sign them before free agency, which comes after the 2025 season.\n\nThat all just leads you to wonder that if the Jays can't re-sign them, perhaps they could trade them in the offseason and try to extract some value out of them heading into the final year of their rookie deals. Heyman said it behoove Toronto to listen to offers on their two stars and that a team like the Dodgers could benefit from Bichette while Houston or Seattle could benefit from landing Guerrero Jr.\n\nHeading into play on Wednesday night, Guerrero Jr. is hitting .291 with 13 homers and 52 RBI.

When does that ever happen???\" X user @SFGiantsGuy_ wrote in part Wednesday.\n\n\"How is one of your star players on another network talking about how he'd love to play for an organization like the Giants?\" they wrote in part.\n\n\"This team keeps finding new, hilarious ways to embarrass itself.\"\n\nWith Major League Baseball's trade deadline scheduled for July 30, Bichette isn't the only Jays player to generate buzz for appearing to toy with the idea of playing for another team.\n\nLast month, star first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. softened his stance on playing for the New York Yankees, a rival team he once swore he'd never play for.\n\n\"Sometimes one says things. It is not that I am trying to take back what I said about the Yankees,\" Guerrero told Virus Deportivo, which ESPN reported on June 25.\n\nGuerrero said he would \"never sign with the Yankees -- not even dead,\" in 2022. He doubled down on those remarks in 2023 when he told the New York Post it was a personal thing with his family.\n\nBut last month, he said \"this is a business,\" ESPN reported.\n\n\"I sat down and spoke with my dad (Vladimir Guerrero Sr.) and my family, and this is a business. And I said I would never again talk about this topic and lots of people have asked me about it.\"\n\nDespite beating the Giants 10-6 Wednesday, it's mostly been a season to forget for the Jays.\n\nA poor win-loss record, a prospect being handed a lengthy suspension just after making his MLB debut, a play by a pitcher that went viral for the wrong reasons, and an epic collapse against the Boston Red Sox are just some of the low points.\n\nThe Jays will look to take the three-game series against the Giants in the rubber match on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Bichette", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bo Bichette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BoBichette.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C772px%2C5569px%2C2942px&resize=720%2C379", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723114", "eventUri": "eng-9723114", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1215, "textEnd": 1222}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 1655, "textEnd": 1662}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

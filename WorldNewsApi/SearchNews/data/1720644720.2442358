Parker and Tulloch fatally stabbed the Zantops and fled with $340 and a list of numbers. They were arrested at an Indiana truck stop weeks later. Tulloch pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and received a mandatory sentence of life without parole, but was later slated for resentencing. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional to sentence juvenile offenders to mandatory life imprisonment without parole. Susanne Zantop, 55, and Half Zantop, 62, were German-born academics. Susanne was head of Dartmouth\u2019s German studies department and Half taught Earth sciences. Veronika Zantop, one of the Zantops\u2019 two daughters, said in an email to The Associated Press in April that she misses her parents and is \u201cdeeply sad for everything they \u2013 and we \u2013 have missed out on.\u201d She also said she wishes Parker \u201cand his family the best and hope that they can heal.\u201d", "summary": "CONCORD, N.H.

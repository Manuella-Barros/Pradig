Last week, the Sonoran Desert hit 125 degrees (51.9 degrees Celsius), the hottest day in Mexican history, according to study co-author Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at Climate Central.\n\nAnd it was even worse at night, which is what made this heat wave so deadly, said Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who coordinates the attribution study team. Climate change made nighttime temperatures 2.9 degrees (1.6 degrees Celsius) warmer and unusual evening heat 200 more times more likely, she said.\n\nThere's just been no cool air at night like people are used to, Salazar P\u00e9rez said. Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\nWATCH: Millions face record-breaking temperatures amid dangerous heat wave\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree (0.5 degrees Celsius) cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline - what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights. For most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nREAD MORE: After catastrophic floods, Vermont becomes first state to enact law requiring oil companies to pay for damage from climate change\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees (43.8 degrees Celsius) on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees (26.7 degrees Celsius) at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 (29.4 degrees Celsius) according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then it moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which may cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed. The night heat is where the inequalities really become apparent because the ability to cool down with central air conditioning depends on how financially comfortable they are, Kenkel said.\n\nAnd that means during this heat wave Salazar P\u00e9rez has been quite uncomfortable.\n\nF\u00e9lix M\u00e1rquez in Veracruz, Mexico and Teresa de Miguel in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "source":

Last week, the Sonoran Desert hit 125 degrees, the hottest day in Mexican history, according to study co-author Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at Climate Central.\n\nIt was even worse at night, which is what made this heat wave so deadly, said Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who coordinates the attribution study team.\n\nClimate change made nighttime temperatures 2.9 degrees warmer and unusual evening heat 200 more times more likely, she said.\n\nThere's just been no cool air at night like people are used to, Salazar P\u00e9rez said. Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline -- what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights.\n\nFor most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which could cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel

She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights. For most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees (43.8 degrees Celsius) on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees (26.7 degrees Celsius) at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 (29.4 degrees Celsius) according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nRelated Story: Brace Yourselves. Triple-Digit Heat Is Heading Back Here.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then it moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which may cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed. The night heat is where the inequalities really become apparent because the ability to cool down with central air conditioning depends on how financially comfortable they are, Kenkel said.\n\nAnd that

Last week, the Sonoran Desert hit 125 degrees, the hottest day in Mexican history, according to study co-author Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at Climate Central.\n\nIt was even worse at night, which is what made this heat wave so deadly, said Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who coordinates the attribution study team.\n\nClimate change made nighttime temperatures 2.9 degrees warmer and unusual evening heat 200 more times more likely, she said.\n\nThere's just been no cool air at night like people are used to, Salazar P\u00e9rez said. Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline -- what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights.\n\nFor most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which could cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed.\n\nExtreme heat drives up food prices.

Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree (0.5 degrees Celsius) cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline - what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights. For most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6, the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\n(MORE: When We Could See Some Heat Wave Relief)\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high-pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then it moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which may cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed. The night heat is where the inequalities really become apparent because the ability to cool down with central air conditioning depends on how financially comfortable they are, Kenkel said.\n\nAnd that means during this heat wave Salazar P\u00e9rez has been quite uncomfortable.", "source": {"uri": "weather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Weather Channel"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Last week, the Sonoran Desert hit 125 degrees (51.9 degrees Celsius), the hottest day in Mexican history, according to study co-author Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at Climate Central.\n\nAnd it was even worse at night, which is what made this heat wave so deadly, said Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who coordinates the attribution study team. Climate change made nighttime temperatures 2.9 degrees (1.6 degrees Celsius) warmer and unusual evening heat 200 more times more likely, she said.\n\nThere's just been no cool air at night like people are used to, Salazar P\u00e9rez said. Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree (0.5 degrees Celsius) cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline - what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights. For most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees (43.8 degrees Celsius) on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees (26.7 degrees Celsius) at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 (29.4 degrees Celsius) according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then it moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which may cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed. The night heat is where the inequalities really become apparent because the ability to cool down with central air conditioning depends on how financially comfortable they are, Kenkel said.\n\nAnd that means during this heat wave Salazar P\u00e9rez has been quite uncomfortable.\n\n___\n\nF\u00e9lix M\u00e1rquez in Veracruz, Mexico and Teresa de Miguel in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nRead more of AP's climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Last week, the Sonoran Desert hit 125 degrees (51.9 degrees Celsius), the hottest day in Mexican history, according to study co-author Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at Climate Central.\n\nAnd it was even worse at night, which is what made this heat wave so deadly, said Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who coordinates the attribution study team. Climate change made nighttime temperatures 2.9 degrees (1.6 degrees Celsius) warmer and unusual evening heat 200 more times more likely, she said.\n\nThere's just been no cool air at night like people are used to, Salazar P\u00e9rez said. Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree (0.5 degrees Celsius) cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline - what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights. For most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees (43.8 degrees Celsius) on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees (26.7 degrees Celsius) at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 (29.4 degrees Celsius) according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then it moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which may cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed. The night heat is where the inequalities really become apparent because the ability to cool down with central air conditioning depends on how financially comfortable they are, Kenkel said.\n\nAnd that means during this heat wave Salazar P\u00e9rez has been quite uncomfortable.\n\n___\n\nF\u00e9lix M\u00e1rquez in Veracruz, Mexico and Teresa de Miguel in Mexico City contributed to this

She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights. For most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees (43.8 degrees Celsius) on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees (26.7 degrees Celsius) at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 (29.4 degrees Celsius) according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then it moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which may cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed. The night heat is where the inequalities really become apparent because the ability to cool down with central air conditioning depends on how financially comfortable they are, Kenkel said.\n\nAnd that means during this heat wave Salazar P\u00e9rez has been quite uncomfortable.\n\nF\u00e9lix M\u00e1rquez in Veracruz, Mexico and Teresa de Miguel in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n\nRead more of AP's climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Last week, the Sonoran Desert hit 125 degrees (51.9 degrees Celsius), the hottest day in Mexican history, according to study co-author Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at Climate Central.\n\nAnd it was even worse at night, which is what made this heat wave so deadly, said Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who coordinates the attribution study team. Climate change made nighttime temperatures 2.9 degrees (1.6 degrees Celsius) warmer and unusual evening heat 200 times more likely, she said.\n\nThere's just been no cool air at night like people are used to, Salazar P\u00e9rez said. Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense, it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said.

Last week, the Sonoran Desert hit 125 degrees, the hottest day in Mexican history, according to study co-author Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at Climate Central.\n\nAnd it was even worse at night, which is what made this heat wave so deadly, said Imperial College of London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who coordinates the attribution study team. Climate change made nighttime temperatures 2.9 degrees warmer and unusual evening heat 200 more times more likely, she said.\n\nThere's just been no cool air at night like people are used to, Salazar P\u00e9rez said. Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists - and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement - refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline - what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights. For most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6, the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what's happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and headed to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which may cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed. The night heat is where the inequalities really become apparent because the ability to cool down with central air conditioning depends on how financially comfortable they are, Kenkel said.\n\nAnd that means during this heat wave, Salazar P\u00e9rez has been quite uncomfortable.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which could cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed.\n\nExtreme heat drives up food prices.

Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline -- what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights.\n\nFor most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which could cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed.\n\nExtreme heat drives up food prices.

Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press.\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline -- what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights.\n\nFor most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which could cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed.\n\nExtreme heat drives up food prices.

Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline -- what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights.\n\nFor most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which could cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed.\n\nExtreme heat drives up food prices.

Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline -- what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights.\n\nFor most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which could cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed.\n\nExtreme heat drives up food prices.

Last week, the Sonoran Desert hit 125 degrees (51.9 degrees Celsius), the hottest day in Mexican history, according to study co-author Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at Climate Central.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Climate change made nighttime temperatures 2.9 degrees (1.6 degrees Celsius) warmer and unusual evening heat 200 more times more likely, she said.\n\nThere's just been no cool air at night like people are used to, Salazar P\u00e9rez said. Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree (0.5 degrees Celsius) cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline - what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights. For most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees (43.8 degrees Celsius) on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees (26.7 degrees Celsius) at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 (29.4 degrees Celsius) according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then it moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which may cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed. The night heat is where the inequalities really become apparent because the ability to cool down with central air conditioning depends on how financially comfortable they are, Kenkel said.\n\nAnd that means during this heat wave Salazar P\u00e9rez has been quite uncomfortable.\n\nF\u00e9lix M\u00e1rquez in Veracruz, Mexico and Teresa de Miguel in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n\nRead more of AP's climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline -- what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights.\n\nFor most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which could cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed.\n\nExtreme heat drives up food prices.

Doctors say cooler night temperatures are key to surviving a heat wave.\n\nAt least 125 people have died so far, according to the World Weather Attribution team.\n\n\"This is clearly related to climate change, the level of intensity that we are seeing, these risks,\" said study co-author Karina Izquierdo, a Mexico City-based urban advisor for the Red Cross and Red Crescent Climate Centre.\n\nThe alarming part about this heat wave, which technically is still cooking the North American continent, is that it's no longer that out of the ordinary anymore, Otto said. Past studies by the group have looked at heat so extreme that they found it impossible without climate change, but this heat wave not so much.\n\n\"From a sort of weather perspective in that sense it wasn't rare, but the impacts were actually really bad,\" Otto told The Associated Press.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"The changes we have seen in the last 20 years, which feels like just yesterday, are so strong,\" Otto said. Her study found that this heat wave is now four times more likely to happen now than it was in the year 2000 when it was nearly a degree cooler than now. \"It seems sort of far away and a different world.\"\n\nWhile other groups of international scientists -- and the global carbon emissions reduction target adopted by countries in the 2015 Paris climate agreement -- refer to warming since pre-industrial time in mid 1800s, Otto said comparing what's happening now to the year 2000 is more striking.\n\n\"We're looking at a shifting baseline -- what was once extreme but rare is becoming increasingly common,\" said University of Southern California Marine Studies Chair Carly Kenkel, who wasn't part of the attribution team's study. She said the analysis is \"the logical conclusion based on the data.\"\n\nThe study looked at a large swath of the continent, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize and Honduras and the hottest five consecutive days and hottest five consecutive nights.\n\nFor most of the area, those five days ran from June 3 to 7 and those five nights were June 5 to 9, but in a few places the peak heat started May 26, Otto said.\n\nFor example, San Angelo, Texas, hit a record 111 degrees on June 4. Between June 2 and June 6 the night temperature never dipped below 80 degrees at Corpus Christi airport, a record each night, with two days when the thermometer never dropped below 85 according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBetween June 1 and June 15, more than 1,200 daytime high temperature records were tied or broken in the United States and nearly 1,800 nighttime high temperature records were reached, according to the National Center for Environmental Information.\n\nThe attribution team used both current and past temperature measurements, contrasting what is happening to what occurred in past heat waves. They then used the scientifically accepted technique of comparing simulations of a fictional world without human-caused climate change to current reality to come up with how much global warming factored into the 2024 heat wave.\n\nThe immediate meteorological cause was a high pressure system parked over central Mexico that blocked cooling storms and clouds, then moved to the U.S. Southwest and is now bringing the heat to the U.S. East, Winkley said. Tropical Storm Alberto formed Wednesday and is heading to northern Mexico and southern Texas with some rains, which could cause flooding.\n\nMexico and other places have been dealing for months with drought, water shortages and brutal heat. Monkeys have been dropping from trees in Mexico from the warmth.\n\nThis heat wave \"exacerbates existing inequalities\" between rich and poor in the Americas, Izquierdo said, and Kenkel agreed.\n\nExtreme heat drives up food prices.

The organization was contacted for comment.\n\nThis heat wave was significantly intensified by humans burning fossil fuels, a recent study has revealed.\n\nAccording to the World Weather Attribution, a collection of scientists that run rapid and non-peer reviewed climate attribution studies, soaring daytime and nighttime temperatures were made 35 times more likely and 2.5 degrees hotter due to the warming effects of burning fossil fuels. They calculated in the study, which measured temperatures recorded between June 3 and 9 and was released on Thursday, that not only is this extreme heat more intense but it is already much more frequent.\n\nImperial College London climate scientist Friederike Otto, who coordinated the attribution study team, said that the deadliness of this heat wave has been largely down to it failing to cool down at night, a crucial component for being able to survive boiling days.\n\nAccording to Otto, climate change has made nighttime temperatures 2.9 degrees warmer and unusual evening heat 200 times more likely.\n\nOtto told Newsweek: \"We need to stop burning fossil fuels, we need to stop fighting stupid culture wars on the back of the poor, uneducated and most vulnerable.\"\n\nShe added: \"Cities need to have heat action plans that inform people about the dangers of heat, provide public spaces that are accessible where people can rest in the cool, public water fountains and a long-term strategy to increase the green space and decrease concrete in cities.\"\n\nIn New York City, which is also experiencing a heat wave, the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation has been preparing ways to keep New Yorkers cool.\n\nPress Officer Gregg McQueen, from the department, told Newsweek: \"We have 850 spray showers in parks and 3,400 drinking fountains.\n\n\"On a hot summer day, shaded areas can be 20-45 degrees lower than unshaded areas. [the Department of Parks & Recreation] is on track to plant a record 18,000 trees this year -- the most since 2016.\"\n\nIn Veracruz, Mexico, Margarita Salazar P\u00e9rez, 82, told the Associated Press how she has been struggling to cope without air conditioning as temperatures climb, especially since it has remained so hot at night.\n\n\"It's an oven here; you can't stay here,\" she said.\n\nCitizens have even witnessed monkeys falling from trees in Mexico as the heat has become too oppressive even for them.\n\nWhile this extreme weather event is still ongoing, the study has highlighted that such occurrences are becoming disturbingly common. Otto noted that heat waves, once rare and exceptional, are now frequent and severe, reflecting significant climatic shifts over the past two decades.\n\nThe study examined temperature records across a vast region, including southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and several Central American countries. Findings showed record-breaking temperatures, with San Angelo, Texas, reaching 111 degrees, and Corpus Christi experiencing unprecedentedly warm nights.\n\nUsing a combination of current and historical temperature data, the research compared scenarios with and without human-induced climate change, revealing the unmistakable influence of global warming on this year's heat wave.\n\nProfessor Otto told Newsweek: \"Given that this heat, particularly the U.S. part of it, was not a rare event it is quite likely that this was not the last heat wave this summer. It means more people will die.\"\n\nThe immediate cause of this specific heat wave was a high-pressure system over central Mexico, which stifled cooling storms and clouds before shifting to the U.S. Southwest. Tropical Storm Alberto, which recently formed, is expected to bring rain to northern Mexico and southern Texas, potentially leading to floods.\n\nThe heat wave has also exacerbated existing socio-economic inequalities, with poorer communities suffering the most due to limited access to cooling facilities. This disparity highlights the broader implications of climate change on vulnerable populations.\n\nThe study emphasized that future warming will bring more frequent and intense events, stressing the need for comprehensive heat safety protection laws, strengthened grid resilience, and improved urban planning to mitigate the effects on the most vulnerable populations.\n\nOtto gave her advice for people experiencing heat waves this year. \"Drinking lots of water is key,\" she said. \"Look after elderly and ill people living alone. Dousing with water is also an option. Open windows at night but have them closed during the day.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_clark@newsweek.com", "name":

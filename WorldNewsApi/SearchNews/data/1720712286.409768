Speaking with the The Indian Express, a state police personnel who escorted the body to the Boxanagar community health centre said the deceased was found along with some sacks of sugar on the Indian side of the border. Later, a BSF Public Relations Officer (PRO) informed that jawans were conducting an area domination march near the Kalamchoura Border Out Post (BOP) around 7:30 am when they spotted a large group of smugglers, armed with sharp-edged weapons on either side of the border fence. \u201c\u2026 (they were) attempting to smuggle goods across the international border. When asked to stop, the smugglers didn\u2019t pay heed and got aggressive. They tried to encircle a BSF jawan with the intent to assault him and snatch his weapon. Sensing imminent danger\u2026 the BSF jawan fired one round of Pump Action Gun (PAG) in self-defence,\u201d the PRO claimed. He, however, said the BSF jawan named Rajeev Kumar was unsuccessful in thwarting the smugglers by using the non-lethal weapon. \u201cAfter a brief scuffle, the BSF constable\u2026 was compelled to fire one round from his service INSAS rifle. Resultantly, one Bangladeshi smuggler was killed close to the border fence and about 150 yards inside the Indian territory,\u201d the BSF official added. Subsequently, a thorough search was carried out and a huge quantity of sugar, four machetes, and wooden planks were seized from the spot. The deceased was identified as Anwar Hussain, 35, a resident of Mirpur in Bangladesh\u2019s Comilla district. Earlier this month, a similar incident was reported in the same area. The BSF claimed that the same group of Bangladeshi smugglers involved in Sunday\u2019s attack had brutally assaulted a BSF constable and attempted to drag him towards the Bangladesh side. The miscreants had snatched the constable\u2019s weapon (PAG) and radio set.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bangladeshi-smuggler-shot-dead-bsf-jawan-tripura-9381666/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/BSF.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:23:48", "author": "Debraj Deb", "authors": ["Debraj Deb"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.595}

It's not yet known if the Lord of the Rings actor sustained injuries from the accident.\n\nMcKellen, 85, was performing a fight scene when he lost balance and fell off the stage, according to BBC. McKellen plays John Falstaff in the play, which is made up of Shakespeare's Henry IV, Parts One and Two. McKellen was reportedly circling the fight scene involving two other players when he fell off the stage. The house lights came up and McKellen reportedly called out for help. The evening performance was canceled and the audience was evacuated from the theater.\n\nAn audience member told BBC that, \"As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance.\" They said the moment was \"very shocking.\"\n\nPlayer Kings opened in April in the West End and is set for a 12-week run. In addition to McKellen, the cast includes Ted Lasso's Toheeb Jimoh and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina's Richard Coyle, seen above with McKellen on stage during an early performance.\n\nRelatedRory Kinnear to Play Tom Bombadil in 'The Rings of Power' Season 2\n\nMcKellen has many Shakespeare plays on his resume, one of the more recent credits being a production of King Lear in 2018. A performance once had to be canceled after McKellen injured his leg during a fall as he tried to catch a train. He participated in an audience Q&A instead of performing the show that day for the sake of the audience.\n\nMcKellen is best known for playing Gandalf in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, as well as playing Magneto in the X-Men franchise and his prolific stage career. He's a two-time Oscar nominee, having received his first nomination for Best Actor in 1999's Gods and Monsters and his second for Best Supporting Actor in 2002's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. He's a five-time Emmy nominee.\n\nMore Headlines:\n\nWhy Isn't 'America's Got Talent' New This Week?Ian McKellen Will Make 'Full Recovery' After Falling Off Stage During Performance in West End'Wheel

On Monday, the 85-year-old actor fell off the stage during a performance at the No\u00ebl Coward theater in London -- but now says that he's in \"good spirits\" and plans to return to the show.\n\nMcKellen is currently starring as the rotund and bombastic Jon Falstaff in Player Kings, a production of William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Parts One and Two, directed by Robert Icke. According to BBC journalist Aleks Phillips, the Lord of the Rings actor fell off the front of the stage during a fight scene between Falstaff, the Prince of Wales, and Henry IV. Per Phillips, the accident happened after McKellen seemingly lost his footing.\n\n\"It happened so quickly that at first it appeared to be part of the performance,\" wrote Phillips. \"But the actor cried out and staff rushed to help.\"\n\nAfter McKellen's fall, the octogenarian was rushed to the hospital, and the audience left the theater. The following night's performance of Player Kings was subsequently cancelled. According to a statement by the producers, McKellen received a scan from doctors at Britain's National Health Service who said that the actor would \"make a speedy and full recovery.\" A spokesperson for the theatre said that \"Ian is in good spirits,\" and is expected to return to performances for the Wednesday matinee.\n\nOver the course of his illustrious six-decade acting career, McKellen has been nominated for two Academy Awards, five BAFTA awards, and has won a Tony, a Golden Globe and six Olivier Awards. He is perhaps best known for portraying Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Hobbit films, as well as Magneto in the original X-Men films. In recent years, McKellen has been a fixture on the London stage, starring as King Lear and an elderly Hamlet, a role he's set to reprise in a new film adaptation directed by Sean Mathias.", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vanityfair.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falstaff_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Falstaff (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Icke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Icke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Olivier Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Mathias", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Mathias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hobbit (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gandalf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_Film_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Academy Film Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamlet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Lear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Screen Actors Guild Awards", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/667193d8593d5c63436ec15a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/1988737513?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

I think it's the work he loves the most. Here he is at a tender 85 years young, starring in Player Kings, an adaptation of Henry IV Parts 1 & 2 by Shakespeare. He's playing John Falstaff, a character he says he'd avoided until now, despite routinely treading the boards in Shakespearean roles. The play began its three-month run in April, with closing just around the corner on June 22. Unfortunately, McKellen suffered an accident at Monday's show, falling off the stage and into the audience. He was immediately hospitalized, and the goods news is he's expected to make a swift and complete recovery:\n\nIan McKellen is on the road to recovery after falling off stage mid-performance in London on Monday, June 17.\n\nThe actor, 85, was hospitalized after losing his footing during a fight scene in Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre, according to BBC News. The producers of the play told PEOPLE in a statement that the Lord of the Rings star has undergone a scan and is expected to make a \"full recovery\" following the fall.\n\n\"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings,\" the statement began. \"Following a scan, the brilliant NHS [National Health Service] team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\"\n\n\"The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday 18 June so Ian can rest,\" the statement continued. \"Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow. Thank you to doctors Rachel and Lee who were on hand in the audience and to all the venue staff for their support.\"\n\nMcKellen later thanked everyone for their \"kind messages and support\" following the accident.\n\n\"Since the accident, during a performance of Player Kings last night, my injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service,\" he said in a statement to Variety. \"To them, of course, I am hugely indebted. They have assured me that my recovery will be complete and speedy and I am looking forward to returning to work.\"\n\nThe audience was evacuated by theater staff following the incident, per BBC News. The outlet reported that McKellen, who plays the character of John Falstaff in the play, fell off the front of the stage and cried out in pain as crew members rushed to help.\n\nAudience member Charlie Johnson told ITV News, \"There were strobe lights and then it all went dark, at which point you could see the silhouette of Sir Ian come out from the wings. And the way the stage works at the Noel Coward is there's sort of a step down just as the stage meets the audience.\"\n\n'I think what happened was he put his foot too far, sort of went off that initial step, at which point he lost his balance and pretty much just went head first into the audience,\" he added. \"And within seconds a blood-curdling scream arose from the actor. He was clearly in a lot of pain, he was screaming, 'Help me.'\"\n\nA source told PEOPLE that the English actor was \"fine\" immediately after the scare.\n\nIt's hoped the star, who is best known for playing Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy and Magneto in the X-Men films, will return to the stage on Wednesday, 19 June, for a matinee performance, per ITV.\n\n[From People]\n\nOof, the descriptions of the scream Ian let out gave me chills. He's a fairly spritely fellow -- I remember his Mr. Holmes costar Laura Linney commenting on a talk show about how insanely fit and energetic he was, but of course I'm not finding it now on the interwebs, and this was nearly 10 years ago. But still, any fall as an octogenarian has to be treated seriously. Ian wasn't at the Wednesday performance; instead the show was canceled with a similar statement that they hoped he could return on June 20. Without any disrespect to Sir Ian, is there not an understudy for him so that the show can, you know, go on?

It's not yet known if the Lord of the Rings actor sustained injuries from the accident.\n\nMcKellen, 85, was performing a fight scene when he lost balance and fell off the stage, according to BBC. McKellen plays John Falstaff in the play, which is made up of Shakespeare's Henry IV, Parts One and Two. McKellen was reportedly circling the fight scene involving two other players when he fell off the stage. The house lights came up and McKellen reportedly called out for help.

He participated in an audience Q&A instead of performing the show that day for the sake of the audience.\n\nMcKellen is best known for playing Gandalf in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, as well as playing Magneto in the X-Men franchise and his prolific stage career. He's a two-time Oscar nominee, having received his first nomination for Best Actor in 1999's Gods and Monsters and his second for Best Supporting Actor in 2002's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.

Sir Ian is expected to next appear in Wednesday's matinee performance of the production.\n\nAfter the accident, audience members were informed that the remainder of the evening performance had been cancelled and they were evacuated from the premises. A BBC journalist, who saw the play, said the veteran stage and screen actor was in a scene involving the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy when he fell off the front of the stage.\n\nThe actor was heard to cry out in pain as staff rushed to help. Audience member Paul Critchley told PA it was a \"shock\" to witness the fall.\n\nMr Critchley, a Methodist minister from Downham Market, said: \"Sir Ian seemed to trip as he moved downstage to take a more active part in the scene. He picked up momentum as he moved downstage which resulted in him falling off the stage directly in front of the audience.\n\n\"The house lights came up very quickly as the stage management and front of house team dealt with the incident. We were evacuated immediately so that Sir Ian could be treated in privacy. An announcement was made by theatre management that the show had been cancelled, that Sir Ian was receiving treatment and an ambulance had been called.\n\n\"It was a shock to witness his fall and I wish him a speedy recovery. My thoughts are also with his fellow cast members, stage crew and front of house team at the Noel Coward Theatre.\"\n\nLondon Ambulance Service has declined to comment.

The BBC was the first to report.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what injuries, if any, McKellen sustained in the fall. However, the theater was evacuated and the production was canceled for the evening.\n\nPlayer Kings is an adaptation of Parts 1 and 2 of Henry IV, with McKellen in the leading role as John Falstaff. His run on the show has been received with universal critical acclaim.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the incident occurred as McKellen's Falstaff was circling a battle involving his co-lead, Toheeb Jimoh (playing Henry Percy), and he fell off the front of the stage and cried out for help.\n\nET spoke to Veronika Muzika, who was an audience member during the incident. Muzika said she at first thought McKellen's accident was part of the play.\n\n\"So he fell down the orchestra pit just in front of our eyes and he was screaming something like, 'Help,' and I thought it was part of the play because there were a lot of wounded people, like, you know, it's a war act, and yeah, it was quite shocking,\" she says. \"He seemed like he was moving pretty OK through the stage as normal. I didn't see any kind of tripping. Maybe there was some slippery sort of fabric or something and it must have been something really, really small because he was acting and walking naturally until the last step when he actually fell and that's why I thought it was staged.\"\n\nCharlie Johnson, who was also in attendance at the event, took to X (formerly Twitter) to detail what he had seen.\n\n\"Just witnessed Ian Mckellan severely injure himself after falling off stage at Noel Coward Theatre. Sir Ian could be heard screaming in pain as ushers rushed to his aid,\" he wrote. \"Show cancelled as he is treated by ambulance crews. Wish him all the best.\"\n\nET spoke with Johnson via video chat on Tuesday, and he detailed his experience at the performance.\n\n\"I was in the front row. I was probably about three or four meters from where Sir Ian fell off,\" Johnson shared, explaining that the fall happened \"during a battle scene -- so there were lights going on and off and it was quite dark.\"\n\n\"So I'm not sure if he slipped on a prop or he overstepped slightly and lost his balance,\" he continued. \"What I did see was Sir Ian pretty much diving head first into the audience and actually landed, from what I saw, on one of the members of the audience, and within seconds, you could hear Sir Ian screaming.\"\n\n\"He was shouting, 'Help me! Help me!' And the lights all went on and the curtain was drawn and within another five, ten seconds the ushers came over, members of the cast were looking to see if he was OK,\" Johnson recalled. \"As time went on, within a minute really, the whole of the auditorium was evacuated, so that Sir Ian could be treated with a bit of privacy.\"\n\n\"It was really frightening,\" Johnson said. \"I never really heard someone scream like that in pain, other than on the rugby pitch after someone smacked their wrist in half, so I immediately feared the worst -- especially because Sir Ian is 85 years old and a fall like that can be really bad for someone at that age.\"\n\nThe production team behind Player Kings tells ET of McKellen's on-stage fall at the No\u00ebl Coward theatre, \"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance.\"\n\n\"Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits,\" the statement continued. \"The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday 18 June so Ian can rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow. Thank you to doctors Rachel and Lee who were on hand in the audience and to all the venue staff for their support.\"\n\nThe production is scheduled to tour a series of London theaters through July 27.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toheeb_Jimoh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toheeb Jimoh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Falstaff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Falstaff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Percy_(Hotspur)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Percy (Hotspur)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falstaff_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falstaff (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestra_pit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orchestra pit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditorium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auditorium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Venues", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Venues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-06/Ian_McKellen_GettyImages-2147987313_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 3930, "textEnd": 3937}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 4234, "textEnd": 4241}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

A horrified audience member reportedly said he heard Sir Ian crying out: \"Help me, help me\" after the fall.\n\nThe actor then said 'My arms, my arms' and 'Help me, help me' again.

Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, began its 12-week West End run in April. On Tuesday morning, an eyewitness, Charlie Johnson, spoke to Good Morning Britain about the shock fall.\n\nHe explained: \"As we approached the interval of the play, there was a fight scene going on and there were strobe light and then it all went dark, at which point you could see the silhouette of Sir Ian come out the wings and the way the stage works at the Noel Coward, there's a step-down and where the stage meets the audience.\n\nCharlie said to Susanna Reid : \"I think what happened is he took his foot too far off that initial step and lost his balance and went head first into the audience. Within seconds, a blood curling stream arose from the actor and he was clearly in a lot of pain and screaming 'help me.'\"\n\nAudience members took to X, formerly known as Twitter after the incident to share their concern for the legendary actor as they described it as a \"really bad fall\".\n\nOne user shared: \"Audience shocked by Sir Ian McKellen's fall off stage tonight at Noel Coward Theatre. Staff working hard to help him. Thoughts with him, cast and crew.\" Someone else replied: \"It was a really bad fall. I hope that he is OK.\" Another added: \"Shocking to watch, it was a terrible fall. Hoping he is not badly injured, he seemed to be in great pain.\"\n\nAnother audience member shared: \"Wasn't sure if it was part of the play. He sounded in a bad way. Hope he's ok.\" While another echoed: \"It was very shocking indeed. Praying he is OK.\"\n\nIn the role of John Falstaff, Sir Ian was involved in a battle scene with the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy when he fell off the front of the stage. As the house lights came up, the actor cried out in pain and staff rushed to his aid. The Mirror has contacted Ian's representatives for comment.\n\nAfter the accident, audience members were informed that the remainder of the evening performance had been cancelled and they were evacuated from the premises. A BBC journalist, who saw the play, said the veteran stage and screen actor was in a scene involving the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy when he fell off the front of the stage. The actor was heard crying out in pain as staff rushed to help.\n\nAudience member Paul Critchley said it was a \"shock\" to witness the fall. Mr Critchley, a Methodist minister from Downham Market, Norfolk, said: \"Sir Ian seemed to trip as he moved downstage to take a more active part in the scene. He picked up momentum as he moved downstage which resulted in him falling off the stage directly in front of the audience.\n\n\"The house lights came up very quickly as the stage management and front of house team dealt with the incident. We were evacuated immediately so that Sir Ian could be treated in privacy. An announcement was made by theatre management that the show had been cancelled, that Sir Ian was receiving treatment and an ambulance had been called.\n\n\"It was a shock to witness his fall and I wish him a speedy recovery. My thoughts are also with his fellow cast members, stage crew and front of house team at the Noel Coward Theatre.\"\n\nLondon Ambulance Service has declined to comment.\n\nPlayer Kings, adapted and directed by Robert Icke, is due to move to the Bristol Hippodrome in July and will also be staged in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.\n\nLord Of The Rings icon Sir Ian had recently split from his boyfriend following a year-long romance. He fell for Oscar Conlon-Morrey, 30, when they worked together in a pantomime back in December 2022. In the show, Sir Ian played Mother Goose while Oscar, who is 54 years his junior, portrayed his son Jack.\n\nOscar was quick to tell the world of his joyous new relationship on New Year's Eve in 2023 when he gushed over his romance with the acting legend. \"I saw in 2023 at the house of the new love of my life,\" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nAccording to insiders at the time of their relationship announcement, Ian was also smitten with the young actor. However, their relationship ended in February with the pair calling it quits on their whirlwind romance.\n\nIan's close friends have always doubted that the legendary actor would ever settle down. At the beginning of Ian and Oscar's romance, one well-known actor opened up about the doubts he harboured about Ian's relationship.\n\n\"Oscar has been telling friends and family of his big plans with McKellen. He's even said he thinks they'll get engaged,\" the unnamed actor told Mail Online at the time. \"McKellen hasn't had a boyfriend in 20 years. He is really not a marriage man.\n\n\"He doesn't want a man living in his home. He enjoys having someone when he is on tour. He gets infatuated; then as quickly as he is into them, he's fallen out with them. There is no way when he is out of the bubble of doing this panto that he is going to have this guy with him in East London, rattling around,\" he added.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The Lord Of The Rings actor, 85, who is currently playing John Falstaff in a production of Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre, was in a fight scene when he lost his footing and fell from the stage during Monday evening's performance.\n\n\"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings,\" a spokesperson for the London theatre said in a statement to the PA news agency. \"Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\n\n\"The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday June 18 so Ian can rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow.\"\n\nThe statement also thanked doctors Rachel and Lee who were \"on hand in the audience\" and to the venue staff \"for their support\". Sir Ian is expected to next appear in Wednesday's matinee performance of the production.\n\nAfter the accident, audience members were informed that the remainder of the evening performance had been cancelled and they were evacuated from the premises. A BBC journalist, who saw the play, said the veteran stage and screen actor was in a scene involving the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy when he fell off the front of the stage.\n\nThe actor was heard to cry out in pain as staff rushed to help. Audience member Paul Critchley told PA it was a \"shock\" to witness the fall.\n\nMr Critchley, a Methodist minister from Downham Market, Norfolk, said: \"Sir Ian seemed to trip as he moved downstage to take a more active part in the scene. \"He picked up momentum as he moved downstage which resulted in him falling off the stage directly in front of the audience.\n\n\"The house lights came up very quickly as the stage management and front of house team dealt with the incident. We were evacuated immediately so that Sir Ian could be treated in privacy. \"An announcement was made by theatre management that the show had been cancelled, that Sir Ian was receiving treatment and an ambulance had been called.\n\n\"It was a shock to witness his fall and I wish him a speedy recovery.

The X-Men and The Lord of the Rings star had been performing in the West End production of the play Player Kings on Monday when he reportedly fell off the front of the stage during a fight sequence. The play was halted and the audience evacuated while McKellen was attended to, with the star eventually being hospitalized. The rest of Monday's Player Kings performances were canceled for the day. As for the rest of McKellen's scheduled appearances, those will no longer be happening.\n\nPlayer Kings announced on Thursday morning that David Semark will replace Ian McKellen as Sir John Falstaff in the final three performances, while McKellen recovers from his fall. On the bright side, McKellen is scheduled to return to the Players Kings national tour in Bristol on July 3rd.\n\n\"David Semark will be playing the role of Sir John Falstaff for the final three scheduled performances of Player Kings at the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre in London while Ian McKellen recuperates following his fall on Monday 17 June,\" the statement reads. \"We look forward to Ian returning to the production, which begins a national tour in Bristol on Wednesday 3 July, before visiting Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.\"\n\nIan McKellen comments on stage performance fall\n\nOn Tuesday, Sir Ian McKellen took to social media to confirm that he is being treated for injuries sustained from his fall during a performance in Player Kings and that he will make a \"complete and speedy\" recovery.\n\n\"I want to thank everyone for their kind messages and support,\" McKellen's post on X (formerly Twitter) reads. \"Since the accident, during a performance of Player Kings last night, my injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service. To them, of course, I am hugely indebted. They have assured me that my recovery will be complete and speedy and I am looking forward to returning to work. @dobbsCLD\"\n\nIs Ian McKellen Retiring?\n\nIn recent years, some have speculated that the 85-year-old McKellen will eventually retire, after already having a decades-long career on both the stage and screen. In a 2023 interview, McKellen flat-out debunked the possibility, arguing that he wants to \"carry on\" in the industry while he is still healthy and able to.\n\n\"Retire to do what?\" McKellen said at the time. \"I've never been out of work, but I'm aware that any minute now something could happen to me which could prevent me from ever working again. But while the knees hold up and the memory remains intact, why shouldn't I carry on? I really feel I'm quite good at this acting thing now.\"\n\nWill Ian McKellen Return to Lord of the Rings?\n\nEarlier this year, it was confirmed that a new Lord of the Rings movie is in the works, titled Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum. With Andy Serkis confirmed to direct and reprise his role as Gollum, speculation has swirled over whether or not some of the other Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit cast members would return for the movie as well. When asked about the possibility of reprising his role as Gandalf, McKellen indicated that he would if he's still \"alive.\"\n\n\"But here is no script, there is no offer, there is no plan.\" McKellen added.\n\nPhoto credit Joe Maher/WireImage via Getty", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Falstaff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Falstaff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West End theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gandalf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hobbit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Busking_and_Street_Performing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Busking and Street Performing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/06/20/63100199-d212-4721-91bc-93adfc306614/ian-mckellen-national-tv-awards-2023-getty.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 1193, "textEnd": 1200}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 965, "textEnd": 973, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The play will begin its tour July 3 and perform at Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.\n\nEarlier this week, McKellen said in a statement shared with The Times that he is \"looking forward to returning to work.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\n(L.A.

My thoughts are also with his fellow cast members, stage crew and front of house team at the Noel Coward Theatre.\" London Ambulance Service has declined to comment.\n\nPlayer Kings, a production of Henry IV, parts one and two, adapted and directed by Robert Icke, is due to move to the Bristol Hippodrome in July and will also be staged in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle. Sir Ian's career has spanned more than six decades and seen the actor perform at theatres around the country.\n\nOn screen he is most known for playing Magneto in the X-Men films and Gandalf in Peter Jackson's fantasy trilogy, based on the books from JRR Tolkien. On the stage he has played a number of Shakespearean characters including Richard II, Macbeth, Coriolanus, and King Lear. His many acting credits have led to a number of accolades over the years including several Olivier Awards.\n\nGet the biggest stories from around London straight to your inbox.

The 85-year-old actor was performing a fight scene at the No\u00ebl Coward theatre in London when he slipped and fell down to the floor level. According to a report by The Independent McKellen is expected to return to performing on Wednesday night.\n\nMcKellen is starring in a production of Player Kings, but things got out of hand on Monday, June 17 when he took a tumble off the stage. McKellen reported cried out in pain and staff rushed to help him. He was transported to the hospital and the audience was asked to leave, with the show left unfinished. McKellen was still in the hospital at the time of the latest update, but sources said he would be cleared in time for the matinee performance on Wednesday. Tuesday's scheduled show was called off altogether.\n\nMcKellen has been performing this show since April, and presumably rehearsing with the cast and crew much longer. Player Kings is a new take on Shakespeare's Henry IV, combining Part One and Part Two of the play for modern audiences. McKellen plays John Falstaff, co-starring with Richard Coyle and Toheeb Jimoh. The adaptation was written by Robert Icke.\n\nA representative for the play told reporters: \"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings. Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits. The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday 18 June so Ian can rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Thank you to doctors Rachel and Lee who were on hand in the audience and to all the venue staff for their support,\" they concluded.\"\n\nMcKellen has been in the headlines quite a bit recently, and has been joking about his age in discussions of the new Lord of the Rings projects. He told The Times that he would be open to reprising his role as Gandalf in another movie \"if I'm alive.\" On a more serious note, he said that he finds himself wondering if each job he takes on will be his last, considering his legacy. He said: \"If you want to know that you are mortal, you just have to look at your address book. And so when a script comes through, or the hint of an offer, you think, 'This might be my last job.

The remainder of Monday and Tuesday's performances had already been cancelled to allow the actor to rest.\n\n\"The performance on Wednesday 19 June will be cancelled following Ian McKellen's fall during the performance of Player Kings on Monday (17 June),\" the statement read.\n\n\"Bookers for the affected performance will be contacted by their point of purchase directly. We look forward to welcoming audiences back to the Noel Coward Theatre on Thursday 20 June.\n\n\"We are delighted that Ian is recovering well, and look forward to him returning to the production as soon as he is ready. We will keep audiences updates regarding remaining performances this week.\"\n\nUpdating fans on Sir Ian's health, a spokesperson for the London theatre said: \"Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\n\n\"The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday June 18 so Ian can rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow.\" The statement also thanked doctors Rachel and Lee who were \"on hand in the audience\" and to the venue staff \"for their support\".\n\nAfter the fall on Monday, the audience were evacuated from the theatre and informed the show would be cancelled. Charlie Johnson, who witnessed the incident, spoke to Good Morning Britain about the impact of Sir Ian's fall. He explained: \"As we approached the interval of the play, there was a fight scene going on and there were strobe lights and then it all went dark; at which point you could see the silhouette of Sir Ian come out the wings. The way the stage works at the Noel Coward, there's a step down and that's where the stage meets the audience.\n\n\"I think what happened is he took his foot too far off that initial step and lost his balance and went headfirst into the audience. Within seconds, a blood-curdling stream arose from the actor and he was clearly in a lot of pain and screaming 'help me'.\"\n\nPlayer Kings, a production of Henry IV, parts one and two, adapted and directed by Robert Icke, is due to end its run at the Noel Coward Theatre on Saturday. The play will then move to the Bristol Hippodrome in July before being staged in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

More info\n\nSir Ian McKellen's understudy will perform in the play Player Kings for its final London dates while he recuperates following a fall from the stage on Monday. The veteran screen and stage actor, 85, was performing at the Noel Coward Theatre when he lost his footing in a fight scene and fell from the stage.\n\nAfter the accident, he was taken to hospital to receive treatment and the remainder of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday's performances were cancelled to allow him to rest. A post on the Player Kings X account on Thursday said: \"David Semark will be playing the role of Sir John Falstaff for the final three scheduled performances of Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre in London while Ian McKellen recuperates following his fall on Monday 17 June.\"\n\nIt added: \"We look forward to Ian returning to the production, which begins a national tour in Bristol on Wednesday 3 July, before visiting Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.\"\n\nThe final London performances are taking place on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. His understudy, Semark, trained at the Royal Academy Of Dramatic Art (Rada) and has credits in TV shows including EastEnders, Doctors, Law & Order UK and The Bill.\n\nAfter his fall, The Lord Of The Rings star and Olivier Award-winner Sir Ian thanked everyone who had left messages of support. On X he wrote: \"I want to thank everyone for their kind messages and support.\n\n\"Since the accident, during a performance of Player Kings last night, my injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service. To them, of course, I am hugely indebted. They have assured me that my recovery will be complete and speedy and I am looking forward to returning to work.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the London theatre said in a statement to the PA news agency: \"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings. Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\n\n\"The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday June 18 so Ian can rest.\"\n\nThe statement also thanked doctors Rachel and Lee who were \"on hand in the audience\" and to the venue staff \"for their support\".\n\nA BBC journalist who saw the play said the veteran actor was in a scene involving the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy when he fell off the front of the stage. The actor was heard to cry out in pain as staff rushed to help.\n\nAfter the accident, audience members were informed that the remainder of the evening performance had been cancelled and they were evacuated from the premises. Audience member Paul Critchley, a Methodist minister from Downham Market, Norfolk, told PA it was a \"shock\" to witness the fall.\n\n\"The house lights came up very quickly as the stage management and front of house team dealt with the incident. We were evacuated immediately so that Sir Ian could be treated in privacy\", he said.

The theater was evacuated and the performance canceled.\n\nMcKellen played Magneto in the X-Men films and is one of Britain's most acclaimed Shakespearean actors, with roles including Richard III, Macbeth and King Lear.\n\nHe has won a Tony Award for Amadeus, several Olivier Awards and has been nominated for two Academy Awards, five Emmy Awards and several BAFTA Awards.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Falstaff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Falstaff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Icke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Icke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV,_Part_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV, Part 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gandalf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Olivier Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(play)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amadeus (play)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Percy_(Hotspur)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry Percy (Hotspur)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry V of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_Film_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Academy Film Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macbeth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_(play)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard III (play)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Lear"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://gray-wsaz-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/GTWZLNBJCVEVPO6CSKSZM24FXU.jpg?auth=2a72e12b4e311ef52bf55d260356513aa957b606a48474f1f6e775ec4526be93&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

We were evacuated immediately so that Sir Ian could be treated in privacy. An announcement was made by theatre management that the show had been cancelled, that Sir Ian was receiving treatment and an ambulance had been called. It was a shock to witness his fall and I wish him a speedy recovery. My thoughts are also with his fellow cast members, stage crew and front of house team at the Noel Coward Theatre.\"\n\nLondon Ambulance Service has not provided any comment on the incident.\n\nPlayer Kings, a production of Henry IV, parts one and two, adapted and directed by Robert Icke, is set to move to the Bristol Hippodrome in July and will also be staged in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.\n\nSir Ian's career, spanning over six decades, has seen him perform in theatres nationwide. He is most recognised on screen for his roles as Magneto in the X-Men films and Gandalf in Peter Jackson's fantasy trilogy, adapted from JRR Tolkien's books. On stage, he has portrayed numerous Shakespearean characters such as Richard II, Macbeth, Coriolanus, and King Lear.

After graduating with honors from the University of Texas at Austin (Hook 'em, Horns!), Lauren wrote about film, television, awards season, music, and more for the likes of The Hollywood Reporter, Deadline Hollywood, Us Weekly, Awards Circuit, and others before landing at EW in May 2019.\n\nIan McKellen was taken to the hospital after falling off the stage during a performance of Player Kings at the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre in London on Monday night.\n\nAccording to a statement from the theater provided to Entertainment Weekly, the 85-year-old actor is \"in good spirits\" and expected to make a full recovery.\n\n\"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings,\" the statement said. \"Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\"\n\nThe statement added that Tuesday's performance of Player Kings would be canceled to allow McKellen time to rest. \"Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow,\" the theater said. \"Thank you to doctors Rachel and Lee who were on hand in the audience and to all the venue staff for their support.\"\n\nAccording to the BBC, the incident occurred when McKellen was performing during a fight scene, lost his footing, and fell from the front of the stage. The show was then canceled and the audience evacuated.\n\nPlayer Kings started a planned 12-week run in April. In the production, which is a version of Shakespeare's Henry IV (parts 1 and 2) adapted by Robert Icke, McKellen stars as John Falstaff. The show includes a scene in which Falstaff circles a fight between Prince of Wales and Henry Percy, and it was at this point that McKellen is said to have fallen.\n\nAudience members reported on social media that the actor could be heard crying out in pain. Per the BBC, one audience member called the incident \"very shocking,\" and said they \"really hope that he is going to be all right,\" while noting that the actor \"was conscious because he was asking for assistance.\"\n\nWant more movie news?

He has received rave reviews so far for his performance in Player Kings, with The Guardian calling his turn a richly complex portrayal.\"\n\nThe venerable actor, who has not been shy about having no desire to retire, recently opened up about his experience playing Falstaff in an interview with The Times of London. \"If you want to know that you are mortal you just have to look at your address book,\" he said. \"And so when a script comes through, or the hint of an offer, you think, 'This might be my last job. No. I'm not doing that.' So if Falstaff is my last job, I'd better get it right, hadn't I?\"", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Hook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain Hook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Us Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Icke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Icke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Falstaff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Falstaff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Percy_(Hotspur)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry Percy (Hotspur)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falstaff_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falstaff (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coriolanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macbeth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_(play)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard III (play)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_II_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard II of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Lear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Employment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/0Vaqz8DLCYMGIPrHTALxEVtcrhs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ian-mcKellan-player-kings47-04112024-d7932da82d534e69bd578f67827ef597.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-", "textStart": 411, "textEnd": 419}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Hoping he is not badly injured, he seemed to be in great pain.'\n\nSandro Trapani told the BBC the incident was 'very shocking', adding: 'I really hope that he is going to be alright. As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance.'\n\nSir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, was born in Burnley, Lancashire, in 1939 and, alongside his sister Jean, was raised by his mother Margery and his father Denis.\n\nHe has often credited his parents for encouraging his interest in becoming a performer, previously claiming in a 2017 interview with the Irish Examiner: 'Apparently she said, 'If Ian decides to be an actor, it's a good job, because it brings pleasure to people'.'\n\nHis mother died when he was just 12 and he would lose his father at the age of 22.\n\nSir Ian acted at all the schools he attended. When at Bolton School he was able to take on his first Shakespeare performance at Hopefield Miniature Theatre when, as a 13-year-old Malvolio, he performed the letter scene from Twelfth Night.\n\nHe then won a scholarship to read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge and was soon appearing in regular productions, including appearing alongside now famous alumni such as Derek Jacobi, David Frost and Margaret Drabble.\n\nBy the time Sir Ian graduated in 1961 he had decided to become an actor, and landed his first job in a production of A Man For All Seasons at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry.\n\nSince then, he has gone on to become a household name for his acclaimed performances in everything from Shakespearean tragedies to Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nTV star: Sir Ian is shown with Marilyn Tayerson in a still from the 1972 TV show Country Matters\n\nSir Ian McKellen attends the press night after party for 'Player Kings' at St Martins Lane Hotel on April 11, 2024 in London\n\nIan McKellen (Edward II), James Laurenson (Piers Gaveston) in EDWARD II by Christopher Marlowe directed by Toby Robertson for the Prospect Theatre Company at the Piccadilly Theatre, London in 1970\n\nDonald Sutherland, Ian McKellen, Stockard Channing and Will Smith (right to left) in the film Six Degrees Of Separation in 1994\n\nSir Ian McKellen as David Masterman, and Susan Penhaligon, as Ianthe Forrest in the TV show Country Matters in 1972\n\nIan McKellen, Claire Sweeney and Paul O'Grady on The Paul O'Grady show in 2005\n\nPaul Eddington as Lyov and Sir Ian McKellen as Stefan in the ITV Sunday Night Theatre in 1972\n\nHe shot to international acclaim for his film work, receiving an Academy Award nomination in 1998 for Best Actor after he starred in Gods and Monsters.\n\nIn 2019, the actor topped the The Stage 100 list of most influential people in British Theatre following his UK Tour of Ian McKellen on Stage.\n\nSir Ian was knighted in 1991 for services to theatre and was later appointed a Companion of Honour for services to drama and equality by Queen Elizabeth II in 2008.\n\nSir Ian has been nominated for 12 Olivier Awards and won six for his roles in Pillars Of The Community, The Alchemist, Bent, Wild Honey, Richard III and his one-man show Ian McKellen On Stage.\n\nOver the past six decades, Sir Ian has taken on the role of almost every Shakespeare male protagonist - but he was 'never attracted to' playing the character of Falstaff until he was persuaded to by director Robert Icke.\n\nAfter Player Kings' run at the Noel Coward theatre, the show will tour the country. It is due to move to the Bristol Hippodrome in July and will also be staged in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.\n\nThe play brings together Shakespeare's two history plays (Henry IV, parts 1 and 2) with the cast including Toheen Jimoh as Hal and Richard Coyle as King Henry IV.\n\nIn April, Sir Ian had to take drastic, and speedy, measures to ensure he made it across London in time for his daily performance of the show - riding on the back of a motorbike.\n\nOne source said at the time: 'Sir Ian tried getting picked up by a car provided by theatre bosses but it took so long to get across town it was pointless.\n\n'One night it took him 90 minutes to get from his home. After that, it was decided a motorbike was the only option.'\n\nIan McKellen starred opposite Martin Freeman in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies in 2014\n\nIan McKellen (Percy) and Roger Allam (Frank) in the play Frank and Percy in 2023\n\nHalle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen in X-Men: The Last Stand in 2006\n\nSir Ian McKellen starred in Hamlet at the Theatre Royal in Windsor in 2021\n\nRecorded in front of an audience at the Harold Pinter Theatre in January 2020, the production of Ian McKellen on Stage is available to stream online\n\nSir Ian McKellen is pictured above in Hamlet at the Theatre Royal in Windsor in 2021\n\nan McKellen (Sorin) and Frances Barber (Arkadina) in 'The Seagull' by The Royal Shakespeare Company in 2007\n\nMother Goose the pantomime starring Ian McKellen as Mother Goose and John Bishop as Vic Goose at the Theatre Royal Brighton in 2022\n\nHe has also previously had to pull out of performances due to injuries.\n\nIn 2018, he had to apologise to theatre-goers after a leg injury forced him to pull out of a performance of King Lear. Sir Ian had been rushing to catch the train and pulled his calf muscle.\n\nLast September, Sir Ian opened up about his life changing 'overnight' when he came out as gay 35 years ago. Very few people knew of his homosexuality at a young age, including his parents.\n\nIn 1988, he publicly came out on a BBC Radio 4 programme while discussing Margaret Thatcher's Section 28 legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offence.\n\nHe said of the law: 'I think it's offensive to anyone who is, like myself, homosexual, apart from the whole business of what can or cannot be taught to children.' Section 28 was eventually fully repealed in 2003.\n\nSir Ian has spoken about his experiences on coming out on several occasions.\n\nBack in July 2000, he wrote in The Independent: 'The only good thing I can think to say about Section 28 is that it finally encouraged me to come out. A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.'\n\nHe told Variety about coming out in 1988: 'Almost overnight everything in my life changed for the better - my relationships with people and my whole attitude toward acting changed.'\n\nSir Ian told how coming out actually had a huge impact on his acting work.\n\nHe explained: 'The kind of acting that I had been good at was all about disguise - adopting funny voices and odd walks.\n\nLast September, Sir Ian (pictured in 1978) opened up about his life changing 'overnight' when he came out as gay 35 years ago. Very few people knew of his homosexuality at a young age, including his parents\n\nPeople demonstrate against Clause 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 which states that a local authority 'shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality', in February 1988, with Sir Ian and Michael Cashman in the front row\n\nIan McKellen and Sir Patrick Stewart kiss on the red carpet during the 'Star Trek Picard' UK Premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square on January 15, 2020 in London\n\nMother Goose the pantomime starring Ian McKellen as Mother Goose and John Bishop as Vic Goose at the Theatre Royal Brighton in 2022\n\nIan McKellen is pictured above at the Clause 28 March in Manchester in February 1988\n\n'It was about lying to the world. I was no longer in the situation where I was running along beside the character explaining it to the audience. I just became the character.'\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: 'What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.'\n\nIan also said he felt that it was difficult for non-gay people to relate to his struggle.\n\nThe veteran actor said: 'People who are not gay just simply don't know how it damages you to be lying about what you are and ashamed of yourself.\n\n'I was brought up at a time when it was illegal for me to have sex with a man. And that was not that long ago,' he added.\n\nHe previously revealed how he had to 'swear he wasn't gay' in order to work on Broadway in the 1960s.\n\nJust last week, Sir Ian made headlines after he took a swipe at former US president Donald Trump - accusing him of being 'one of the worst public speakers there has ever been'.\n\nHe told The Times: 'Trump is an absolute bewilderment. I haven't seen him live. But he's one of the worst public speakers there has ever been. Whether he's reading a script or not, it's so patent what he is.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Image by Wikimedia Commons\n\nSir Ian McKellen, who played Gandalf in the extremely popular Lord of the Rings movies, fell off a London stage during a fight scene in a play after tripping over stage props. The actor was hospitalised, but is recovering well.\n\nSir Ian McKellen, 85, screamed out in agony as he tripped over props and plunged off the stage during a West End performance on 17 June. A staff member rushed on stage to help him. Many of the shocked audience members were in tears as medics took the acting legend to hospital.\n\nMcKellen tumbled off the front of the stage in a 'belly flop fashion' just before the intermission of Player Kings at the No\u00ebl Coward theatre in London. Player Kings is a production of Shakespeare's Henry IV Parts One and Two. It started its 12-week West End run in April. At first, audience members thought it was part of the performance, until the actor screamed out.\n\nTheatre staff evacuated the audience members from the theatre at around 20:00 while medical personnel assisted the actor. Luckily, there were two doctors present in the audience who also assisted. The actor was hospitalised. The theatre consequently cancelled the show, according to Daily Mail. They also cancelled the next show, scheduled for 18 June.\n\nBBC reported that McKellen is in 'good spirits' after being hospitalised. A theatre spokesperson said that he had undergone a scan and medics said that they expect him to make a speedy and full recovery. If everything goes well, he will be back on stage on Wednesday, 19 June, for a matinee performance of the play.\n\nThe stage and screen veteran is one of Britain's most acclaimed Shakespearean actors, with roles including Richard III, Macbeth, and King Lear. However, his talents extent beyond Shakespearean roles. He is very well-known for his role as Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings movies and played Magneto in the X-Men movies. This shows how versatile he is as an actor.\n\nDefinitely a legend, McKellen has been in over 60 feature films in a career that spans seven decades. He has won a Tony Award for Amadeus as well as several Olivier Awards. He has received nominations for two Academy Awards, five Emmys, and several BAFTA awards, according to The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "thesouthafrican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The South African"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West End theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gandalf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV,_Part_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV, Part 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Olivier Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(play)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amadeus (play)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_Film_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Academy Film Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macbeth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_(play)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard III (play)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Lear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Screen Actors Guild Awards", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thesouthafrican.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ian-McK-Custom.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 426, "textEnd": 433}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1293, "textEnd": 1300}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 1571, "textEnd": 1578}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Whilst leaving the theatre within 10 minutes he was in the back of an ambulance speeding down Trafalgar Square.'\n\nRead More Sir Ian McKellen, 85, is rushed to hospital after falling off stage: Audience left 'in tears'\n\nDescribing what caused the actor to fall, he explained: 'The scene in question was a warzone so there was broken up bricks and daggers from the battle and the set which was all torn up for that scene.'\n\nHe said there was 'so much concern and shock for Sir Ian', adding: 'Everyone I think is just such huge fans of his work and with his age just really empathetic and almost terrified that it could be life-threatening because of his age.'\n\nMr Baker said that Sir Ian had been 'performing amazingly with great vigour' before he fell.\n\nWhen asked how the audience reacted, the theatregoer added: 'Instantly people were standing up, the first two rows completely went to rush to go help Sir Ian and everyone was explaining 'oh my god' and 'that poor man'.\n\n'It was very sincere and so much concern for his well-being,' he added. 'He had made everyone laugh so much this evening.'\n\nA spokesperson for Player Kings told MailOnline: 'Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings.\n\n'Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\n\n'The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday 18 June so Ian can rest.

We were evacuated immediately so that Sir Ian could be treated in privacy.\n\n'An announcement was made by theatre management that the show had been cancelled, that Sir Ian was receiving treatment and an ambulance had been called.\n\n'It was a shock to witness his fall and I wish him a speedy recovery. My thoughts are also with his fellow cast members, stage crew and front of house team at the Noel Coward Theatre.'\n\nOthers expressed their horror online.

Staff working hard to help him. Thoughts with him, cast and crew.'\n\nAnd a third said: 'Shocking to watch, it was a terrible fall. Hoping he is not badly injured, he seemed to be in great pain.'\n\nSandro Trapani told the BBC the incident was 'very shocking', adding: 'I really hope that he is going to be alright. As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance.'\n\nSir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, was born in Burnley, Lancashire, in 1939 and, alongside his sister Jean, was raised by his mother Margery and his father Denis.\n\nHe has often credited his parents for encouraging his interest in becoming a performer, previously claiming in a 2017 interview with the Irish Examiner: 'Apparently she said, 'If Ian decides to be an actor, it's a good job, because it brings pleasure to people'.'\n\nHis mother died when he was just 12 and he would lose his father at the age of 22.\n\nSir Ian acted at all the schools he attended. When at Bolton School he was able to take on his first Shakespeare performance at Hopefield Miniature Theatre when, as a 13-year-old Malvolio, he performed the letter scene from Twelfth Night.\n\nHe then won a scholarship to read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge and was soon appearing in regular productions, including appearing alongside now famous alumni such as Derek Jacobi, David Frost and Margaret Drabble.\n\nBy the time Sir Ian graduated in 1961 he had decided to become an actor, and landed his first job in a production of A Man For All Seasons at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry.\n\nSince then, he has gone on to become a household name for his acclaimed performances in everything from Shakespearean tragedies to Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nTV star: Sir Ian is shown with Marilyn Tayerson in a still from the 1972 TV show Country Matters\n\nSir Ian McKellen attends the press night after party for 'Player Kings' at St Martins Lane Hotel on April 11, 2024 in London\n\nIan McKellen (Edward II), James Laurenson (Piers Gaveston) in EDWARD II by Christopher Marlowe directed by Toby Robertson for the Prospect Theatre Company at the Piccadilly Theatre, London in 1970\n\nDonald Sutherland, Ian McKellen, Stockard Channing and Will Smith (right to left) in the film Six Degrees Of Separation in 1994\n\nSir Ian McKellen as David Masterman, and Susan Penhaligon, as Ianthe Forrest in the TV show Country Matters in 1972\n\nIan McKellen, Claire Sweeney and Paul O'Grady on The Paul O'Grady show in 2005\n\nPaul Eddington as Lyov and Sir Ian McKellen as Stefan in the ITV Sunday Night Theatre in 1972\n\nHe shot to international acclaim for his film work, receiving an Academy Award nomination in 1998 for Best Actor after he starred in Gods and Monsters.\n\nIn 2019, the actor topped the The Stage 100 list of most influential people in British Theatre following his UK Tour of Ian McKellen on Stage.\n\nSir Ian was knighted in 1991 for services to theatre and was later appointed a Companion of Honour for services to drama and equality by Queen Elizabeth II in 2008.\n\nSir Ian has been nominated for 12 Olivier Awards and won six for his roles in Pillars Of The Community, The Alchemist, Bent, Wild Honey, Richard III and his one-man show Ian McKellen On Stage.\n\nOver the past six decades, Sir Ian has taken on the role of almost every Shakespeare male protagonist - but he was 'never attracted to' playing the character of Falstaff until he was persuaded to by director Robert Icke.\n\nAfter Player Kings' run at the Noel Coward theatre, the show will tour the country. It is due to move to the Bristol Hippodrome in July and will also be staged in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.\n\nThe play brings together Shakespeare's two history plays (Henry IV, parts 1 and 2) with the cast including Toheen Jimoh as Hal and Richard Coyle as King Henry IV.\n\nIn April, Sir Ian had to take drastic, and speedy, measures to ensure he made it across London in time for his daily performance of the show - riding on the back of a motorbike.\n\nOne source said at the time: 'Sir Ian tried getting picked up by a car provided by theatre bosses but it took so long to get across town it was pointless.\n\n'One night it took him 90 minutes to get from his home. After that, it was decided a motorbike was the only option.'\n\nIan McKellen starred opposite Martin Freeman in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies in 2014\n\nIan McKellen (Percy) and Roger Allam (Frank) in the play Frank and Percy in 2023\n\nHalle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen in X-Men: The Last Stand in 2006\n\nSir Ian McKellen starred in Hamlet at the Theatre Royal in Windsor in 2021\n\nRecorded in front of an audience at the Harold Pinter Theatre in January 2020, the production of Ian McKellen on Stage is available to stream online\n\nSir Ian McKellen is pictured above in Hamlet at the Theatre Royal in Windsor in 2021\n\nan McKellen (Sorin) and Frances Barber (Arkadina) in 'The Seagull' by The Royal Shakespeare Company in 2007\n\nMother Goose the pantomime starring Ian McKellen as Mother Goose and John Bishop as Vic Goose at the Theatre Royal Brighton in 2022\n\nHe has also previously had to pull out of performances due to injuries.\n\nIn 2018, he had to apologise to theatre-goers after a leg injury forced him to pull out of a performance of King Lear. Sir Ian had been rushing to catch the train and pulled his calf muscle.\n\nLast September, Sir Ian opened up about his life changing 'overnight' when he came out as gay 35 years ago. Very few people knew of his homosexuality at a young age, including his parents.\n\nIn 1988, he publicly came out on a BBC Radio 4 programme while discussing Margaret Thatcher's Section 28 legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offence.\n\nHe said of the law: 'I think it's offensive to anyone who is, like myself, homosexual, apart from the whole business of what can or cannot be taught to children.' Section 28 was eventually fully repealed in 2003.\n\nSir Ian has spoken about his experiences on coming out on several occasions.\n\nBack in July 2000, he wrote in The Independent: 'The only good thing I can think to say about Section 28 is that it finally encouraged me to come out. A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.'\n\nHe told Variety about coming out in 1988: 'Almost overnight everything in my life changed for the better - my relationships with people and my whole attitude toward acting changed.'\n\nSir Ian told how coming out actually had a huge impact on his acting work.\n\nHe explained: 'The kind of acting that I had been good at was all about disguise - adopting funny voices and odd walks.\n\nLast September, Sir Ian (pictured in 1978) opened up about his life changing 'overnight' when he came out as gay 35 years ago. Very few people knew of his homosexuality at a young age, including his parents\n\nPeople demonstrate against Clause 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 which states that a local authority 'shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality', in February 1988, with Sir Ian and Michael Cashman in the front row\n\nIan McKellen and Sir Patrick Stewart kiss on the red carpet during the 'Star Trek Picard' UK Premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square on January 15, 2020 in London\n\nMother Goose the pantomime starring Ian McKellen as Mother Goose and John Bishop as Vic Goose at the Theatre Royal Brighton in 2022\n\nIan McKellen is pictured above at the Clause 28 March in Manchester in February 1988\n\n'It was about lying to the world. I was no longer in the situation where I was running along beside the character explaining it to the audience. I just became the character.'\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: 'What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.'\n\nIan also said he felt that it was difficult for non-gay people to relate to his struggle.\n\nThe veteran actor said: 'People who are not gay just simply don't know how it damages you to be lying about what you are and ashamed of yourself.\n\n'I was brought up at a time when it was illegal for me to have sex with a man. And that was not that long ago,' he added.\n\nHe previously revealed how he had to 'swear he wasn't gay' in order to work on Broadway in the 1960s.\n\nJust last week, Sir Ian made headlines after he took a swipe at former US president Donald Trump - accusing him of being 'one of the worst public speakers there has ever been'.\n\nHe told The Times: 'Trump is an absolute bewilderment. I haven't seen him live. But he's one of the worst public speakers there has ever been. Whether he's reading a script or not, it's so patent what he is.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The 85-year-old actor was performing the role of John Falstaff when the incident happened, resulting in the play being immediately stopped, the audience sent away, and McKellen rushed to hospital.\n\nThe accident occurred at the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre during a battle scene between the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy in Robert Icke's modern adaptation of Henry IV. Audience members were noted to have seen McKellen trip near the front of the stage before he fell off the edge. The house lights immediately went up and staff rushed to help the actor as he reportedly cried out. According to The Guardian McKellen is recovering well and is \"in good spirits\" and expected to make \"a speedy and full recovery.\" Tuesday night's performance was also canceled in order to allow the actor to rest. He was initially expected to be back on the stage for Wednesday's matinee but that performance was also canceled.\n\nThe actor released a statement through his personal publicist Clair Dobbs which was reported by Deadline. The statement read,\n\n\"I want to thank everyone for their kind messages and support. Since the accident, during a performance of Player Kings last night, my injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service. To them, of course, I am hugely indebted. They have assured me that my recovery will be complete and speedy and I am looking forward to returning to work.\"\n\nAccording to Deadline, McKellen has suffered a fractured wrist from his fall.\n\nAudience members were obviously shocked and concerned to witness the actor's accident. One audience member, Sandro Trapani, spoke to the BBC about the accident saying it was \"very shocking,\" adding \"I really hope that he is going to be all right. As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance.\"\n\nMcKellen's career as an actor has spanned over 60 years, working across stage, television, and film. His most prominent roles on the silver screen include that of the complex antagonist Magneto in the X-Men franchise as well as his career-defining turn as the wizard Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogy. On stage, McKellen has played some of the most famous characters in English theatre history including numerous Shakespearean roles such as King Lear, Coriolanus, Richard II, and Macbeth.\n\nThis isn't the first time an injury has interfered with the actor's work. Five years ago, he was forced to cancel a performance of King Lear after injuring his leg whilst running for the train. Rather than allow the audience to be left with nothing, he instead sat on the edge of the stage and opened up a Q&A session.

We are all in shock and tears.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Audience shocked by Sir Ian McKellen's fall off stage tonight at Noel Coward Theatre. Staff working hard to help him. Thoughts with him, cast and crew.'\n\nAnd a third said: 'Shocking to watch, it was a terrible fall. Hoping he is not badly injured, he seemed to be in great pain.'\n\nSandro Trapani told the BBC the incident was 'very shocking', adding: 'I really hope that he is going to be alright. As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance.'\n\nSir Ian's representatives and the London Ambulance Service have been approached for comment.\n\nSir Ian, who was born in Burnley, Lancashire, is noted for his work with the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nHe shot to international acclaim for his film work, receiving an Academy Award nomination in 1998 for Best Actor after he starred in Gods and Monsters.\n\nIn 2019, the actor topped the The Stage 100 list of most influential people in British Theatre following his UK Tour of Ian McKellen on Stage.\n\nSir Ian was knighted in 1991 for services to theatre and was later appointed a Companion of Honour for services to drama and equality by Queen Elizabeth II in 2008.\n\nOver the past six decades, Sir Ian has taken on the role of almost every Shakespeare male protagonist - but he was 'never attracted to' playing the character of Falstaff until he was persuaded to by director Robert Icke.\n\nAfter Player Kings' run at the Noel Coward theatre, the show will tour the country. It is due to move to the Bristol Hippodrome in July and will also be staged in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.\n\nThe play brings together Shakespeare's two history plays (Henry IV, parts 1 and 2) with the cast including Toheen Jimoh as Hal and Richard Coyle as King Henry IV.\n\nIn April, Sir Ian had to take drastic, and speedy, measures to ensure he made it across London in time for his daily performance of the show - riding on the back of a motorbike.\n\nOne source said at the time: 'Sir Ian tried getting picked up by a car provided by theatre bosses but it took so long to get across town it was pointless.\n\n'One night it took him 90 minutes to get from his home. After that, it was decided a motorbike was the only option.'\n\nHe has also previously had to pull out of performances due to injuries. In 2018, he had to apologise to theatre-goers after a leg injury forced him to pull out of a performance of King Lear. Sir Ian had been rushing to catch the train and pulled his calf muscle.\n\nLast September, Sir Ian opened up about his life changing 'overnight' when he came out as gay in 1988.\n\nHe told Variety: 'Almost overnight everything in my life changed for the better - my relationships with people and my whole attitude toward acting changed.'\n\nSir Ian told how coming out actually had a huge impact on his acting work.\n\nHe explained: 'The kind of acting that I had been good at was all about disguise - adopting funny voices and odd walks.\n\n'It was about lying to the world. I was no longer in the situation where I was running along beside the character explaining it to the audience. I just became the character.'\n\nIan also said he felt that it was difficult for non-gay people to relate to his struggle.\n\nThe veteran actor said: 'People who are not gay just simply don't know how it damages you to be lying about what you are and ashamed of yourself.\n\n'I was brought up at a time when it was illegal for me to have sex with a man. And that was not that long ago,' he added.\n\nHe previously revealed how he had to 'swear he wasn't gay' in order to work on Broadway in the 1960s.\n\nJust last week, Sir Ian made headlines after he took a swipe at former US president Donald Trump - accusing him of being 'one of the worst public speakers there has ever been'.\n\nHe told The Times: 'Trump is an absolute bewilderment. I haven't seen him live. But he's one of the worst public speakers there has ever been. Whether he's reading a script or not, it's so patent what he is.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Sir Ian lost his footing during a fight scene as he portrayed John Falstaff in Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.\n\nSharing his support for the NHS on X, formerly known as Twitter, Sir Ian wrote: \"I want to thank everyone for their kind messages and support. Since the accident, during a performance of Player Kings last night, my injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service.\n\n\"To them, of course, I am hugely indebted. They have assured me that my recovery will be complete and speedy and I am looking forward to returning to work.\"\n\nFans of the legendary actor shared their support as one wrote: \"Wishing one of my favourite actors of all time a speedy recovery!\" Another commented: \"Fantastic news, be well Sir! #NationalTreasure.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the production shared a statement confirming the cancellation of Wednesday's performance. The remainder of Monday and Tuesday's performances had already been cancelled to allow the actor to rest.\n\n\"The performance on Wednesday 19 June will be cancelled following Ian McKellen's fall during the performance of Player Kings on Monday (17 June)\", the statement read.\n\n\"Bookers for the affected performance will be contacted by their point of purchase directly. We look forward to welcoming audiences back to the Noel Coward Theatre on Thursday 20 June.\n\n\"We are delighted that Ian is recovering well, and look forward to him returning to the production as soon as he is ready. We will keep audiences updates regarding remaining performances this week.\"\n\nUpdating fans on Sir Ian's health, a spokesperson for the London theatre said: \"Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\n\n\"The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday June 18 so Ian can rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow.\" The statement also thanked doctors Rachel and Lee who were \"on hand in the audience\" and to the venue staff \"for their support\".\n\nAfter the fall on Monday, the audience were evacuated from the theatre and informed the show would be cancelled. Charlie Johnson, who witnessed the incident, spoke to Good Morning Britain about the impact of Sir Ian's fall. He explained: \"As we approached the interval of the play, there was a fight scene going on and there were strobe lights and then it all went dark; at which point you could see the silhouette of Sir Ian come out the wings.

McKellen, 85, was engaged in a fight scene when he lost his footing, leading to his fall. The audience was quickly evacuated as the actor cried out in pain, and crew members rushed to assist him.\n\nAn eyewitness and audience member, Sandro Trapani, shared his concern with the outlet, saying, \"I really hope that he is going to be all right... As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance.\"\n\nMcKellen, who portrays John Falstaff in the play, has been a central figure in the production since its debut in April. Despite his extensive career, he recently expressed a willingness to return to his iconic role as Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings franchise, provided he is still in good health. In an interview with The Times of London on June 7, he stated, \"If I'm alive,\" while also noting, \"But there is no script, there is no offer, there is no plan.\"\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't the first time the X-Men actor had to cancel a performance. Five years ago, McKellen had to cancel a performance of King Lear at London's Duke of York Theatre due to a leg injury he sustained while running to catch a train. Despite the setback, he made sure the audience still had an enjoyable experience by sitting on stage and answering their questions.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jane_lacroix@newsweek.com", "name": "Jane LaCroix", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falstaff_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falstaff (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapani", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trapani"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trapani"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gandalf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke of York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Lear"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2411742/sir-ian-mckellen.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=35ed2e8d5ffb996ddeeedbdf98241549", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 123, "textEnd": 130}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1122, "textEnd": 1128}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

It has not been reported if he sustained injuries. After the accident, the audience was asked to leave the theater and told the evening show cancelled. Sources also state that he is set to make a speedy recovery.\n\nThe Player Kings is an adaptation William Shakespeare's Henry IV, Parts One and Two. The play started its West End run in April and is expected to run for 12 weeks. McKellen plays John Falstaff, companion to Prince Hal, the future King Henry V.\n\nHe fell during the battle scene between the Prince of Wales (Ted Lasso's Toheeb Jimoh) and Henry Percy. When the house lights came up, the actor cried out which prompted the staff to rush to his aid.\n\nSir Ian McKellen falls\n\nAn audience member told the BBC that the accident was \"very shocking.\"\n\n\"I really hope he is going to be alright,\" he added.\n\n\"As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance,\" the audience member continued.\n\nOn film, McKellen was last seen in the 2023 British period thriller The Critic. He also voiced the narrator in Ted. He has been more active in the theater, most notably in Waiting for Godot/No Man's Land, where he starred opposite his long-time friend Sir Patrick Stewart.\n\nMcKellen has been nominated twice for an Academy Award: the first in 1999 for best actor for Gods and Monsters and the second in 2002 for best supporting actor for Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.\n\nHe won a Tony Award in 1981 for best actor in a leading role in a play for Amadeus. The actor also has six Olivier Awards: three of them he won consecutive from 1979 to 1979. He won the fourth in 1984 for actor of the year in a revival -- the same award he won the first time -- for Wild Honey. His fifth was for best actor in a leading role in 1991 for Richard III. His latest was a Special Award in 2020 for Ian McKellen on Stage. He also won a Golden Globe in 1997 for best supporting actor -- television for Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny.\n\nBefore his iconic role as Gandalf in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films, he was better known as a stage actor. His Shakespearean credits include playing Richard II, Coriolanus, Iago, King Lear and MacBeth. He is yet to star as another Shakespearean character in a new film adaptation of Hamlet directed by Sean Mathias.\n\nHis lifelong friendship with Stewart also echoed on screen as they played the friends-turned-enemies-turned-allies in the X-Men movies, with McKellen as the antihero Magneto and Stewart the leader of the X-Men, Professor X.\n\nIn 2018, the actor had to cancel a King Lear showing at London's Duke of York theater when he injured his leg as he was running to catch a train.

He was rushed to the hospital, but according to a statement from the Noel Coward Theater where the actor was performing, McKellen is doing okay and should be back on the stage soon.\n\nIt was during the Monday evening performance that the accident occurred. In a statement released by the theater (via Variety) while no specific details are given regarding his injuries, it appears that they were minor. The Tuesday evening performance has been canceled so the actor can recover, but plans are for the show to go on as of Wednesday. The statement reads in part...\n\nAccording to reports, the scene in question involved two other actors involved in a fight scene, while McKellen circled around them. It was during this that he apparently took a bad step and fell off the front of the stage. Based on the statement things are looking good for Ian McKellen but at the time things didn't sound so good. A theater critic in attendance stated McKellen could be heard \"screaming in pain\" following the fall.\n\nFalling from a stage certainly isn't going to feel good but aside from, one assumes, some bruises, it sounds like he's ok. Bones could have been broken but it seems like that's not the case.\n\nMcKellen has gained fame in roles such as The Lord of the Rings and the X-Men movies but has never entirely stopped performing on stage where he got his start. He once counseled his friend Patrick Stewart to not do Star Trek because it would take him away from the stage.\n\nIt's wonderful to read that Ian McKellen is doing ok and the worst thing that's happening is that a single performance is being cancelled. A stage fall certainly could have been a great deal worse, especially for the 85-year-old actor. Elsewhere in the statement, it's mentioned two doctors in the performance's audience offered their assistance.

Whilst leaving the theatre within 10 minutes, he was in the back of an ambulance speeding down Trafalgar Square,\" he added.\n\nMcKellen's fall sent show attendees into a frenzy as they expressed their worried concern for McKellen's well-being.\n\nMr Baker noted that the accident, in conjunction with the actor's age, made the audience \"really empathetic and almost terrified that it could be life-threatening because of his age.\"\n\n\"Instantly people were standing up, the first two rows completely went to rush to go help Sir Ian and everyone was explaining 'oh my god' and 'that poor man,'\" he said of the crowd's reaction to the actor's fall.\n\n\"It was very sincere and so much concern for his well-being,\" he added. \"He had made everyone laugh so much this evening.\"\n\nThe renowned actor has since been hospitalized.

The actor suffered a fractured wrist during a fight sequence, similar to previous injuries in the same scene. Despite the accident, McKellen remains in good spirits and looks forward to returning to work on stage.\n\nSir Ian McKellen is on the mend after a \"shocking\" fall the 85-year-old actor suffered during a recent performance in London, taking time out of his recovery to thank those who sent him kind words of support, as well as the staff of the National Health Service looking after him. McKellan was on stage portraying John Falstaff when the incident occurred during a performance of Player Kings at the No\u00ebl Coward Theater in the West End, which saw McKellen fall off the stage during a fight sequence. The Lord of the Rings actor was said to be in good spirits following the incident, with word coming that he would make a \"speedy and full recovery.\"\n\nTaking to X (formerly Twitter), McKellen posted a big thank you to his nearly 4 million followers who offered words of encouragement in the hours after his fall. He would also thank the workers of the National Health Service, whom he says he is \"hugely indebted\" to. Check out his post below, where the actor says he's also \"looking forward to returning to work.\"\n\nAs mentioned, the accident occurred during a fight sequence in Player Kings, which brings Shakespeare's Henry IV Parts 1 & 2 together into one raucous affair written and directed by Robert Icke. McKellen was said to have suffered a fractured wrist thanks to the fall, which audiences called \"shocking.\" An outpouring of support quickly found its way online after the news was shared by theatergoers, with some said to have been \"in tears\" after witnessing the accident.\n\nOther Actors Have Been Injured Before in the Same Scene as Ian McKellen Close\n\nAs a longtime lover of theater, Ian McKellen first appeared on stage in 1964's A Scent of Flowers before going to star in such Shakespeare classics as Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, and Macbeth. He won his one and only Tony Award in 1981 for 'Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Play' thanks to his work in Amadeus. He was nominated again in 1983 for the same award for his performance in Acting Shakespeare, but lost out to fellow English actor Jeremy Irons, who took home the award for his work in Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing.\n\nMcKellen took on the role of John Falstaff in Player Kings this past April, and according to his former understudy, David Weston, this isn't the first time someone has been injured in the same scene. As per The Independent, Weston wrote in his book 'Covering McKellen: An Understudy's Tale' about the time actor Tony Britton was injured by a gash to the head, before going on to mention his own unfortunate accident that occurred during a performance.\n\n\"My Prince Hal lunged at me, I parried with my dagger, swung round and found myself hurtling off the slippery metal stage on to the ancient stones five feet below. I fell on to a rock, still holding my sword tightly in my left hand, and broke my wrist .\"\n\nRelated Lord of the Rings Star Shares His Condition for Reprising His Role in The Hunt for Gollum\n\nIan McKellan played Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, but will he return for The Hunt for Gollum.\n\nSeeing as how Player Kings is a recently-updated version of Henry IV Parts 1 & 2 that builds toward the Battle of Shrewsbury, Weston can only be referring to scenes in the original plays, which have obviously worked their way into Robert Icke's take on the material.\n\nRegardless, we here at MovieWeb are happy to hear that Sir Ian McKellen is on the mend and in good spirits, and we continue to wish him a speedy recovery.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news",

Audience members told MailOnline the 85-year-old tumbled off the front of the stage in a 'belly flop fashion' and yelled 'help me... my arms' just before the interval of Player Kings at the No\u00ebl Coward theatre in London.\n\nThe crowd were evacuated from the theatre at around 8pm while medics were called to the venue - and ticket holders were told the evening show had been cancelled. Representatives for the production confirmed that Sir Ian 'will make a speedy and full recovery' and is in 'good spirits' - but Tuesday night's performance has also been cancelled so he can rest. Sir Ian - who plays John Falstaff in the play - was circling a battle scene involving the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy, when he tripped and fell off the stage.\n\nAs the house lights came up, the actor best known for his portrayals of Gandalf in the Lord Of The Rings franchise and Magneto in X-Men, cried out in pain as ushers and two medics in the audience rushed to help him. Kol Baker, who was watching the show from the second tier, told MailOnline that Sir Ian had been 'berating the villain and moving around' during the scene when he 'tripped over' some props and fell off the stage 'in almost a belly flop fashion'. 'Instantly he screamed and honestly the noises were bone-chilling,' the 23-year-old added - as he recalled Sir Ian yelling 'help me, help me' followed by 'my arms, my arms' and 'help me, help me' again. 'The lights were on so quickly the curtains drawn and within seconds they asked to evacuate the whole auditorium. Whilst leaving the theatre within 10 minutes he was in the back of an ambulance speeding down Trafalgar Square.'\n\nDescribing what caused the actor to fall, he explained: 'The scene in question was a warzone so there was broken up bricks and daggers from the battle and the set which was all torn up for that scene.' He said there was 'so much concern and shock for Sir Ian', adding: 'Everyone I think is just such huge fans of his work and with his age just really empathetic and almost terrified that it could be life-threatening because of his age.' Mr Baker said that Sir Ian had been 'performing amazingly with great vigour' before he fell. When asked how the audience reacted, the theatregoer added: 'Instantly people were standing up, the first two rows completely went to rush to go help Sir Ian and everyone was explaining 'oh my god' and 'that poor man'. 'It was very sincere and so much concern for his well-being,' he added. 'He had made everyone laugh so much this evening.'\n\nA spokesperson for Player Kings told MailOnline: 'Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings. 'Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits. 'The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday 18 June so Ian can rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow. 'Thank you to doctors Rachel and Lee who were on hand in the audience and to all the venue staff for their support.' At least three London ambulances were pictured outside the theatre. Player Kings, which started its 12-week West End run in April, is a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two.\n\nMany in the audience shared their shock at the incident on social media last night. Paul Critchley, a Methodist minister from Downham Market, Norfolk, said: 'Sir Ian seemed to trip as he moved downstage to take a more active part in the scene. 'He picked up momentum as he moved downstage which resulted in him falling off the stage directly in front of the audience. 'The house lights came up very quickly as the stage management and front of house team dealt with the incident. We were evacuated immediately so that Sir Ian could be treated in privacy. 'An announcement was made by theatre management that the show had been cancelled, that Sir Ian was receiving treatment and an ambulance had been called. 'It was a shock to witness his fall and I wish him a speedy recovery. My thoughts are also with his fellow cast members, stage crew and front of house team at the Noel Coward Theatre.' Others expressed their horror online. One tweeted: 'Just witnessed an awful accident with Sir Ian McKellen tripping off the stage in London. He seems badly hurt. We are all in shock and tears.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Audience shocked by Sir Ian McKellen's fall off stage tonight at Noel Coward Theatre. Staff working hard to help him. Thoughts with him, cast and crew.' And a third said: 'Shocking to watch, it was a terrible fall. Hoping he is not badly injured, he seemed to be in great pain.' Sandro Trapani told the BBC the incident was 'very shocking', adding: 'I really hope that he is going to be alright. As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance.' Sir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, was born in Burnley, Lancashire, in 1939 and, alongside his sister Jean, was raised by his mother Margery and his father Denis. He has often credited his parents for encouraging his interest in becoming a performer, previously claiming in a 2017 interview with the Irish Examiner: 'Apparently she said, 'If Ian decides to be an actor, it's a good job, because it brings pleasure to people'.' His mother died when he was just 12 and he would lose his father at the age of 22. Sir Ian acted at all the schools he attended. When at Bolton School he was able to take on his first Shakespeare performance at Hopefield Miniature Theatre when, as a 13-year-old Malvolio, he performed the letter scene from Twelfth Night.\n\nHe then won a scholarship to read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge and was soon appearing in regular productions, including appearing alongside now famous alumni such as Derek Jacobi, David Frost and Margaret Drabble. By the time Sir Ian graduated in 1961 he had decided to become an actor, and landed his first job in a production of A Man For All Seasons at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry. Since then, he has gone on to become a household name for his acclaimed performances in everything from Shakespearean tragedies to Hollywood blockbusters. He shot to international acclaim for his film work, receiving an Academy Award nomination in 1998 for Best Actor after he starred in Gods and Monsters. In 2019, the actor topped the The Stage 100 list of most influential people in British Theatre following his UK Tour of Ian McKellen on Stage. Sir Ian was knighted in 1991 for services to theatre and was later appointed a Companion of Honour for services to drama and equality by Queen Elizabeth II in 2008. Sir Ian has been nominated for 12 Olivier Awards and won six for his roles in Pillars Of The Community, The Alchemist, Bent, Wild Honey, Richard III and his one-man show Ian McKellen On Stage.\n\nOver the past six decades, Sir Ian has taken on the role of almost every Shakespeare male protagonist - but he was 'never attracted to' playing the character of Falstaff until he was persuaded to by director Robert Icke. After Player Kings' run at the Noel Coward theatre, the show will tour the country. It is due to move to the Bristol Hippodrome in July and will also be staged in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle. The play brings together Shakespeare's two history plays (Henry IV, parts 1 and 2) with the cast including Toheen Jimoh as Hal and Richard Coyle as King Henry IV. In April, Sir Ian had to take drastic, and speedy, measures to ensure he made it across London in time for his daily performance of the show - riding on the back of a motorbike. One source said at the time: 'Sir Ian tried getting picked up by a car provided by theatre bosses but it took so long to get across town it was pointless. 'One night it took him 90 minutes to get from his home. After that, it was decided a motorbike was the only option.' He has also previously had to pull out of performances due to injuries. In 2018, he had to apologise to theatre-goers after a leg injury forced him to pull out of a performance of King Lear. Sir Ian had been rushing to catch the train and pulled his calf muscle.\n\nLast September, Sir Ian opened up about his life changing 'overnight' when he came out as gay 35 years ago. Very few people knew of his homosexuality at a young age, including his parents. In 1988, he publicly came out on a BBC Radio 4 programme while discussing Margaret Thatcher's Section 28 legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offence. He said of the law: 'I think it's offensive to anyone who is, like myself, homosexual, apart from the whole business of what can or cannot be taught to children.' Section 28 was eventually fully repealed in 2003. Sir Ian has spoken about his experiences on coming out on several occasions. Back in July 2000, he wrote in The Independent: 'The only good thing I can think to say about Section 28 is that it finally encouraged me to come out. A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.' He told Variety about coming out in 1988: 'Almost overnight everything in my life changed for the better - my relationships with people and my whole attitude toward acting changed.' Sir Ian told how coming out actually had a huge impact on his acting work. He explained: 'The kind of acting that I had been good at was all about disguise - adopting funny voices and odd walks. 'It was about lying to the world. I was no longer in the situation where I was running along beside the character explaining it to the audience. I just became the character.'\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: 'What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.' Ian also said he felt that it was difficult for non-gay people to relate to his struggle. The veteran actor said: 'People who are not gay just simply don't know how it damages you to be lying about what you are and ashamed of yourself. 'I was brought up at a time when it was illegal for me to have sexual intercourse with a man. And that was not that long ago,' he added. He previously revealed how he had to 'swear he wasn't gay' in order to work on Broadway in the 1960s. Just last week, Sir Ian made headlines after he took a swipe at former US president Donald Trump - accusing him of being 'one of the worst public speakers there has ever been'. He told The Times: 'Trump is an absolute bewilderment. I haven't seen him live. But he's one of the worst public speakers there has ever been. Whether he's reading a script or not, it's so patent what he is.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

According to a report by the BBC, the 85-year old thespian -- known for his roles as Gandalf in the \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Hobbit\" film series and Magneto in the \"X-Men\" films, as well as his extensive theatrical experience -- was performing as Falstaff in \"Players King,\" a production that combines Shakespeare's \"Henry IV - Part 1\" and \"Part 2,\" when he lost his footing and fell from the front of the stage.\n\nThough no official injuries have been reported, audience members told the BBC that the experience was \"very shocking\" and that following the fall and house lights being brought back up, McKellen was crying out for help.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\n\"As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance,\" said a theater-goer who was witness to the accident.\n\nThe production opened on the West End back in April for a 12-week run. The incident occurred during a fight scene between characters the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy. McKellen was circling the fight at the time when his foot went off the stage and he fell.\n\nAn official statement from the theater provided to IndieWire reads: \"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of 'Player Kings.' Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits. The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday 18 June so Ian can rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow. Thank you to doctors Rachel and Lee who were on hand in the audience and to all the venue staff for their support.'\"\n\nMcKellen is well-known in London and around the world for his mastering of the Bard, with performances as Iago, Coriolanus, Richard II, Richard III, King Lear and Macbeth. He was also recently in a filmed theatrical production of a modern retelling of \"Hamlet,\" in which he played the title role.\n\nThis is also not the first time McKellen has sustained injuries for his theatrical pursuits. In 2018, after injuring his leg while running to catch a train for his performance, McKellen was forced to cancel a performance of \"King Lear\" at London's Duke of York Theatre. The actor made it up to the audience by replacing the performance with a Q&A in which he answered questions from the stage.\n\nAlong with his acting work, McKellan is known for his tireless activism, supporting multiple LGBTQIA+ organizations, bringing the art of performance to children's hospitals, and raising money for suffering theaters. He has been nominated twice for an Academy Award, five times for a Primetime Emmy, and won 2 Screen Actors Guild awards, as well as a Tony for his role in the 1981 production of \"Amadeus.\"\n\nBest

The 85-year-old actor, currently starring as John Falstaff in Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre, reportedly lost his balance in an intense fight scene.\n\nThe audience was informed that the rest of the evening's performance was cancelled and they were asked to leave the theatre. A BBC journalist, who saw the play, said the veteran stage and screen actor was in a scene involving the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy when he fell off the front of the stage.\n\nAs lights were raised, he was heard crying out, and staff members hurried to assist him. Details on Sir Ian's condition following the incident are yet to be disclosed.\n\nPlayer Kings, which is a take on Henry IV, Parts One and Two, kicked off its 12-week stint in the West End this April.\n\nOK! has contacted Sir Ian's representatives for comment.\n\nConcerned theatre-goers immediately took to X, previously known as Twitter, to express their worries for the esteemed actor, recounting the \"really bad fall\". One person posted: \"Audience shocked by Sir Ian McKellen's fall off stage tonight at Noel Coward Theatre. Staff working hard to help him. Thoughts with him, cast and crew,\" reports the Mirror.\n\nAnother chimed in: \"It was a really bad fall. I hope that he is OK.\" While someone else commented: \"Shocking to watch, it was a terrible fall. Hoping he is not badly injured, he seemed to be in great pain.\"\n\nA different attendee remarked: \"Wasn't sure if it was part of the play. He sounded in a bad way. Hope he's ok.\"\n\nSir Ian, best known for his role as Gandalf in The Lord Of The Rings, has recently ended his relationship with boyfriend Oscar Conlon-Morrey. The pair fell head over heels for each other while working together on a pantomime back in December 2022, where Sir Ian played Mother Goose and Oscar, who is 54 years his junior, played his son Jack.\n\nOscar couldn't contain his excitement about their blossoming romance and took to social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, on New Year's Eve in 2023 to share his happiness. \"I saw in 2023 at the house of the new love of my life,\" he gushed.\n\nSources close to the couple revealed that Sir Ian was equally smitten with the young actor. However, their whirlwind romance came to an end in February when they decided to part ways.\n\nFriends of Sir Ian have always been sceptical about the legendary actor settling down. When the romance between Ian and Oscar first began, a fellow actor expressed his doubts about the relationship's longevity.\n\n\"Oscar has been telling friends and family of his big plans with McKellen. He's even said he thinks they'll get engaged,\" the unnamed actor told the Mail Online. \"McKellen hasn't had a boyfriend in 20 years. He is really not a marriage man.\"\n\n\"He doesn't want a man living in his home. He enjoys having someone when he is on tour. He gets infatuated; then as quickly as he is into them, he's fallen out with them.

Player Kings, a witness told Sky News.\n\nSir Ian McKellen has been forced to cancel two nights of his West End play after suffering a fall during Monday's performance, but fans have been assured he's \"recovering well\".\n\nThe Lord of the Rings actor, 85, is currently starring as John Falstaff in a production of Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre, London.\n\nDuring Monday night's show, he suffered a fall and was taken to hospital for medical treatment.\n\nThis morning, the theatre announced tonight's performance of Player Kings would be cancelled \"so Ian can rest\".\n\nThey initially said the Gandalf star would be back in action for Wednesday's matinee - but that show has now been cancelled too.\n\nThe play will return on Thursday, though a statement posted on X did not specify if Sir Ian or an understudy will be playing Falstaff.\n\n\"We look forward to welcoming audiences back to the Noel Coward Theatre on Thursday 20 June,\" the theatre company said.\n\n\"We are delighted Ian is recovering well, and look forward to him returning to the production as soon as he is ready.\n\n\"We will keep audiences updated regarding remaining performances this week.\"\n\nTicketholders affected by the cancellations will be contacted directly, they added.\n\nMore entertainment news:\n\nJustin Timberlake arrested\n\nInside the UK's music festival crisis\n\nThe Player Kings website lists David Semark, whose credits include EastEnders and Holby City, as the 'cover' actor for Sir Ian's leading role.\n\nThe veteran actor cried out in pain when he lost his footing and fell during a fight scene in Monday's production, a witness told Sky News.\n\n\"He still had his microphone on and could be heard shouting for help as some stagehands came out and then started instructing everyone to leave as they brought a stretcher on,\" they said.\n\n\"We were evacuated to the street and after 10-15 minutes were told that the show could not resume and we would be refunded, and that an ambulance was on the way for Sir Ian.\"\n\nThe Noel Coward Theatre shared an update on Sir Ian's condition just before midnight.\n\nThey said in a post on X: \"Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\"\n\nPlayer Kings is a production of William Shakespeare's Henry IV parts one and two, adapted and directed by

The way the stage works at the Noel Coward, there's a step down and that's where the stage meets the audience.\n\n\"I think what happened is he took his foot too far off that initial step and lost his balance and went headfirst into the audience. Within seconds, a blood curling stream arose from the actor and he was clearly in a lot of pain and screaming 'help me.'\"\n\nAudience members also took to X, formerly Twitter, with their recollection of the night. One said: \"Just witnessed Ian Mckellan severely injure himself after falling off stage at Noel Coward Theatre.

Sir Ian was involved in a battle scene with the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy when he fell off the front of the stage. As the house lights came up, the actor cried out in pain and staff rushed to his aid.\n\nThe audience was then swiftly evacuated from the theatre and informed that the rest of the evening's performance would be cancelled. Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter after the incident to share their concern for the legendary actor one fan described it as a \"really bad fall\".\n\n\"Just witnessed Ian Mckellan severely injure himself after falling off stage at Noel Coward Theatre. Sir Ian could be heard screaming in pain as ushers rushed to his aid. Show cancelled as he is treated by ambulance crews. Wish him all the best,\" another audience memeber wrote.\n\nOne user shared: \"Audience shocked by Sir Ian McKellen's fall off stage tonight at Noel Coward Theatre. Staff working hard to help him. Thoughts with him, cast and crew.\" Someone else replied: \"It was a really bad fall. I hope that he is OK.\" Another added: \"Shocking to watch, it was a terrible fall. Hoping he is not badly injured, he seemed to be in great pain.\" Another audience member shared: \"Wasn't sure if it was part of the play. He sounded in a bad way. Hope he's ok.\" While another echoed: \"It was very shocking indeed. Praying he is OK.\"\n\nThere has been no update on the extent of Sir Ian's injuries just yet. The Mirror has contacted Ian's representatives for comment on this story.\n\nThe Lord Of The Rings icon had recently split from his boyfriend following a year-long romance. He fell for Oscar Conlon-Morrey, 30, when they worked together in a pantomime back in December 2022. In the show, Sir Ian played Mother Goose while Oscar, who is 54 years his junior, portrayed his son Jack.\n\nOscar was quick to tell the world of his joyous new relationship on New Year's Eve in 2023 when he gushed over his romance with the acting legend. \"I saw in 2023 at the house of the new love of my life,\" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Ian was also said to be smitten with the young actor. However, their relationship ended in February with the pair calling it quits on their whirlwind romance.\n\nIan's close friends have always doubted that the legendary actor would ever settle down. At the beginning of Ian and Oscar's romance, one well-known actor opened up about the doubts he harboured about Ian's relationship. The unnamed actor told MailOnline at the time: \"Oscar has been telling friends and family of his big plans with McKellen. He's even said he thinks they'll get engaged.\"\n\nCasting doubt on the plans, they added: \"McKellen hasn't had a boyfriend in 20 years. He is really not a marriage man. He doesn't want a man living in his home. He enjoys having someone when he is on tour. He gets infatuated; then as quickly as he is into them, he's fallen out with them. There is no way when he is out of the bubble of doing this panto that he is going to have this guy with him in East London, rattling around,\" he added.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads\n\nDo you have a story to sell?

It's not yet known if the Lord of the Rings actor sustained injuries from the accident.\n\nMcKellen, 85, was performing a fight scene when he lost balance and fell off the stage, according to BBC. McKellen plays John Falstaff in the play, which is made up of Shakespeare's Henry IV, Parts One and Two. McKellen was reportedly circling the fight scene involving two other players when he fell off the stage. The house lights came up and McKellen reportedly called out for help. The evening performance was canceled and the audience was evacuated from the theater.\n\nAn audience member told BBC that, \"As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance.\" They said the moment was \"very shocking.\"\n\nPlayer Kings opened in April in the West End and is set for a 12-week run. In addition to McKellen, the cast includes Ted Lasso's Toheeb Jimoh and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina's Richard Coyle, seen above with McKellen on stage during an early performance.\n\nRelatedRory Kinnear to Play Tom Bombadil in 'The Rings of Power' Season 2\n\nMcKellen has many Shakespeare plays on his resume, one of the more recent credits being a production of King Lear in 2018. A performance once had to be canceled after McKellen injured his leg during a fall as he tried to catch a train. He participated in an audience Q&A instead of performing the show that day for the sake of the audience.\n\nMcKellen is best known for playing Gandalf in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, as well as playing Magneto in the X-Men franchise and his prolific stage career. He's a two-time Oscar nominee, having received his first nomination for Best Actor in 1999's Gods and Monsters and his second for Best Supporting Actor in 2002's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.

It's not yet known if the Lord of the Rings actor sustained injuries from the accident.\n\nMcKellen, 85, was performing a fight scene when he lost balance and fell off the stage, according to BBC. McKellen plays John Falstaff in the play, which is made up of Shakespeare's Henry IV, Parts One and Two. McKellen was reportedly circling the fight scene involving two other players when he fell off the stage. The house lights came up and McKellen reportedly called out for help. The evening performance was canceled and the audience was evacuated from the theater.\n\nAn audience member told BBC that, \"As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance.\" They said the moment was \"very shocking.\"\n\nPlayer Kings opened in April in the West End and is set for a 12-week run. In addition to McKellen, the cast includes Ted Lasso's Toheeb Jimoh and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina's Richard Coyle, seen above with McKellen on stage during an early performance.\n\nRelatedRory Kinnear to Play Tom Bombadil in 'The Rings of Power' Season 2 More from this section The Suspicious Timing Of Kate Middleton's Trooping The Colour Health Update 10 Things to Know about the Doomsday Killer Mistakes Everyone Makes When Cooking Meatballs\n\nMcKellen has many Shakespeare plays on his resume, one of the more recent credits being a production of King Lear in 2018. A performance once had to be canceled after McKellen injured his leg during a fall as he tried to catch a train. He participated in an audience Q&A instead of performing the show that day for the sake of the audience.\n\nMcKellen is best known for playing Gandalf in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, as well as playing Magneto in the X-Men franchise and his prolific stage career. He's a two-time Oscar nominee, having received his first nomination for Best Actor in 1999's Gods and Monsters and his second for Best Supporting Actor in 2002's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. He's a five-time Emmy nominee.\n\nMore Headlines:\n\nJohn Early on Hitting Donna Summer's High Notes & 'Now More Than Ever' References (VIDEO)Ian McKellen Hospitalized After Falling Off Stage During

A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nSir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, is currently performing in Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, at

On Tuesday, the legendary actor took to social media to confirm that he is being treated for injuries sustained by the ordeal, and that he will make a \"complete and speedy\" recovery. McKellen's fall occurred during a Monday performance of Player Kings, after the actor lost his footing and fell off of the front of the stage while performing a fight scene. The audience of Player Kings was subsequently evacuated following McKellen's accident, with the day's evening performance also cancelled.\n\n\"I want to thank everyone for their kind messages and support,\" McKellen's post reads. \"Since the accident, during a performance of Player Kings last night, my injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service.

In a 2023 interview, McKellen flat-out debunked the possibility, arguing that he wants to \"carry on\" in the industry while he is still healthy and able to.\n\n\"Retire to do what?\" McKellen said at the time. \"I've never been out of work, but I'm aware that any minute now something could happen to me which could prevent me from ever working again.

With Andy Serkis confirmed to direct and reprise his role as Gollum, speculation has swirled over whether or not some of the other Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit cast members would return for the movie as well. When asked about the possibility of reprising his role as Gandalf, McKellen indicated that he would if he's still \"alive.\"\n\n\"But here is no script, there is no offer, there is no plan.\" McKellen added.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West End theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Serkis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Serkis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gandalf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gollum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gollum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hobbit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/06/18/7926f442-53e5-4fb2-b64a-99e34f1eff2c/ian-mckellen-getty-images-2019.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

With a career spanning over 60 years, it's a miracle his face is not on the flag. The renowned English actor is just as prolific on the stage as he is on the screen. These days, you'll find him in London, with a major role in Player's King on the stage.\n\nHowever, the beloved treasure recently suffered a minor setback while performing, which landed him in the hospital. Naturally, this has got fans wondering if he's doing well, and what exactly led to his admission. Here's the tea (pun intended) on just what happened!\n\nThe 85-year icon had an unfortunate accident while performing Players King, a Henry IV production on the stage. McKellen plays the role of John Falstaff, and has been performing the play without incident since it kicked off its 12-week West End run in April, 2024.\n\nHowever, the accident happened on June 17 at the No\u00ebl Coward theater in London. During a fight scene between McKellen's character, the Prince of Wales, and Henry Percy, the actor lost his footing and tripped off the front of the stage. Audience members report hearing him cry for help after the fall as the theater was immediately evacuated and the lights turned on.\n\nAccording to audience testimonies, McKellen seemed to lose his footing and trip as he moved down the stage during the scene. Some even believed that it was part of the performance until they heard him cry out in pain. Crew members immediately rushed to assist McKellen following the fall. As aforementioned, the performance was quickly halted, and McKellen was swiftly rushed to the hospital.\n\nFollowing his fall, a statement from the producers of the play confirmed that doctors at the NHS expected McKellen to make a \"speedy and full recovery\" after receiving a scan. They thanked fans and audiences for their well wishes and confirmed that audience members affected by the cancellations will be contacted to sort out payment issues.\n\nHowever, following the cancellation of Monday night's performance, Tuesday night's performance has also been canceled to give the actor enough time to rest. Thankfully, Ian McKellen is expected to return to the stage to continue his role in Players King on Wednesday, June 18 for a matinee performance. Looks like nothing can keep the great veteran down for too long.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "demi_phillips@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Demi Phillips", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Falstaff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Falstaff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Percy_(Hotspur)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry Percy (Hotspur)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West End theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Busking_and_Street_Performing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Busking and Street Performing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2147987299-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 1044, "textEnd": 1051}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2384, "textEnd": 2391}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

They have now confirmed Wednesday night has also been axed.\n\nIn a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter, the production said he is 'recovering well' and that they 'look forward to him returning to the production as soon as he is ready'.\n\n'The performance on Wednesday 19 June will be cancelled following Ian McKellen's fall during the performance of Player Kings on Monday (17 June)', the statement said.\n\n'Bookers for the affected performance will be contacted by their point of purchase directly. We look forward to welcoming audiences back to the Noel Coward Theatre on Thursday 20 June.\n\n'We are delighted that Ian is recovering well, and look forward to him returning to the production as soon as he is ready. We will keep audiences updates regarding remaining performances this week.'\n\nAudience members told MailOnline the star plunged off the front of the stage in a 'belly flop fashion' and yelled 'help me... my arms' just before the interval of Player Kings.\n\nThe crowd were evacuated from the theatre at around 8pm last night while medics were called to the venue - and ticket holders were told the evening show had been cancelled.\n\nSir Ian was circling a battle scene involving the Prince of Wales and Henry Percy, when he tripped and fell off the stage.\n\nAs the house lights came up, the actor known for Lord Of The Rings and X-Men cried out in pain as ushers and two medics in the audience rushed to help him.\n\nCharlie Johnson, a journalist for the Kingston Courier who was in the audience, told ITV: 'As we approached the interval of the play, there was a fight scene going on.\n\n'There were strobe lights and then it all went dark, at which point you could see the silhouette of Sir Ian come out from the wings. And the way the stage works at the Noel Coward is there's sort of a step down just as the stage meets the audience.\n\n'I think what happened was he put his foot too far, sort of went off that initial step, at which point he lost his balance and pretty much just went head first into the audience.\n\n'And within seconds a blood-curdling scream arose from the actor. He was clearly in a lot of pain, he was screaming 'help me'.'\n\nKol Baker, who was watching the show from the second tier, told MailOnline that Sir Ian had been 'berating the villain and moving around' during the scene when he 'tripped over' some props and fell off the stage 'in almost a belly flop fashion'.\n\n'Instantly he screamed and honestly the noises were bone-chilling,' the 23-year-old added - as he recalled Sir Ian yelling 'help me, help me' followed by 'my arms, my arms' and 'help me, help me' again.\n\n'The lights were on so quickly the curtains drawn and within seconds they asked to evacuate the whole auditorium. Whilst leaving the theatre within ten minutes he was in the back of an ambulance speeding down Trafalgar Square.'\n\nDescribing what caused the actor to fall, he explained: 'The scene in question was a warzone so there was broken up bricks and daggers from the battle and the set which was all torn up for that scene.'\n\nHe said there was 'so much concern and shock for Sir Ian', adding: 'Everyone I think is just such huge fans of his work and just really empathetic and almost terrified that it could be life-threatening because of his age.'\n\nMr Baker said that Sir Ian had been 'performing amazingly with great vigour' before he fell.\n\nWhen asked how the audience reacted, the theatregoer added: 'Instantly people were standing up, the first two rows completely went to rush to go help Sir Ian and everyone was explaining 'oh my god' and 'that poor man'.\n\n'It was very sincere and so much concern for his well-being,' he added. 'He had made everyone laugh so much this evening.'\n\nPlayer Kings, which started its 12-week West End run in April, is a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two.\n\nAfterwards, the show will tour the country. It is due to move to the Bristol Hippodrome in July and will also be staged in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.\n\nSir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, was born in Burnley, Lancashire, in 1939 and, alongside his sister Jean, was raised by his mother Margery and his father Denis.\n\nHe has often credited his parents for encouraging his interest in becoming a performer, previously claiming in a 2017 interview with the Irish Examiner: 'Apparently she said, 'If Ian decides to be an actor, it's a good job, because it brings pleasure to people'.'\n\nHis mother died when he was just 12 and he would lose his father at the age of 22.\n\nSir Ian acted at all the schools he attended. When at Bolton School he was able to take on his first Shakespeare performance at Hopefield Miniature Theatre when, as a 13-year-old Malvolio, he performed the letter scene from Twelfth Night.\n\nHe then won a scholarship to read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge and was soon appearing in regular productions, including appearing alongside now famous alumni such as Derek Jacobi, David Frost and Margaret Drabble.\n\nBy the time Sir Ian graduated in 1961 he had decided to become an actor, and landed his first job in a production of A Man For All Seasons at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry.\n\nSince then, he has gone on to become a household name for his acclaimed performances in everything from Shakespearean tragedies to Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nHe shot to international acclaim for his film work, receiving an Academy Award nomination in 1998 for Best Actor after he starred in Gods and Monsters.\n\nIn 2019, the actor topped the The Stage 100 list of most influential people in British Theatre following his UK Tour of Ian McKellen on Stage.\n\nSir Ian was knighted in 1991 for services to theatre and was later appointed a Companion of Honour for services to drama and equality by Queen Elizabeth II in 2008.\n\nSir Ian has been nominated for 12 Olivier Awards and won six for his roles in Pillars Of The Community, The Alchemist, Bent, Wild Honey, Richard III and his one-man show Ian McKellen On Stage", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The 85-year-old acting legend, who is due to appear in Bristol next month, lost his footing during an intense fight scene and fell off the stage at London's Noel Coward Theatre on Monday (June 17).\n\nThe audience was quickly evacuated from the theatre and informed that the evening's performance would be cancelled. A shocked audience member reportedly heard Sir Ian cry out: \"Help me, help me\" after the fall.\n\nThe actor then repeated 'My arms, my arms' and 'Help me, help me'. Last night, it was reported that Sir Ian was \"in good spirits\" and expected to make a swift recovery - thanks to the \"brilliant\" NHS.\n\nREAD MORE: Everything you need to know as Kings of Leon perform in Bristol\n\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift Eras tour: Fans start queuing at midnight ahead of Cardiff show\n\nPlayer Kings, adapted and directed by Robert Icke, is set to take the stage at the Bristol Hippodrome from July 3-6. A spokesperson from the show said: \"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings.\n\n\"Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits. The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday 18 June so Ian can rest. Thank you to doctors Rachel and Lee who were on hand in the audience and to all the venue staff for their support.\"\n\nSir Ian is set to make his next appearance in Wednesday's matinee performance of the production. Player Kings, a rendition of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, kicked off its 12-week West End run in April.\n\nSign up to receive our What's On in Bristol newsletter for all the latest on things to do and places to eat.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, eyewitness Charlie Johnson shared his account of the shocking incident on Good Morning Britain. He said: \"As we approached the interval of the play, there was a fight scene going on and there were strobe light and then it all went dark, at which point you could see the silhouette of Sir Ian come out the wings and the way the stage works at the Noel Coward, there's a step-down and where the stage meets the audience.\n\n\"I think what happened is he took his foot too far off that initial step and lost his balance and went head first into the audience. Within seconds, a blood curling scream arose from the actor and he was clearly in a lot of pain and screaming 'help me'.\"\n\nLooking for places to visit and things to do in Bristol?

I watched the actor play Falstaff in The Player Kings in April, and the scene in question is one of the most pivotal parts of the production.\n\nI was beyond ecstatic when I was given tickets as a Christmas present, here was my chance to see McKellen play one of the most important roles in Shakespeare. Falstaff is one of the playwright's most beloved characters: a buffoonish, boastful, hilarious old man whose friendship with Prince Hal is the backbone of Henry IV Part 1 and 2.\n\nIt is a part that all actors interested in Shakespeare long to play when they get to the right stage of their life, and McKellen certainly didn't disappoint. His Falstaff is everything you want the character to be, a bumbling drunkard and sly-talker who you can't help but be drawn to whenever he is on stage.\n\nAudiences laugh with him, and they laugh at him. The character is a terrible influence on Prince Hal (played brilliantly by Toheeb Jimoh) but you also find their bond endearing. Their pseudo-toxic friendship is what makes Henry IV Part 1 so fun, and McKellen's brash, chaotic take only adds to the comedy.\n\nRead more: Sir Ian McKellen to 'make a speedy and full recovery' after theatre stage fall (PA Media, 3-min read)\n\nBut one of the most important parts of the play comes when the war between King Henry IV and rebels led by Henry \"Hotspur\" Percy breaks out, leading to the scene where McKellen is said to have fallen.\n\nThe Player Kings is a modern retelling of Shakespeare's plays and I was mesmerised as the battle, cast members in camouflage stormed the stage, explosions went off and rubble (no doubt made of rubber) was scattered across the boards to make the scene feel realistic.\n\nAfter the first half mostly bounced back and forth between taverns and the royal court, it felt like a nice change of pace, and what made it all the more interesting is, of course, the part that Falstaff plays in the battle.\n\nThe knight finds himself lifted in station to battalion leader, but when the Battle of Shrewsbury reaches its peak he fakes his death to avoid attack. He witnesses Hal and Hotspur's duel, and when Hotspur is slain decides to have his moment of glory by stabbing Hotspur and taking credit for killing him.\n\nRead more: Ian McKellen will return for new Lord of the Rings movie if he's alive (Digital Spy, 2-min read)\n\nThe scene is one of the most important of the production, and McKellen delivers a powerful monologue that encompasses everything you love about -- and get frustrated by -- Falstaff. Here is an actor who commands the stage, who can hold the audience's attention with his every word.\n\nI was utterly captivated by McKellen as he gave the speech, making his way across the stage to deliver the \"final\" blow to Hotspur. It's funny and emotional, and represents everything that I love best about seeing McKellen on stage, and it has to be seen to be believed.\n\nPlayer Kings will be performed at the Noel Coward Theatre until Saturday, 22 June, it will then go on tour in Bristol, Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [],

McKellen is playing John Falstaff in Player Kings.\n\nDuring the health and news segment, Kelly said the news that the actor had fallen off the stage was \"disturbing\" while holding a conversation with Dr Hilary. Also, the TV host had praise for the acting legend as she sent him her well wishes on her daytime TV show.\n\nKelly: \"This is disturbing. Ian McKellen, when he was on stage, had a bad fall didn't he? He was rushed to hospital.\"\n\nDr Hilary said: \"Belly-flopped apparently. Fell of the stage. Belly-flopped to the floor. Rushed to hospital presumably a precautionary measure. They say he's going to be back next Wednesday. Bruising can take awhile to come out. We wish him well. What a drama.\"\n\nKelly added: \"Thank goodness he is so well and so fit.\"\n\nDr Hilary however shared his concerns because of McKellen's age. He said: \"He's 85. A fall at 85 is potentially quite serious.\"\n\nKelly celebrated the actor for his attitude of \"the show must go on\" and for being a \"total trooper\". She said: \"I know it's not good. But you know what he's like, a total trooper, the show must go on, he's probably sitting this morning in his hospital bed - or hopefully he's back home - we're sending you all our love. We will keep you updated as we hear how he's getting on. Everybody is talking about this, he's so well loved.\"\n\nLater on This Morning, Cat Deeley and Ben Shephard also sent their well wishes to the actor who recently joined them on the sofa. Shephard said: \"We just want to say we are sending lots of love to Sir Ian who fell off the stage last night. He's doing well... Get well soon from all of us.\"\n\nDoctors have reassured everyone that McKellen will make a \"speedy and full recovery\" after a scan at the hospital, the theatre said. The star is expected to return to the stage for Wednesday's matinee performance.\n\nA spokesperson for the theatre said: \"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings.\n\n\"Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\n\n\"The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday June 18 so Ian can rest.

His current condition remains unknown.\n\nPer the BBC, McKellen was doing a performance of Player Kings at the No\u00ebl Coward theater in London when the incident occurred. He was taking part in a fight scene when he reportedly lost his footing and fell off the front of the stage. The house lights came up and McKellen called for help, at which point he was rushed to the hospital for treatment. No updates have since been made about the extent of his injuries.\n\nRelated\n\nX-Men: The Last Stand's Biggest Twist Was Never Explained\n\nThe X-Men films leave many questions unanswered, but one unexplained mystery stands out: how did one character return after dying in The Last Stand?\n\nClose\n\nAccording to the report, the audience was evacuated after McKellen's fall and a planned evening show had been canceled. The show, meant to consist of a 12-week run, started in April. It features McKellen in the role of John Falstaff, coming as the latest Shakespearean play to feature the actor. He's also set to play Hamlet in a new movie and previously portrayed other Shakespearean roles like Richard II, Coriolanus, Iago, Richard III, King Lear, and Macbeth.\n\n\"I really hope that he is going to be alright,\" says Sandro Trapani, who was present during the show when McKellen fell. \"As far as I saw, he was conscious because he was asking for assistance.\"\n\nRelated\n\nX-Men Artist Discusses \"Redefining\" One of Marvel's Most Iconic Mutants\n\nIndustry icon Ryan Stegman opens up about \"redefining\" one of the greatest mutant heroes of all time in his upcoming X-Men run.\n\nMcKellen was once injured ahead of a King Lear showing in 2019. He'd hurt his leg while rushing to board a train, though he still attended to entertain the audience as best he could. The actor sat on stage and answered questions.\n\nWill Ian McKellen Return as Magneto or Gandalf?\n\nA veteran actor, McKellen is known in part for his roles in the Lord of the Rings and X-Men franchises. He could potentially be revisiting either one of his roles as Gandalf or Magneto as well. With the latter, a variety of X-Men characters have been making multiverse cameos in MCU projects, so the door seems to be open for McKellen to return as Magneto. That might even happen in Deadpool & Wolverine, the new film coming this summer that is rumored to feature many exciting cameos, and McKellen's potential comeback would certainly fit the bill.\n\nAndy Serkis directing a new Lord of the Rings film could also mean that Gandalf could make an appearance with McKellen in the role. However, the 85-year-old actor joked that if producer Peter Jackson wants that to happen, then the new movie should be made sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I haven't shaved in months,\" McKellen said of how his Flagstaff role already has him looking like Gandalf, per The Times. \"There is no script, there is no offer, there is no plan.

Wednesday's performance of the West End show Player Kings has been cancelled. In a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter, the production said he is \"recovering well\" and that they \"look forward to him returning to the production as soon as he is ready\".\n\n\"The performance on Wednesday 19 June will be cancelled following Ian McKellen's fall during the performance of Player Kings on Monday (17 June)\", the statement said. \"Bookers for the affected performance will be contacted by their point of purchase directly. We look forward to welcoming audiences back to the Noel Coward Theatre on Thursday 20 June.\n\n\"We are delighted that Ian is recovering well, and look forward to him returning to the production as soon as he is ready. We will keep audiences updates regarding remaining performances this week.\" Sir Ian lost his footing during an intense fight scene in a performance of Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre in London on Monday night and was rushed to hospital.\n\nHe reportedly let out a \"blood-curdling scream\" and pleaded: \"Help me.\" No serious harm appears to have been done to the Lord of the Rings star, who played Gandalf in the film franchise. Updating fans on Sir Ian's health, a spokesperson for the London theatre said: \"Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\n\n\"The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday June 18 so Ian can rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow.\" The statement also thanked doctors Rachel and Lee who were \"on hand in the audience\" and to the venue staff \"for their support\".\n\nThe audience were evacuated from the theatre on Monday and informed the show would be cancelled. Charlie Johnson, who witnessed the incident, spoke to Good Morning Britain about the impact of Sir Ian's fall. He explained: \"As we approached the interval of the play, there was a fight scene going on and there were strobe lights and then it all went dark; at which point you could see the silhouette of Sir Ian come out the wings. The way the stage works at the Noel Coward, there's a step down and that's where the stage meets the audience.\n\n\"I think what happened is he took his foot too far off that initial step and lost his balance and went headfirst into the audience. Within seconds, a blood curling stream arose from the actor and he was clearly in a lot of pain and screaming 'help me.'\" Other audience members shared their experience on X. One said: \"Audience shocked by Sir Ian McKellen's fall off stage on Monday evening at Noel Coward Theatre. Staff working hard to help him. Thoughts with him, cast and crew.\" Another added: \"Shocking to watch, it was a terrible fall. Hoping he is not badly injured, he seemed to be in great pain.\"\n\nThis is a breaking showbiz news story.

He lost his footing during an intense fight scene and took a fall after reportedly missing a step.\n\nPeople were then swiftly evacuated from the theatre and informed that the evening's performance would be cancelled. A spokesperson for the theatre later confirmed to The Mirror that the performance on Tuesday, 18 June would be axed so that Sir Ian could focus on his recovery.\n\nThey said: \"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings. Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\n\n\"The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday 18 June so Ian can rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow. Thank you to doctors Rachel and Lee who were on hand in the audience and to all the venue staff for their support.\"\n\nThe Lord of the Rings star theatre legend is expected to appear next in Wednesday's matinee performance of the production. Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, began its 12-week West End run in April.\n\nMeanwhile, an audience member appeared on Good Morning Britain and revealed he believes Sir Ian 'took his foot too far off a step' and 'lost his balance'. Speaking to Susanna Reid, Charlie Johnson said: \"As we approached the interval of the play, there was a fight scene going on and there were strobe lights and then it all went dark, at which point you could see the silhouette of Sir Ian come out the wings and the way the stage works at the Noel Coward, there's a step-down and where the stage meets the audience, I think what happened is he took his foot too far off that initial step and lost his balance and went head first into the audience.\n\n\"Within seconds, a blood-curling stream arose from the actor and he was clearly in a lot of pain and screaming 'help me'.\" Host Susanna answered: \"We wish him the very best and he recovers from the accident.

Sir Ian was rushed to hospital but is said to be in good spirits and will be back on stage on Wednesday for a matinee performance of the play.\n\nAn eyewitness, Charlie Johnson, spoke to Good Morning Britain about the shock fall, revealing exactly what happened which led to Ian's fall. He explained: As we approached the interval of the play, there was a fight scene going on and there were strobe light and then it all went dark, at which point you could see the silhouette of Sir Ian come out the wings and the way the stage works at the Noel Coward, there's a step down and where the stage meets the audience.\n\n\"I think what happened is he took his foot too far off that initial step and lost his balance and went head first into the audience. Within seconds, a blood curling stream arose from the actor and he was clearly in a lot of pain and screaming 'help me.'\"\n\nSusanna Reid, who was fronting the show alongside Ed Balls, sent her well wishes. She said: \"We wish him the very best and he recovers from the accident. I think it's amazing he's still doing fight scenes on stage at 85. We wish him all the very best.\"\n\nThe theatre have confirmed that tonight's performance will be cancelled, as they thanked those who stepped in to help.\n\nA spokesperson for the theatre told The Mirror : \"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings. Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits. The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday 18 June so Ian can rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow.

A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nA commanding on-screen actor, McKellen has been widely acclaimed for roles including Bill Kraus in And The Band Played On about the AIDS epidemic, which earned him his first Emmy nod in 1994.\n\nHis role as Tsar Nicholas II in Rasputin won him a Golden Globe in 1997, as well as another Emmy nomination.\n\nHis West End stage credits include No Man's Land, Figures Of Speech, King Lear and Mother Goose, while he also starred in Broadway shows including Amadeus - which scored him a Tony award - Wild Honey and the revival of Waiting For Godot.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type":

To them, of course, I am hugely indebted.\n\n\"They have assured me that my recovery will be complete and speedy and I am looking forward to returning to work.\"\n\nSir Ian also thanked two doctors who were in the audience on Monday and tended to him when he fell.\n\nThe actor is said to have lost his footing during a battle scene, falling off the front of the stage, and was heard to cry out in pain.\n\nThe production began its 12-week West End run in April, to rave reviews. In an interview with The Telegraph in February, Sir Ian joked that it was \"ridiculous\" for him to be performing on stage but said: \"Shakespeare is what I've been doing for so long now, it confirms I'm still alive.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anita_singh@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Anita Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understudy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Understudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West End theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toheeb_Jimoh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toheeb Jimoh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Falstaff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Falstaff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Performance_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Performance Art", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2024/06/20/TELEMMGLPICT000364940817_17188811012140_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqW5LAbqXSQw_G1yEaLnMlB_4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 1231, "textEnd": 1237}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Since it happened suddenly, everyone assumed it was a part of the act, news reports stated.\n\nEminent actor Ian McKellen has landed in the hospital after suffering from a fall during a performance of 'Player Kings' -- a production of Shakespeare's 'Henry IV' -- at the No l Coward Theater in London on June 17. The English actor, who is most famous for essaying the role of 'Gandalf' in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, and 'Magneto' in the 'X-Men' series, was in the middle of a fight scene when he lost his footing and fell off the stage mid-performance, news reports state. The audience was immediately evacuated and the 85-year-old was rushed to a hospital. According to a BBC report, McKellen continues to be in \"good spirits\", even though he \"cried out in pain\" and called \"for help\" after the nasty fall.\n\nPer the BBC report, a theatre spokesman said McKellen had had a scan, and medics assured he would \"make a speedy and full recovery\". \"Ian is in good spirits,\" the spokesman purportedly said. The actor is expected to return to the stage this week for a matinee performance. Interestingly, no one seemed to realise that the actor had actually fallen during the scene. Since it happened suddenly, everyone assumed it was a part of the act. It was only after the actor cried out that the staff rushed to his aid, and the audience was asked to evacuate.\n\nAge-related falls can be quite dangerous and elderly people have to be careful, especially if they are in their 70s and 80s. According to UK's National Health Service (NHS), older people are more likely to have a fall because they may have 'balance problems and muscle weakness', 'vision loss', or a 'long-term health condition', like heart disease, dementia, low blood pressure, etc., which can lead to dizziness.\n\nIt should be noted that while not all falls result in serious injuries, there is a lingering risk of broken bones. Additionally, older people ought to be careful because osteoporosis is a common problem.\n\nPer the BBC report, around five years ago, McKellen sustained another injury and was 'forced' to cancel a 'King Lear' showing at London's Duke of York Theatre. He injured his leg while running to catch a train!", "source": {"uri": "thehealthsite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Thehealthsite.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gandalf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muscle weakness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke of York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hypotension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dizziness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Visual impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Osteoporosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King Lear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://st1.thehealthsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ian-McKellen.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 374, "textEnd": 381}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nSir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, is currently performing in Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.", "source": {"uri": "bridportnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bridport and Lyme Regis News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

No matter how tired he was or how ill he felt, Sir Ian was always there,\" Weston writes.\n\n\"He is of the old school of actors who pride themselves on never missing a performance. A vanishing breed.\"\n\nMcKellen, 85, is currently playing John Falstaff in Player Kings, a production of William Shakespeare's Henry IV, at the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings star slipped and fell from the stage while enacting a fight scene and was taken to hospital.\n\nMcKellen updated fans about his condition on Tuesday. \"I want to thank everyone for their kind messages and support,\" he said via his publicist Clair Dobbs.\n\n\"Since the accident, during a performance of Player Kings last night, my injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service. To them, of course, I am hugely indebted. They have assured me that my recovery will be complete and speedy and I am looking forward to returning to work.\"\n\nWeston, whose book Covering McKellen: An Understudy's Tale won the 2012 Theatre Book Prize, went on to describe the specific scene in which McKellen was injured, explaining how it has caused injuries to other actors, including himself.\n\n\"There must be something about that scene. Not only has Sir Ian been injured in it, but in 1961 that fine actor Tony Britton was playing Hotspur at the Old Vic in London, and was conveyed to St Thomas's hospital in full armour having suffered a severe head wound when Prince Hal mistimed a swipe to his head. He bore the scar on his forehead to his dying day,\" he wrote.\n\n\"My Prince Hal lunged at me, I parried with my dagger, swung round and found myself hurtling off the slippery metal stage on to the ancient stones five feet below.\n\n\"I fell on to a rock, still holding my sword tightly in my left hand, and broke my wrist.\"\n\nWeston described the physical demands of doing theatre and highlighted how the challenges intensify for ageing actors as they contend with learning lines, struggling with physical movements like kneeling as well as deteriorating vision and hearing.\n\n\"The craft becomes increasingly difficult for ageing actors. The lines become more difficult to learn, the dread of drying on stage can affect the greatest of actors, although I've never suffered it myself.\n\n\"Shakespeare becomes impossible unless you're playing the king: you spend so much time on your knees and have nothing to grab hold of to help you get up. Your eyesight goes. You find it hard to see steps or the edges of things.\n\n\"You become slightly deaf and have difficulty hearing your cues, especially from young actors who don't project like they did in your youth.\"\n\nIn a statement to The Independent, a representative for Player Kings said: \"Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ian's fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings.\n\n\"Following a scan, the brilliant NHS team have assured us that he will make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in good spirits.\n\n\"The production has made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday 18 June so Ian can rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow.\"\n\nPlayer Kings is due to move to the Bristol Hippodrome in July and will also be staged in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shahana_yasmin@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Shahana Yasmin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understudy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Understudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Falstaff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Falstaff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weston_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Weston (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King Lear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry V of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas'_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Thomas' Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Vic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Old Vic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Hippodrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bristol Hippodrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/1988aa1e020bf73001d74b9c1a213c42", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 3506, "textEnd": 3513}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

An audience member explained that they believed that he was going to be okay in the long run.

A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nSir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, is currently performing in Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, at

A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nSir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, is currently performing in Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nMcKellen, who now lives in Limehouse, is currently performing in Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

More info\n\nScenes of tension and concern unfolded after audience members witnessed acting veteran Sir Ian McKellen lose his balance on stage and plunge into the orchestra pit during a turbulent fight scene in the Player Kings' performance at London's Noel Coward Theatre.\n\nPlaying the character of John Falstaff, the 85-year-old legend was engaging in dramatic combat with the characters of Prince of Wales and Henry Percy when he suddenly plummeted off the front of the stage.\n\nWitnesses said the theatre instantly plunged into a tense silence, broken only by the cries of pain from the iconic actor. The theatre quickly clicked into emergency mode and staff members darted to their fallen star.\n\nThe audience - stunned and filled with anxiety - were promptly escorted out of the theatre with news that the rest of the show stood cancelled. In the aftermath of the shocking episode, spectators took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share their thoughts about what they had just seen.\n\nOne audience member unflinchingly described the incident as a \"really bad fall\".\n\nAnother viewer, still under the shock of the spectacle unfailingly recounted: \"Just witnessed Ian McKellan severely injure himself after falling off stage at Noel Coward Theatre. Sir Ian could be heard screaming in pain as ushers rushed to his aid. Show cancelled as he is treated by ambulance crews. Wish him all the best,\" they penned on X, reports the Mirror.\n\nOne of the spectators reflected about the incident: \"Audience shocked by Sir Ian McKellen's fall off stage on Monday evening at Noel Coward Theatre. Staff working hard to help him. Thoughts with him, cast and crew.\"\n\nAnother one chimed in: \"It was a really bad fall. I hope that he is OK.\"\n\nA third observed: \"Shocking to watch, it was a terrible fall. Hoping he is not badly injured, he seemed to be in great pain.\"\n\nYet another audience member shared: \"Wasn't sure if it was part of the play. He sounded in a bad way. Hope he's OK.\"\n\nOne more echoed: \"It was very shocking indeed. Praying he is OK.\"\n\nSo far, there's no update on how serious Sir Ian's injuries might be. His representatives have been contacted for further details.\n\nThe revered actor, known for his role in Lord Of The Rings, recently ended a year-long romance with his boyfriend Oscar Conlon-Morrey, whom he's 54 years senior. They caught each other's eye while both working in a pantomime back in December 2022, where Sir Ian was starring as Mother Goose and Oscar portrayed his son Jack.\n\nOn New Year's Eve in 2023, Oscar couldn't contain his excitement about their fledgling relationship, gushing: \"I saw in 2023 at the house of the new love of my life,\" posted on his X account (formerly known as Twitter). According to sources close to them, Sir Ian was just as besotted with the younger actor.\n\nNonetheless, the romantic storm fizzled out rather quickly, with the couple deciding to end things this past February.\n\nIan's inner circle has long been sceptical about the esteemed actor ever taking the plunge into married life. When Ian and Oscar first became an item, a prominent actor shared his reservations with MailOnline: \"Oscar has been telling friends and family of his big plans with McKellen. He's even said he thinks they'll get engaged.\"\n\nExpressing scepticism about the couple's future, the source continued: \"McKellen hasn't had a boyfriend in 20 years. He is really not a marriage man. He doesn't want a man living in his home. He enjoys having someone when he is on tour. He gets infatuated; then as quickly as he is into them, he's fallen out with them. There is no way when he is out of the bubble of doing this panto that he is going to have this guy with him in East London, rattling around,\" they added.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nDavid Weston, Sir Ian McKellen's former understudy, has opened up about the actor's work ethics and the toll doing theatre can take physically.\n\nIn an essay for The Guardian, he described McKellen's commitment to the job and how he always showed up despite exhaustion or illness.\n\n\"After following him across the world as his understudy in King Lear in 2007, I know his dread of disappointing his audience. No matter how tired he was or how ill he felt, Sir Ian was always there,\" Weston writes.\n\n\"He is of the old school of actors who pride themselves on never missing a performance. A vanishing breed.\"\n\nMcKellen, 85, is currently playing John Falstaff in Player Kings, a production of William Shakespeare's Henry IV, at the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings star slipped and fell from the stage while enacting a fight scene and was taken to hospital.\n\nMcKellen updated fans about his condition on Tuesday. \"I want to thank everyone for their kind messages and support,\" he said via his publicist Clair Dobbs.\n\n\"Since the accident, during a performance of Player Kings last night, my injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service. To them, of course, I am hugely indebted. They have assured me that my recovery will be complete and speedy and I am looking forward to returning to work.\"\n\nWeston, whose book Covering McKellen: An Understudy's Tale won the 2012 Theatre Book Prize, went on to describe the specific scene in which McKellen was injured, explaining how it has caused injuries to other actors, including himself.\n\n\"There must be something about that scene. Not only has Sir Ian been injured in it, but in 1961 that fine actor Tony Britton was playing Hotspur at the Old Vic in London, and was conveyed to St Thomas's hospital in full armour having suffered a severe head wound when Prince Hal mistimed a swipe to his head. He bore the scar on his forehead to his dying day,\" he wrote.\n\n\"My Prince Hal lunged at me, I parried with my dagger, swung round and found myself hurtling off the slippery metal stage on to the ancient stones five feet below.\n\n\"I fell on to a rock, still holding my sword tightly in my left hand, and broke my wrist.\"\n\nWeston described the physical demands of doing theatre and highlighted how the challenges intensify for ageing actors as they contend with learning lines, struggling with physical movements like kneeling as well as deteriorating vision and hearing.\n\n\"The craft becomes increasingly difficult for ageing actors. The lines become more difficult to learn, the dread of drying on stage can affect the greatest of actors, although I've never suffered it myself.\n\n\"Shakespeare becomes impossible unless you're playing the king: you spend so much time on your knees and have nothing to grab hold of to help you get up.

The audience were informed the remainder of the performance had been cancelled and were evacuated from the theatre.\n\nDoctors have said the actor will make a \"speedy and full recovery\" and he is expected to appear in Wednesday's matinee performance of the production. During his career, Sir Ian's biggest role on the big screen may be as Gandalf in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.\n\nREAD MORE: Doctor told mum 'sit down' after son, 2, began to 'fade before her eyes'\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool bakery where generations worked making 'cakes to die for'\n\nThe role won him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor in 2002. It marked his second Oscar nod, having been nominated three years previously for his role as James Whale in Bill Condon's period drama Gods And Monsters.\n\nSir Ian also found mainstream success with his performances as Magneto in the X-Men series and as the title character in the film adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III.\n\nOn stage, Sir Ian has been nominated for 12 Olivier Awards and won six for his roles in Pillars Of The Community, The Alchemist, Bent, Wild Honey, Richard III and his one-man show Ian McKellen On Stage. The actor was born in Burnley, Lancashire, in 1939 and, alongside his sister Jean, was raised by his mother Margery and father Denis.\n\nSir Ian has often credited his parents for encouraging his interest in becoming a performer, previously claiming in a 2017 interview with the Irish Examiner: \"Apparently she [hi mum] said, 'If Ian decides to be an actor, it's a good job, because it brings pleasure to people'.\"\n\nHis mum died when he was just 12 and he would lose his dad at the age of 22. Sir Ian acted at all the schools he attended. When at Bolton School he was able to take on his first Shakespeare performance at Hopefield Miniature Theatre when, as a 13-year-old Malvolio, he performed the letter scene from Twelfth Night.\n\nHe then won a scholarship to read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge and was soon appearing in regular productions, including appearing alongside now famous alumni such as Sir Derek Jacobi, Sir David Frost and Dame Margaret Drabble.\n\nBy the time Sir Ian graduated in 1961 he had decided to become an actor, and landed his first job in a production of A Man For All Seasons at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry.\n\nSince then, he has gone on to become a household name for his acclaimed performances in everything from Shakespearean tragedies to Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nOutside of acting, Sir Ian has been active in the gay rights movement. Very few people knew of his homosexuality at a young age, including his parents.\n\nIn 1988, he publicly came out on a BBC Radio 4 programme while discussing Margaret Thatcher's Section 28 legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offence.\n\nHe said of the law: \"I think it's offensive to anyone who is, like myself, homosexual, apart from the whole business of what can or cannot be taught to children.\"\n\nSection 28 was eventually fully repealed in 2003. Sir Ian has spoken about his experiences on coming out on several occasions. Back in July 2000, he wrote in The Independent: \"The only good thing I can think to say about Section 28 is that it finally encouraged me to come out. A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nA commanding on-screen actor, Sir Ian has been widely acclaimed for roles including Bill Kraus in And The Band Played On about the AIDS epidemic, which earned him his first Emmy nod in 1994.\n\nHis role as Tsar Nicholas II in Rasputin won him a Golden Globe in 1997, as well as another Emmy nomination. His West End stage credits include No Man's Land, Figures Of Speech, King Lear and Mother Goose, while he also starred in Broadway shows including Amadeus which scored him a Tony award Wild Honey and the revival of Waiting For Godot.\n\nIn 1991, Sir Ian was knighted for his services to the performing arts.\n\nDon't miss the biggest and breaking stories by signing up to the Echo Daily newsletter

treasure as he goes back on stage", "body": "Even a fall from the West End stage is not expected to keep 85-year-old Sir Ian McKellen from performing for long who is due back on stage today.\n\nThe British actor has shown little sign of slowing down during his esteemed career, even marking his milestone 80th year with an 80-date nationwide solo tour, with his actual birthday being marked at Bolton's Albert Halls.\n\nWith two Oscar nominations, Sir Ian has gripped audiences both on screen and on stage and is widely considered to be one of the greatest actors of all time.\n\nMost recently, Sir Ian has been seen playing John Falstaff in Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.\n\nDuring Monday's performance, the veteran actor fell from the stage but has since been told he will make a \"speedy and full recovery\" and is expected to appear in Thursday's performance of the production.\n\nSir Ian said he is \"looking forward to returning to work\" as he thanked the NHS staff who cared for him after he fell from a West End stage earlier this week.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, he said he is \"hugely indebted\" to the medical staff who have assured him his recovery will be \"complete and speedy\".\n\n\"I want to thank everyone for their kind messages and support,\" Sir Ian said in the statement posted to X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"Since the accident, during a performance of Player Kings last night, my injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service.\n\n\"To them, of course, I am hugely indebted.\n\n\"They have assured me that my recovery will be complete and speedy and I am looking forward to returning to work.\"\n\nAfter the accident, he was taken to hospital to receive treatment and the remainder of Monday and Tuesday's performances were cancelled to allow him to rest.\n\nSir Ian had been expected to return for Wednesday's matinee performance, but it was announced on Tuesday that the show will now not return until Thursday.Sir Ian celebrates his birthday at the Albert Halls in Bolton\n\nDuring his career, Sir Ian's largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.\n\nThe role won him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor during the 2002 ceremony.\n\nIt marked his second Oscar nod, having been nominated three years previously for his role as James Whale in Bill Condon's period drama Gods And Monsters.\n\nSir Ian also found mainstream success with his performances as Magneto in the X-Men series and as the title character in the film adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III.\n\nSir Ian at Bolton School\n\nOn the stage, Sir Ian has been nominated for 12 Olivier Awards and won six for his roles in Pillars Of The Community, The Alchemist, Bent, Wild Honey, Richard III and his one-man show Ian McKellen On Stage.\n\nThe actor was born in Burnley, Lancashire, in 1939 and, alongside his sister Jean, was raised by his mother Margery and father Denis.\n\nSir Ian has often credited his parents for encouraging his interest in becoming a performer, previously claiming in a 2017 interview with the Irish Examiner: \"Apparently she said, 'If Ian decides to be an actor, it's a good job, because it brings pleasure to people'.\"\n\nHis mother died when he was just 12 and he would lose his father at the age of 22.\n\nSir Ian acted at all the schools he attended.\n\nWhen at Bolton School he was able to take on his first Shakespeare performance at Hopefield Miniature Theatre when, as a 13-year-old Malvolio, he performed the letter scene from Twelfth Night.\n\nHe then won a scholarship to read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge and was soon appearing in regular productions, including appearing alongside now famous alumni such as Sir Derek Jacobi, Sir David Frost and Dame Margaret Drabble.\n\nBy the time Sir Ian graduated in 1961 he had decided to become an actor, and landed his first job in a production of A Man For All Seasons at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry.\n\nSince then, he has gone on to become a household name for his acclaimed performances in everything from Shakespearean tragedies to Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nOutside of acting, Sir Ian has been active in the gay rights movement.\n\nSir Ian\n\nVery few people knew of his homosexuality at a young age, including his parents.\n\nIn 1988, he publicly came out on a BBC Radio 4 programme while discussing Margaret Thatcher's Section 28 legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offence.\n\nHe said of the law: \"I think it's offensive to anyone who is, like myself, homosexual, apart from the whole business of what can or cannot be taught to children.\"\n\nSection 28 was eventually fully repealed in 2003.\n\nSir Ian has spoken about his experiences on coming out on several occasions.\n\nSir Ian at the Albert Halls\n\nBack in July 2000, he wrote in The Independent: \"The only good thing I can think to say about Section 28 is that it finally encouraged me to come out. A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nA commanding on-screen actor, Sir Ian has been widely acclaimed for roles including Bill Kraus in And The Band Played On about the AIDS epidemic, which earned him his first Emmy nod in 1994.\n\nHis role as Tsar Nicholas II in Rasputin won him a Golden Globe in 1997, as well as another Emmy nomination.\n\nHis West End stage credits include No Man's Land, Figures Of Speech, King Lear and Mother Goose, while he also starred in Broadway shows including Amadeus - which scored him a Tony award - Wild Honey and the revival of Waiting For Godot.\n\nIn 1991, Sir Ian was knighted for his services to the performing arts.", "source": {"uri": "theboltonnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bolton News"}, "authors": [],

staff after falling from stage", "body": "Even a fall from the West End stage is not expected to keep 85-year-old Sir Ian McKellen from performing for long as he is due back today (Thursday).\n\nThe Burnley-born actor has shown little sign of slowing down during his esteemed career, even marking his milestone 80th year with an 80-date nationwide solo tour.\n\nWith two Oscar nominations, Sir Ian has gripped audiences both on screen and on stage and is widely considered to be one of the greatest actors of all time.\n\nMost recently, Sir Ian has been seen playing John Falstaff in Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.\n\nDuring Monday's performance, the veteran actor fell from the stage but has since been told he will make a \"speedy and full recovery\" and is expected to appear in Thursday's performance of the production.\n\nSir Ian said he is \"looking forward to returning to work\" as he thanked the NHS staff who cared for him after the tumble.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, he said he is \"hugely indebted\" to the medical staff who have assured him his recovery will be \"complete and speedy\".\n\n\"I want to thank everyone for their kind messages and support,\" Sir Ian said in the statement posted to X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"Since the accident, during a performance of Player Kings, my injuries have been diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service.\n\n\"To them, of course, I am hugely indebted.\n\n\"They have assured me that my recovery will be complete and speedy and I am looking forward to returning to work.\"\n\nAfter the accident, he was taken to hospital to receive treatment and the remainder of Monday and Tuesday's performances were cancelled to allow him to rest.\n\nSir Ian had been expected to return for Wednesday's matinee performance, but it was announced on Tuesday that the show would not return until Thursday.Sir Ian celebrates his birthday at the Albert Halls in Bolton\n\nDuring his career, Sir Ian's largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.\n\nThe role won him an Oscar nomination for best-supporting actor during the 2002 ceremony.\n\nIt marked his second Oscar nod, having been nominated three years previously for his role as James Whale in Bill Condon's period drama Gods And Monsters.\n\nSir Ian also found mainstream success with his performances as Magneto in the X-Men series and as the title character in the film adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III.\n\nSir Ian at Bolton School\n\nOn the stage, Sir Ian has been nominated for 12 Olivier Awards and won six for his roles in Pillars Of The Community, The Alchemist, Bent, Wild Honey, Richard III and his one-man show Ian McKellen On Stage.\n\nThe actor was born in Burnley in 1939 and, alongside his sister Jean, was raised by his mother Margery and father Denis.\n\nSir Ian has often credited his parents for encouraging his interest in becoming a performer, previously claiming in a 2017 interview with the Irish Examiner: \"Apparently she said, 'If Ian decides to be an actor, it's a good job, because it brings pleasure to people'.\"\n\nHis mother died when he was just 12 and he lost his father at the age of 22.\n\nSir Ian acted at all the schools he attended.\n\nWhen at Bolton School he was able to take on his first Shakespeare performance at Hopefield Miniature Theatre when, as a 13-year-old Malvolio, he performed the letter scene from Twelfth Night.\n\nHe then won a scholarship to read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge and was soon appearing in regular productions, including appearing alongside now famous alumni such as Sir Derek Jacobi, Sir David Frost and Dame Margaret Drabble.\n\nBy the time Sir Ian graduated in 1961 he had decided to become an actor, and landed his first job in a production of A Man For All Seasons at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry.\n\nSince then, he has gone on to become a household name for his acclaimed performances in everything from Shakespearean tragedies to Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nOutside of acting, Sir Ian has been active in the gay rights movement.\n\nSir Ian\n\nVery few people knew of his homosexuality at a young age, including his parents.\n\nIn 1988, he publicly came out on a BBC Radio 4 programme while discussing Margaret Thatcher's Section 28 legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offence.\n\nHe said of the law: \"I think it's offensive to anyone who is, like myself, homosexual, apart from the whole business of what can or cannot be taught to children.\"\n\nSection 28 was eventually fully repealed in 2003.\n\nSir Ian has spoken about his experiences on coming out on several occasions.\n\nSir Ian at the Albert Halls\n\nBack in July 2000, he wrote in The Independent: \"The only good thing I can think to say about Section 28 is that it finally encouraged me to come out. A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nA commanding on-screen actor, Sir Ian has been widely acclaimed for roles including Bill Kraus in And The Band Played On about the AIDS epidemic, which earned him his first Emmy nod in 1994.\n\nHis role as Tsar Nicholas II in Rasputin won him a Golden Globe in 1997, as well as another Emmy nomination.\n\nHis West End stage credits include No Man's Land, Figures Of Speech, King Lear and Mother Goose, while he also starred in Broadway shows including Amadeus - which scored him a Tony award - Wild Honey and the revival of Waiting For Godot.\n\nIn 1991, Sir Ian was knighted for his services to the performing arts.", "source": {"uri": "lancashiretelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lancashire Telegraph"},

Abrams, before launching his long-running roles as Magneto in 2000's \"X-Men\" and Gandalf in 2001's \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.\"\n\nSir McKellen has won numerous accolades for his work on screen, including the Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2002 and 2004 for his \"The Lord of the Rings\" performances and a Golden Globe in 1997 for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role for the 1996 telefilm \"Rasputin.\"\n\nHe also earned two Tony Awards for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Play -- the first of which he won in 1981 for his portrayal of Antonio Salieri in the 1980 musical \"Amadeus,\" followed by the second, in 1984, for his performance in \"Ian McKellen: Acting Shakespeare.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magneto (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gandalf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West End theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toheeb_Jimoh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toheeb Jimoh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts:_The_Secrets_of_Dumbledore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Lasso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Coyle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Coyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Screen Actors Guild Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(play)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amadeus (play)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Globe Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACTA_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Leading_Role", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Salieri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Salieri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grigori Rasputin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Separation_(play)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Six Degrees of Separation (play)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Sutherland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Fellowship of the Ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

RSS Syndicated Content Published: Tue 18 Jun 2024, 12:15 PM Last updated: Tue 18 Jun 2024, 12:43 PM\n\nBy William Warnes, PA\n\nWith two Oscar nominations for his work on screen and the recipient of every major theatrical award in the UK and US, Sir Ian McKellen is widely considered to be one of the greatest actors of all time.\n\nThe 85-year-old has gripped audiences both on screen and on stage, receiving international acclaim and becoming a household name across the globe.\n\nHis largest mark on the big screen may be as Gandalf in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.\n\nBut he also found mainstream success with his performances as Magneto in the X-Men series and as the title character in the film adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III.\n\nOn the stage, McKellen has been nominated for 12 Olivier Awards and won six for his roles in Pillars Of The Community, The Alchemist, Bent, Wild Honey, Richard III and his one-man show Ian McKellen On Stage.\n\nThe actor was born in Burnley, Lancashire, in 1939 and, alongside his sister Jean, was raised by his mother Margery and father Denis.\n\nMcKellen often credited his parents for encouraging his interest in becoming a performer, previously claiming in a 2017 interview with the Irish Examiner: \"Apparently she said, 'If Ian decides to be an actor, it's a good job, because it brings pleasure to people'.\"\n\nHis mother died when he was just 12, and he would lose his father at the age of 22.\n\nMcKellen acted at all the schools he attended.\n\nWhen at Bolton School he was able to take on his first Shakespeare performance at Hopefield Miniature Theatre when, as a 13-year-old Malvolio, he performed the letter scene from Twelfth Night.\n\nHe then won a scholarship to read English at St Catharine's College, Cambridge and was soon appearing in regular productions, including appearing alongside now famous alumni such as Derek Jacobi, David Frost and Margaret Drabble.\n\nBy the time McKellen graduated in 1961 he had decided to become an actor, and landed his first job in a production of A Man For All Seasons at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry.\n\nSince then, he has gone on to become a household name for his acclaimed performances in everything from Shakespearean tragedies to Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nOutside of acting, McKellen has been active in the gay rights movement.\n\nVery few people knew of his homosexuality at a young age, including his parents.\n\nIn 1988, he publicly came out on a BBC Radio 4 programme while discussing Margaret Thatcher's Section 28 legislation, which made the promotion of homosexuality as a family relationship by local authorities an offence.\n\nHe said of the law: \"I think it's offensive to anyone who is, like myself, homosexual, apart from the whole business of what can or cannot be taught to children.\"\n\nSection 28 was eventually fully repealed in 2003.\n\nMcKellen has spoken about his experiences on coming out on several occasions.\n\nBack in July 2000, he wrote in The Independent: \"The only good thing I can think to say about Section 28 is that it finally encouraged me to come out. A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nMcKellen, who now lives in Limehouse, is currently performing in Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Tue 18 Jun 2024, 12:15 PM Last updated: Tue 18 Jun 2024, 12:43 PM", "source": {"uri": "westmeathindependent.ie", "dataType":

No matter how tired he was or how bad he felt, Sir Ian was always there, Weston writes.\n\nHe belongs to the old school of actors who pride themselves on never missing a performance. A dying breed.\n\nMcKellen, 85, currently plays John Falstaff in Kings of Gamblersa production by William Shakespeare Henry IVat the Nol Coward Theatre.\n\nTHE the Lord of the Rings The star slipped and fell off stage while performing a fight scene and was taken to hospital.\n\nMcKellen updated fans on his condition on Tuesday. I would like to thank everyone for their kind messages and support, he said via his publicist Clair Dobbs.\n\nSince the accident, during a performance of Kings of Gamblers Last night my injuries were diagnosed and treated by a series of experts, specialists and nurses working for the National Health Service. Of course, I owe them a lot. They assured me that my recovery would be full and speedy and I look forward to returning to work.\n\nWeston, whose book McKellen cover: the story of an understudy won the 2012 Theater Book Prize, then described the specific scene in which McKellen was injured, explaining how it caused injuries to other actors, including himself.\n\nThere must be something in this scene. Not only was Sir Ian injured there, but in 1961 the excellent actor Tony Britton was playing Hotspur at the Old Vic in London and was taken to St Thomass Hospital in full armor after suffering a serious head injury when the Prince Hal mistimed a move. at his head. He carried the scar on his forehead until his death, he wrote.\n\nMy prince Hal rushed at me, I parried with my dagger, turned and found myself tumbling down the slippery metal stage onto the ancient stones five feet below.\n\nI fell on a rock, still holding my sword tightly in my left hand, and broke my wrist.\n\nWeston described the physical demands of theater and highlighted how the challenges intensify for aging actors as they deal with learning lines, physical movements like kneeling as well as deteriorating posture. vision and hearing.\n\nThe job becomes more and more difficult for aging actors. Lines become more difficult to learn, the fear of drying out on stage can affect bigger actors, although I've never experienced it myself.\n\nShakespeare becomes impossible unless you play the king: you spend so much time on your knees and have nothing to hold on to to help you get up. Your vision disappears. You have trouble seeing steps or the edges of things.\n\nYou become slightly deaf and have difficulty hearing your cues, especially from young actors who don't project like they did in your youth.\n\nIn a statement to The independenta representative of Kings of Gamblers said: Thank you to our audience and the general public for their well wishes following Ians' fall during this evening's performance of Player Kings.\n\nFollowing a scan, the brilliant NHS team assured us that he would make a speedy and full recovery and Ian is in great spirits.\n\nThe production made the decision to cancel the performance on Tuesday June 18 so that Ian could rest. Those affected will be contacted by their point of purchase as soon as possible tomorrow.\n\nKings of Gamblers is set to move to Bristol Racecourse in July and will also take place in Birmingham, Norwich and Newcastle.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understudy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Understudy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Falstaff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Falstaff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weston_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Weston (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King Lear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry V of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Vic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Old Vic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Kings_Cribbage", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Kings Cribbage", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/19/08/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 3489, "textEnd": 3496}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nA commanding on-screen actor, McKellen has been widely acclaimed for roles including Bill Kraus in And the Band Played On about the AIDS epidemic, which earned him his first Emmy nod in 1994.\n\nHis role as Tsar Nicholas II in Rasputin won him a Golden Globe in 1997 as well as another Emmy nomination.\n\nHe has received five

the Ring, and Richard III, and also a screenplay nomination for Richard III.\n\nHis West End stage credits include No Man's Land, Figures of Speech, King Lear, and Mother Goose.\n\nHe has also starred

A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nSir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, is currently performing in Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Press

A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nSir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, is currently performing in Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@jerseyeveningpost.com",

It was in a scene where Ian McKellen's character, John Falstaff was in a battle.\n\n\"In the scene, he came to the edge of the stage - where I think he was meant to be - and egged on the prince and then just out of nowhere, I just see Ian go, and he'd fallen off of the stage.\n\n\"I had that moment where I thought: 'Is this part of the play?' because his character, Falstaff is brilliant, funny and supposed to be drunk. So it was, it sort of was in keeping with the character, but the moment didn't make any sense, because they're in war. It's not the right moment.\n\n\"So your brain goes for all these things, and it all happened so quickly. As soon as he fell, there was a moment of: 'Oh, my God, what's happened?' everyone had seen it and started murmuring in the audience.\"\n\nShe added: \"Then within about five seconds, we just heard this horrible sound of him, shouting out in what was clearly agony, he was obviously in pain. It was horrible.\n\n\"He was near the edge, which I think is where he was meant to be, so I think he slipped, that's what it looked like from where I was sitting.\"\n\n\"Within what felt like a second, there was a member of stage management on stage. People in the front row where he'd fallen and were quite close to him looked as if they tried to protect him.\n\n\"I don't know if people had got up to see if he was all right, or if everybody was just in shock, but all I could see was the people there were starting to move, and the stage management were telling people to move. Then the lights went up, and we were all told to leave within about probably a minute of it happening. It felt a lot longer in the moment.\"\n\nSally and the rest of the audience were quickly escorted out of the theatre where they were met with staff who revealed an ambulance was on its way.\n\n\"Everybody in the crowd just wanted to know if he was all right. They told us that an ambulance was on its way and that they were he was going to be taken away, and that's all we were told - I think that's all that they knew.\"\n\n\"I have so much respect for the staff there because you could see how upset and shaken they all were, but they handled it very well,\" she added.\n\nIn the show, Ian's character wears a bodysuit which Sally said may have helped cushion his fall. \"He's 85, you know, I've had grandparents that have fallen at that age. One thing I did think was at least he was in a body suit. That very much might have helped his fall.\"\n\nThankfully, it was reported by the BBC that Ian is \"in good spirits\" following his dash to hospital and that he is expected to return to the stage on Wednesday for his matinee performance.\n\nAs for whether the audience members of last night's show will get a chance to see the production again, Sally explained: \"They handed out little slips for everybody regarding the cancellation, and it said on the slip that will be contacted within 72 hours regarding refunds or rearrangements.\n\n\"This was the show's last week in London, and then it's supposed to be travelling around different theatres in the country, Bristol, Norwich.\"\n\n\"I cannot express how brilliant everyone at the theatre was at handling the situation. They were so quick, they were so efficient and I am just so pleased Ian is ok.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabelle_casey@ca.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Isabelle Casey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ian McKellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Falstaff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Falstaff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No\u00ebl_Coward_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "No\u00ebl Coward Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV,_Part_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry IV, Part 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West End theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falstaff_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falstaff (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stage management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bristol"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Tools_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Tools and Equipment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Magic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Magic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets_For_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets For Shows", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/f9CrtcKVrEbDbWkIM8niGA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hello__263/9a0f33513177b52e1842d08927040d9d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659863", "eventUri": "eng-9659863", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

A bit late in the day, but it remains the best thing I ever did.\"\n\nThen in 2015, he said that coming out actually made him a better performer, saying: \"What happened immediately, according to friends, is I became not just a happier person, but a better actor.\"\n\nSir Ian, who now lives in Limehouse, is currently performing in Player Kings, a production of Henry IV, Parts One and Two, at the Noel Coward Theatre in London.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKellen",

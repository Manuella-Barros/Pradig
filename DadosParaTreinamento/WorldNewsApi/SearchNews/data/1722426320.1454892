Multiple late changes for the Warriors, with Mitchell Barnett moving from the second row to start at prop, with Jackson Ford switched to the interchange. Maroons rep Kurt Capewell has been brought off the bench to fill Barnett\u2019s spot in the second row. Dylan Walker will start the game while Tohu Harris will start on the bench. Halfback Shaun Johnson will be out for four weeks with an Achilles injury, so Te Maire Martin will play 7 and Chanel Harris-Tavita takes over at five-eighth. Dallin Watene-Zelezniak returns from suspension to take his place on the wing. For the Broncos there is also a late change, as Tyson Smoothy starts and Billy Walters comes from the bench. None of Reece Walsh, Pat Carrigan or Payne Haas will back up after Origin II, so Tristan Sailor will start at fullback, with Xavier Willison and Kobe Hetherington in the starting pack.", "summary": "After being thumped by the Titans on the Gold Coast last week, the Mount Smart faithful will demand a response from their against the Broncos.

Here's why", "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood's video game performers voted to go on strike Thursday after negotiations with game industry giants that began nearly two years ago came to a halt over artificial intelligence protections.\n\nLeaders of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists have billed the issues behind the labor dispute -- and AI in particular -- as an existential crisis for performers. Game voice actors and motion capture artists' likenesses, they say, could be replicated by AI and used without their consent and without fair compensation.\n\nThe union says the unregulated use of AI poses \"an equal or even greater threat\" to performers in the video game industry than it does in film and television because the capacity to cheaply and easily create convincing digital replicas of performers' voices is widely available.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,\" SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in a statement Wednesday. \"\n\nHere are five things to know about the strike, which starts at 12:01 a.m. Friday:\n\nWho is covered under the contract?\n\nThe agreement covers more than 2,500 \"off-camera voiceover performers, on-camera (motion capture, stunt) performers, stunt coordinators, singers, dancers, puppeteers, and background performers,\" according to SAG-AFTRA.\n\nWhich game companies are involved?\n\nThe union had been negotiating with an industry bargaining group consisting of signatory video game companies, including divisions of Activision and Electronic Arts. Those companies are Activision Productions; Blindlight; Disney Character Voices; Electronic Arts; Productions Inc.; Formosa Interactive; Insomniac Games; Take 2 Productions; VoiceWorks Productions; ad WB Games.\n\nThe game companies have said that they were negotiating in good faith and had reached tentative agreements \"on the vast majority of proposals.\"\n\nNot the first time video game actors have gone on strike\n\nWednesday's labor action marks the second time SAG-AFTRA's video game performers have gone on strike. Their first work stoppage, in October 2016, began after more than one year of negotiations failed. The union and video game companies reached a tentative deal 11 months later, in September 2017. At the time, the strike -- which helped secure a bonus compensation structure for voice actors and performance capture artists -- was the longest in the union's history, following the merger of Hollywood's two largest actors unions in 2012.\n\nWhat are performers asking for?\n\nSAG-AFTRA has said that some of the key issues include securing wages that keep up with inflation, protections around \"exploitative uses\" of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances as well as vocal stress. Union negotiators told The Associated Press that they had made gains in bargaining over wages and job safety, but that the game studios refused to \"provide an equal level of protection from the dangers of AI for all our members.\"\n\nThe signatory companies refused to extend AI protections to on-camera performers, the union said.\n\n\"They're saying we'll protect voiceover performers, but we won't protect anybody else,\" Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA'\n\nAI is the sticking point\n\nAlthough the unchecked use of artificial intelligence has been a sticking point in talks, voice actors and members of the union negotiating committee have said they are not anti-AI. The performers are worried, however, that unchecked use of AI could provide game makers with a means to displace them -- by training an AI to replicate an actor's voice, or to create a digital replica of their likeness without consent.\n\nSome also argue that AI could also strip less experienced actors of the chance to land smaller background roles, such as non-player characters, where they typically cut their teeth before landing larger roles.

The move comes after nearly two years of negotiations with video game giants, including divisions of Activision, Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Co., over a new interactive media deal.\n\nSAG-AFTRA negotiators say gains were made on wages and job security in the video game contract, but studios won't reach an agreement on regulating generative AI. Without safeguards, game companies could train AI to mimic an actor's voice or create a digital replica of their likeness without consent or fair compensation, the union said.\n\nFran Drescher, the union's president, said in a prepared statement that members would not approve a contract that would allow companies to \"abuse AI.\"\n\n\"Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering a deal that our members can live with - and work under - we will be there, ready to negotiate,\" Drescher said.\n\nA representative for the studios did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nAccording to video game market forecaster Newzoo, the global video game industry generates more than $100 billion in revenue annually. The people who design and bring these games to life are the driving force behind that success, SAG-AFTRA said.\n\n\"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair and reasonable protections for AI, but rather in blatant exploitation,\" said Sarah Elmaleh, chair of the Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee.\n\nLast month, union negotiators told The Associated Press that game studios were refusing to \"provide an equal level of protection from the dangers of AI to all of our members\" -- particularly the movement's artists.\n\nLast year, union members voted overwhelmingly to give management the power to strike. Concerns about how movie studios will use artificial intelligence helped fuel the union's four-month-long film and television strikes last year.\n\nThe last interactive contract, which expired in November 2022, did not include protections around AI but did guarantee a bonus pay structure for voice actors and performance capture artists after an 11-month strike that began in October 2016.

Here's why", "body": "More than 2,500 video game voice actors and motion capture performers are going on strike after negotiations with game industry giants that began nearly two years ago failed to result in an agreement\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood's video game performers voted to go on strike Thursday after negotiations with game industry giants that began nearly two years ago came to a halt over artificial intelligence protections.\n\nLeaders of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists have billed the issues behind the labor dispute -- and AI in particular -- as an existential crisis for performers. Game voice actors and motion capture artists' likenesses, they say, could be replicated by AI and used without their consent and without fair compensation.\n\nThe union says the unregulated use of AI poses \"an equal or even greater threat\" to performers in the video game industry than it does in film and television because the capacity to cheaply and easily create convincing digital replicas of performers' voices is widely available.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,\" SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in a statement Wednesday. \"\n\nHere are five things to know about the strike, which starts at 12:01 a.m. Friday:\n\nWho is covered under the contract?\n\nThe agreement covers more than 2,500 \"off-camera voiceover performers, on-camera (motion capture, stunt) performers, stunt coordinators, singers, dancers, puppeteers, and background performers,\" according to SAG-AFTRA.\n\nWhich game companies are involved?\n\nThe union had been negotiating with an industry bargaining group consisting of signatory video game companies, including divisions of Activision and Electronic Arts. Those companies are Activision Productions; Blindlight; Disney Character Voices; Electronic Arts; Productions Inc.; Formosa Interactive; Insomniac Games; Take 2 Productions; VoiceWorks Productions; ad WB Games.\n\nThe game companies have said that they were negotiating in good faith and had reached tentative agreements \"on the vast majority of proposals.\"\n\nNot the first time video game actors have gone on strike\n\nWednesday's labor action marks the second time SAG-AFTRA's video game performers have gone on strike. Their first work stoppage, in October 2016, began after more than one year of negotiations failed. The union and video game companies reached a tentative deal 11 months later, in September 2017. At the time, the strike -- which helped secure a bonus compensation structure for voice actors and performance capture artists -- was the longest in the union's history, following the merger of Hollywood's two largest actors unions in 2012.\n\nWhat are performers asking for?\n\nSAG-AFTRA has said that some of the key issues include securing wages that keep up with inflation, protections around \"exploitative uses\" of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances as well as vocal stress. Union negotiators told The Associated Press that they had made gains in bargaining over wages and job safety, but that the game studios refused to \"provide an equal level of protection from the dangers of AI for all our members.\"\n\nThe signatory companies refused to extend AI protections to on-camera performers, the union said.\n\n\"They're saying we'll protect voiceover performers, but we won't protect anybody else,\" Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's executive director, said in an interview last month. \"The bottom line is if you have performers working for you, helping create the content that's in your game, whether it's voice content, whether it's stunt work, whether it's motion work...all of those performers deserve to have their right to have informed consent and fair compensation for the use of their image, their likeness or voice, their performance. It's that simple.\"\n\nAI is the sticking point\n\nAlthough the unchecked use of artificial intelligence has been a sticking point in talks, voice actors and members of the union negotiating committee have said they are not anti-AI. The performers are worried, however, that unchecked use of AI could provide game makers with a means to displace them -- by training an AI to replicate an actor's voice, or to create a digital replica of their likeness without consent.\n\nSome also argue that AI could also strip less experienced actors of the chance to land smaller background roles, such as non-player characters, where they typically cut their teeth before landing larger roles. The unchecked use of AI, performers say, could also lead to ethical issues if their voices or likenesses are used create content that they do not morally agree with.\n\nSAG-AFTRA created a separate contract in February that covered indie and lower-budget video game projects. The tiered-budget independent interactive media agreement contains some of the protections on AI that video game industry bargaining group rejected.\n\nThe union also announced a side deal with AI voice company Replica Studios in January that enables major studios to work with unionized actors to create and license a digital replica of their voice. It also sets terms that allow performers to opt out of having their voices used in perpetuity.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Existentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Try as they might, the two sides have been unable to see eye to eye on the issue of AI.\n\n\"The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually,\" said SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland in a statement to Aftermath. \"The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the AI use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it's stunning that these video game studios haven't learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to AI, and the public supports us in that.\"\n\nWorkers can now strike at ten companies: Activision, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, EA, Epic, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Take-Two, VoiceWorks, and WB Games.\n\nThe aforementioned companies released their own joint statement:\n\n\"We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations,\" the companies said via a spokesperson. \"We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the [Interactive Media Agreement]. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nSAG-AFTRA membership first voted in favor of authorizing a strike in 2023, which the union's national board followed last week by granting Crabtree-Ireland authority to call a strike if need be. This is the second video game voice actor strike, with the first lasting nearly a year between 2016 and 2017. As a result, actors received a pay raise, though residuals and matters pertaining to vocal stress - other central issues at the time - did not make it into the contract, prompting criticism from some actors.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, SAG-AFTRA again faced controversy when it struck a deal with a company called Replica, with the goal of making it easy for \"professional voice over artists to safely explore new employment opportunities for their digital voice replicas with industry-leading protections tailored to AI technology\" and \"allowing AAA video game studios and other companies working with Replica to access top SAG-AFTRA talent.\" This turned out to be a one-off deal with a single company rather than the broader Interactive Media Agreement over which SAG-AFTRA members had authorized a strike, but performers still felt blindsided by the decision.\n\nNow workers are going to battle to secure their rights across the board.\n\n\"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation, said video game performer and SAG-AFTRA Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee chair Sarah Elmaleh. \"We refuse this paradigm - we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer. We look forward to collaborating with teams on our interim and independent contracts, which provide AI transparency, consent and compensation to all performers, and to continuing to negotiate in good faith with this bargaining group when they are ready to join us in the world we all deserve.\"", "source": {"uri": "aftermath.site", "dataType": "news", "title": "aftermath.site"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The WB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindlight", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blindlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Take-Two Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomniac_Games", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insomniac Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Elmaleh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Elmaleh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AAA (video game industry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_(entertainment_industry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Residual (entertainment industry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfinity", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xfinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/07/sagstrike.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 247, "textEnd": 254}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

You deserve to give or not give your consent, and you need to be paid properly. Period,\" video game actor and SAG-AFTRA Interactive Media Negotiation Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh said Thursday during a briefing about the strike at SAG-AFTRA headquarters in Hollywood.\n\n\"This is fair, this is feasible and anything less is exploitation,\" said Elmaleh, who is known for her roles in games including \"Halo Infinite\" and \"Gone Home.\" \"The employers refuse to plainly affirm in clear and enforceable language that they will protect all performers covered in this contract.\"\n\nSAG-AFTRA said all 160,000 of its members are covered by the strike order. SAG-AFTRA membership includes actors, announcers, broadcast journalists, dancers, voiceover artists and other media professionals, according to its website, including video game performers. The union would not say how many of its members perform in video games, only that their performances fall into three categories: voice, face and body.\n\nThe strike comes just as the four-day Comic-Con comic book convention kicks off in San Diego. SAG-AFTRA said they are carving out a strike exemption for the event.\n\nEvery video game company that is part of the Interactive Media Agreement with SAG-AFTRA will be struck unless they sign on to a new agreement that offers AI protections for the union's members. SAG-AFTRA has been negotiating with Activision Productions, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts Productions, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Llama Production, Take 2 Productions, VoiceWorks Productions and WB Games since October 2022.\n\n\"We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions,\" spokesperson for the video game producers party to the Interactive Media Agreement, Audrey Cooling, told Spectrum News.\n\n\"Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nElmaleh acknowledged that negotiations had brought \"a significant wage increase and safety provisions for our on-camera provisions for our on-camera performers, as well as partial but dangerously incomplete AI provisions.\"\n\nSAG-AFTRA members approved a video game strike with 98.32% approval last September.\n\nU.S. consumer video game spending totaled $57.2 billion in 2023, according to the Entertainment Software Association.\n\nThe video game performers strike comes roughly six months after the Screen Actors Guild ratified a hard-won new contract following a nearly four-month strike that paralyzed much of Hollywood.\n\nMembers of the Writers Guild of America struck the major Hollywood studios May 2 through Sept. 27, overlapping with members of the Screen Actors Guild, who struck July 14 through Nov. 9 to demand higher residual payments from streaming services and protections over the use of artificial intelligence. The new contracts included regulations requiring producers to get actors' consent to use their likenesses for AI and pay them for it.\n\nSAG-AFTRA said the AI protections in the interactive media negotiations \"have so many holes that it puts our existence as perfomers in jeopardy,\" the union's Chief Contracts Officer Ray Rodriguez said during Thursday's briefing. \"There are fewer protections than what was granted from AI through the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild of America strikes last year.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay

The IMA contract expired in November 2022, with negotiations for a new deal between SAG-AFTRA and a convenience bargaining group of gaming publishers (which includes Activision, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Llama Productions, Take 2 Productions, VoiceWorks Productions, and WB Games) beginning prior to that in October 2022. A year later in September 2023, SAG-AFTRA members voted for strike authorization with a 98.32% approval.\n\n\"The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games,\" Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator, said in a statement provided to press today. \"That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the A.I. use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stunning that these video game studios haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learned anything from the lessons of last year\u00e2\u20ac\"that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nAccording to SAG-AFTRA, agreements on many of the demands made by its bargaining committee, including increased pay, extended rest time for physical and vocal performances, as well as required set medics during hazardous recording sessions, have been met during the last year-and-a-half of negotiations. However, according to the union, \"employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their AI language.\" SAG-AFTRA has been seeking, just as it did during last year's Hollywood strikes, further protections around AI technology that included consent for reproduction of a performer's voice or likeness with AI, as well as increased compensation for when AI is used to replicate performances.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough,\" SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher added in a statement. \"When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live\u00e2\u20ac\"and work\u00e2\u20ac\"with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.\"\n\nSAG-AFTRA last struck over stalled negotiations with the IMA in 2016, leading to a 340-day strike largely stemming over attempts to secure residuals for voice actors. The new strike comes, just as last year's SAG-AFTRA strike for film and television actors, at a vital time for the entertainment industry, as the stars and performers of upcoming games like Marvel Rivals,\u00c2 Star Wars Outlaws, and\u00c2 Dragon Age: The Veilguard prepare to promote their work at San Diego Comic-Con this week. However, unlike the far-reaching implications last year's dual SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes impacted upon the 2023 convention, this year due to the close proximity of the event attendees likely won't notice directly. According to an FAQ on SAG-AFTRA's website, \"given the close proximity of the calling of the strike with San Diego Comic-Con, the strike rules relating to promotion and publicity services do not apply to promotion and publicity services provided at SDCC 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_whitbrook@gizmodo.com", "name": "James Whitbrook", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The WB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindlight", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blindlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Take-Two Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomniac_Games", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insomniac Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_(entertainment_industry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Residual (entertainment industry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fran Drescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Writers Guild of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/07/Sag-Aftra-2023-Strike-e1721938812821.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 674, "textEnd": 681}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Here's why", "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood's video game performers voted to go on strike Thursday after negotiations with game industry giants that began nearly two years ago came to a halt over artificial intelligence protections.\n\nLeaders of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists have billed the issues behind the labor dispute -- and AI in particular -- as an existential crisis for performers. Game voice actors and motion capture artists' likenesses, they say, could be replicated by AI and used without their consent and without fair compensation.\n\nThe union says the unregulated use of AI poses \"an equal or even greater threat\" to performers in the video game industry than it does in film and television because the capacity to cheaply and easily create convincing digital replicas of performers' voices is widely available.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,\" SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in a statement Wednesday. \"\n\nHere are five things to know about the strike, which starts at 12:01 a.m. Friday:\n\nThe agreement covers more than 2,500 \"off-camera voiceover performers, on-camera (motion capture, stunt) performers, stunt coordinators, singers, dancers, puppeteers, and background performers,\" according to SAG-AFTRA.\n\nThe union had been negotiating with an industry bargaining group consisting of signatory video game companies, including divisions of Activision and Electronic Arts. Those companies are Activision Productions; Blindlight; Disney Character Voices; Electronic Arts; Productions Inc.; Formosa Interactive; Insomniac Games; Take 2 Productions; VoiceWorks Productions; ad WB Games.\n\nThe game companies have said that they were negotiating in good faith and had reached tentative agreements \"on the vast majority of proposals.\"\n\nWednesday's labor action marks the second time SAG-AFTRA's video game performers have gone on strike. Their first work stoppage, in October 2016, began after more than one year of negotiations failed. The union and video game companies reached a tentative deal 11 months later, in September 2017. At the time, the strike -- which helped secure a bonus compensation structure for voice actors and performance capture artists -- was the longest in the union's history, following the merger of Hollywood's two largest actors unions in 2012.\n\nSAG-AFTRA has said that some of the key issues include securing wages that keep up with inflation, protections around \"exploitative uses\" of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances as well as vocal stress. Union negotiators told The Associated Press that they had made gains in bargaining over wages and job safety, but that the game studios refused to \"provide an equal level of protection from the dangers of AI for all our members.\"\n\nThe signatory companies refused to extend AI protections to on-camera performers, the union said.\n\n\"They're saying we'll protect voiceover performers, but we won't protect anybody else,\" Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's executive director, said in an interview last month. \"The bottom line is if you have performers working for you, helping create the content that's in your game, whether it's voice content, whether it's stunt work, whether it's motion work...all of those performers deserve to have their right to have informed consent and fair compensation for the use of their image, their likeness or voice, their performance. It's that simple.\"\n\nAlthough the unchecked use of artificial intelligence has been a sticking point in talks, voice actors and members of the union negotiating committee have said they are not anti-AI. The performers are worried, however, that unchecked use of AI could provide game makers with a means to displace them -- by training an AI to replicate an actor's voice, or to create a digital replica of their likeness without consent.\n\nSome also argue that AI could also strip less experienced actors of the chance to land smaller background roles, such as non-player characters, where they typically cut their teeth before landing larger roles. The unchecked use of AI, performers say, could also lead to ethical issues if their voices or likenesses are used create content that they do not morally agree with.\n\nSAG-AFTRA created a separate contract in February that covered indie and lower-budget video game projects. The tiered-budget independent interactive media agreement contains some of the protections on AI that video game industry bargaining group rejected.\n\nThe union also announced a side deal with AI voice company Replica Studios in January that enables major studios to work with unionized actors to create and license a digital replica of their voice. It also sets terms that allow performers to opt out of having their voices used in perpetuity.", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@orlandosentinel.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fran Drescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Existentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

While the actors and writers unions came to deals with studios in the fall, negotiations between video game actors and major game developers have gone on more than a year and a half, according to their union, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, or SAG-AFTRA.\n\nThe union represents 160,000 actors and is negotiating with a group that represents video game companies including: Activision Productions, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts, Productions Inc., Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Take 2 Productions, VoiceWorks Productions and WB Games.\n\n\"Although agreements have been reached on many issues important to SAG-AFTRA members, the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their A.I. language,\" SAG-AFTRA said in a news release.\n\nIn an email statement to NBC News, a spokesperson for the video game producers said they are \"disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations.\"\n\n\"We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nIt is the second time voice actors and performance capture artists will have gone on strike. The group went on an 11-month strike starting in October 2016. The actors' last interactive contract, which expired in November 2022, did not provide protections around AI.\n\n\"Frankly, it's stunning that these video game studios haven't learned anything from the lessons of last year -- that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that,\" SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a statement.\n\nActors in the video game sphere often don't just lend their voices to characters but do full performances in motion capture. Some even lend their likenesses to characters replicated in the digital space.\n\nIn September, video game voice actors and motion capture performers overwhelming voted to authorize a strike if negotiations on a new labor contract failed.\n\nIn January, SAG-AFTRA announced a deal with Replica Studios, an AI voice technology company, to establish protections around the licensing of digitally replicated voices. But some people on social media appeared wary of the news, responding to SAG-AFTRA's Instagram post with a mix of confusion and frustration.\n\nOn social media, AI voice replication has grown into its own cottage genre of content. Some actors, like Roger Clark, who plays the lead gun-slinging cowboy Arthur Morgan in \"Red Dead Redemption 2,\" have been vocal about pushing back on fans using AI technology to replicate their voices in memes and other kinds of content.\n\nUnion leaders previously told The Associated Press that they aren't \"anti-AI altogether.\" But many have remained concerned over the unchecked use of AI, citing fears that game makers will be able to displace actors by training AIs to replicate their voices or creating digital replicas of their likenesses without consent.\n\nIn a Zoom meeting after the strike was announced, Ray Rodriguez, chief contracts officer for SAG-AFTRA, described the strike as a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"In this negotiation we have not received everything we received in the replica deal, and if we had, we would not be announcing a strike,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nZeke Alton, a video game performer and a member of the negotiating team, said that \"progress has been made\" on digital replicas, which is when a performer gives a performance and then the studio uses that input to create a scene the performer wasn't there to give.\n\nBut the Interactive Media Agreement in its current form is dangerously incomplete and leaves loopholes for performers to be exploited, Alton said.\n\n\"We're left with practically no protection for our future,\" he said. \"It's gross.\"\n\nUnion leaders said San Diego ComicCon, which began Thursday, would be exempt from the strike.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Here's Why", "body": "LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hollywood's video game performers voted to go on strike Thursday after negotiations with game industry giants that began nearly two years ago came to a halt over artificial intelligence protections.\n\nLeaders of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists have billed the issues behind the labor dispute -- and AI in particular -- as an existential crisis for performers. Game voice actors and motion capture artists' likenesses, they say, could be replicated by AI and used without their consent and without fair compensation.\n\nThe union says the unregulated use of AI poses \"an equal or even greater threat\" to performers in the video game industry than it does in film and television because the capacity to cheaply and easily create convincing digital replicas of performers' voices is widely available.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,\" SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in a statement Wednesday. \"\n\nHere are five things to know about the strike, which starts at 12:01 a.m. Friday:\n\nWho is covered under the contract?\n\nThe agreement covers more than 2,500 \"off-camera voiceover performers, on-camera (motion capture, stunt) performers, stunt coordinators, singers, dancers, puppeteers, and background performers,\" according to SAG-AFTRA.\n\nWhich game companies are involved?\n\nThe union had been negotiating with an industry bargaining group consisting of signatory video game companies, including divisions of Activision and Electronic Arts. Those companies are Activision Productions; Blindlight; Disney Character Voices; Electronic Arts; Productions Inc.; Formosa Interactive; Insomniac Games; Take 2 Productions; VoiceWorks Productions; ad WB Games.\n\nThe game companies have said that they were negotiating in good faith and had reached tentative agreements \"on the vast majority of proposals.\"\n\nNot the first time video game actors have gone on strike\n\nWednesday's labor action marks the second time SAG-AFTRA's video game performers have gone on strike. Their first work stoppage, in October 2016, began after more than one year of negotiations failed. The union and video game companies reached a tentative deal 11 months later, in September 2017. At the time, the strike -- which helped secure a bonus compensation structure for voice actors and performance capture artists -- was the longest in the union's history, following the merger of Hollywood's two largest actors unions in 2012.\n\nWhat are performers asking for?\n\nSAG-AFTRA has said that some of the key issues include securing wages that keep up with inflation, protections around \"exploitative uses\" of artificial intelligence and safety precautions that account for the strain of physical performances as well as vocal stress. Union negotiators told The Associated Press that they had made gains in bargaining over wages and job safety, but that the game studios refused to \"provide an equal level of protection from the dangers of AI for all our members.\"\n\nThe signatory companies refused to extend AI protections to on-camera performers, the union said.\n\n\"They're saying we'll protect voiceover performers, but we won't protect anybody else,\" Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's executive director, said in an interview last month. \"The bottom line is if you have performers working for you, helping create the content that's in your game, whether it's voice content, whether it's stunt work, whether it's motion work...all of those performers deserve to have their right to have informed consent and fair compensation for the use of their image, their likeness or voice, their performance. It's that simple.\"\n\nAI is the sticking point\n\nAlthough the unchecked use of artificial intelligence has been a sticking point in talks, voice actors and members of the union negotiating committee have said they are not anti-AI.

While the actors and writers unions came to a deal with studios in the fall, negotiations between video game actors and major game developers have gone on more than a year and a half, according to SAG-AFTRA.\n\nSAG-AFTRA, which represents 160,000 actors, is negotiating with a group that represents video game companies including: Activision Productions; Blindlight; Disney Character Voices; Electronic Arts; Productions Inc.; Formosa Interactive; Insomniac Games; Take 2 Productions; VoiceWorks Productions; ad WB Games.\n\n\"Although agreements have been reached on many issues important to SAG-AFTRA members, the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their A.I. language,\" SAG-AFTRA said in its news release.\n\nIn a statement to Variety, a spokesperson for the video game producers said they are \"disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations.\"\n\n\"We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nThey did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.\n\nThis marks the second time voice actors and performance capture artists will strike. The group previously went on an 11-month strike in October 2016. The actors' last interactive contract expired in November 2022, and did not provide protections around AI.\n\n\"Frankly, it's stunning that these video game studios haven't learned anything from the lessons of last year -- that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that,\" SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a statement in a news release.\n\nActors in the video game sphere often don't just lend their voices to characters, but full performances in motion capture. Some even lend their likeness to characters replicated in the digital space.\n\nIn September, video game voice actors and motion capture performers overwhelming voted to authorize a strike if negotiations on a new labor contract fail.\n\nIn January, SAG-AFTRA announced a deal with Replica Studios, an AI voice technology company, to establish protections around the licensing of digitally replicated voices. But some people on social media appeared wary of the news, responding to SAG-AFTRA's Instagram post with a mix of confusion and frustration.\n\nUnion leaders previously told the Associated Press that they aren't \"anti-AI altogether.\" But many have remained concerned over the unchecked use of AI, citing fears that game makers will be able to displace actors by training an AI to replicate their voices or creating digital replicas of their likeness without consent.\n\nOn social media, AI voice replication has grown into its own cottage genre of content. Some actors, like Roger Clark, who plays the lead gun-slinging cowboy Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 2, have been vocal about pushing back on fans using AI technology to replicate their voices in memes and other kinds of content.\n\n\"I don't get a kick out of it at all,\" Clark said in a TikTok posted earlier this year. \"It's plagiarism software ... if you keep sharing this rubbish sooner or later than you think, it'll be all you have left.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

SAG-AFTRA has been attempting to re-negotiate its Interactive Media Agreement with the ten aforementioned companies since October 2022; however, there is still no deal in place at this time.\n\n\"Although agreements have been reached on many issues important to SAG-AFTRA members, the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their A.I. language,\" SAG-AFTRA said in a statement, which can be read by clicking here.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,\" stated SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher.\n\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator and national executive director for SAG-AFTRA added, \"The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the A.I. use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it's stunning that these video game studios haven't learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that.\"", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_schreur@comingsoon.net", "name": "Brandon Schreur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_film_studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major film studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindlight", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blindlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Take-Two Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomniac_Games", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insomniac Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The move comes after nearly two years of negotiations with gaming giants, including divisions of Activision, Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Co., over a new interactive media agreement.\n\nSAG-AFTRA negotiators say gains have been made over wages and job safety in the video game contract, but that the two sides remained split over the regulation of generative AI. A spokesperson for the video game producers, Audrey Cooling, said the studios offered AI protections, but SAG-AFTRA's negotiating committee said that the studios' definition of who constitutes a \"performer\" is key to understanding the issue of who would be protected.\n\n\"The industry has told us point blank that they do not necessarily consider everyone who is rendering movement performance to be a performer that is covered by the collective bargaining agreement,\" SAG-AFTRA Chief Contracts Officer Ray Rodriguez said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. He said some physical performances are being treated as \"data.\"\n\nWithout guardrails, game companies could train AI to replicate an actor's voice, or create a digital replica of their likeness without consent or fair compensation, the union said.\n\n\"We strike as a matter of last resort. We have given this process absolutely as much time as we responsibly can,\" Rodriguez told reporters. \"We have exhausted the other possibilities, and that is why we're doing it now.\"\n\nCooling said the companies' offer \"extends meaningful AI protections.\"\n\n\"We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations,\" she said.\n\nAndi Norris, an actor and member of the union's negotiating committee, said that those who do stunt work or creature performances would still be at risk under the game companies' offer.\n\n\"The performers who bring their body of work to these games create a whole variety of characters, and all of that work must be covered. Their proposal would carve out anything that doesn't look and sound identical to me as I sit here, when, in truth, on any given week I am a zombie, I am a soldier, I am a zombie soldier,\" Norris said. \"We cannot and will not accept that a stunt or movement performer giving a full performance on stage next to a voice actor isn't a performer.\"\n\nThe global video game industry generates well over $100 billion dollars in profit annually, according to game market forecaster Newzoo. The people who design and bring those games to life are the driving force behind that success, SAG-AFTRA said.\n\nMembers voted overwhelmingly last year to give leadership the authority to strike. Concerns about how movie studios will use AI helped fuel last year's film and television strikes by the union, which lasted four months.\n\nThe last interactive contract, which expired in November 2022, did not provide protections around AI but secured a bonus compensation structure for voice actors and performance capture artists after an 11-month strike that began in October 2016. That work stoppage marked the first major labor action from SAG-AFTRA following the merger of Hollywood's two largest actors unions in 2012.\n\nThe video game agreement covers more than 2,500 \"off-camera (voiceover) performers, on-camera (motion capture, stunt) performers, stunt coordinators, singers, dancers, puppeteers, and background performers,\" according to the union.\n\nAmid the tense interactive negotiations, SAG-AFTRA created a separate contract in February that covered independent and lower-budget video game projects. The tiered-budget independent interactive media agreement contains some of the protections on AI that video game industry titans have rejected. Games signed to an interim interactive media agreement, tiered-budget independent interactive agreement or interim interactive localization agreement are not part of the strike, the union said.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interactive media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zombie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collective bargaining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://assets.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/sun-app-large.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-", "textStart": 3525, "textEnd": 3537}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The strike will go into effect at 12:01 AM PT on July 26.\n\n\"Any game looking to employ SAG-AFTRA talent to perform covered work must sign on to the new Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement, the Interim Interactive Media Agreement, or the Interim Interactive Localization Agreement,\" reads the press release announcing the strike. \"These agreements offer critical AI protections for members.\"\n\nSAG-AFTRA has been struggling to come to an agreement on AI usage in game development for months--specifically the use of AI in place of human voice actors and motion-capture performers. In January, SAG-AFTRA signed a controversial agreement with AI voice software company Replica Studios. The agreement, which essentially approved AI voice acting in video games, was criticized by voice actors, many of whom claimed they were never consulted about the agreement.\n\nThe convenience bargaining group SAG-AFTRA is currently negotiating with includes the following gaming studios:\n\nIt's not immediately clear which games will be affected by the strike, but delays would be more likely to happen for games that are still in early in development, rather than anything close to launch. There's no telling how long the strike itself will last.\n\nEA has already voiced support for the use of AI in its games, Ubisoft is experimenting with AI NPCs that can have \"real conversations,\" and the devs behind The Finals have also defended its use of AI voice-acting. Other entities in the gaming industry have taken a stand against AI, with Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney stating, \"Game companies shouldn't receive generative AI voice training rights on dialog recording sessions,\" and Valve requiring developers to disclose the use of AI in any games they list on Steam.\n\n\"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation,\" Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh said of the strike. \"We refuse this paradigm--we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer. We look forward to collaborating with teams on our Interim and Independent contracts, which provide AI transparency, consent and compensation to all performers, and to continuing to negotiate in good faith with this bargaining group when they are ready to join us in the world we all deserve.\"\n\nSAG-AFTRA members working in film and television previously went on strike in 2023, with the use of AI being one of the biggest issues in the negotiations.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members,\" added SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher. \"Enough is enough.

The strike takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday.\n\nThe announcement came days after SAG-AFTRA's national board granted Crabtree-Ireland the authority to initiate a walkout and nearly a year after union members voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike.\n\nOn Saturday, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists warned that a work stoppage was imminent if the union and the video game producers could not iron out contract terms related to artificial intelligence.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members.

When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,\" said SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher in a statement.\n\nThe Interactive Media Agreement -- a contract covering roughly 2,600 performers doing voice-over and motion-capture work in the video game industry -- expired in November 2022.\n\n\"We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations,\" Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game producers, said in a statement.\n\n\"We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nGame actors are seeking a new deal that would require producers to obtain their consent before reproducing their voices or likenesses with AI. They have also demanded compensation when AI is used to replicate their performances, as well as wage increases, more rest time and set medics for hazardous jobs.\n\nPerformers in the video game industry argue that they are especially vulnerable to AI due to the invisible nature of voice-over work.\n\n\"Our resolve is unwavering and should not be tested,\" Crabtree-Ireland said in a statement released Saturday.\n\n\"We are steadfast in our commitment to our membership who work this contract and whose extraordinary performances are the heart and soul of the world's most popular video games.

That walkout lasted 118 days and culminated in an agreement containing wage increases, AI protections and streaming bonuses, among other gains.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fran Drescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_(entertainment_industry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Residual (entertainment industry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative_Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video/Alternative Video", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/History", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/History", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/299/29935/2993533.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-", "textStart": 2995, "textEnd": 3007}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

SAG-AFTRA is now striking against video game companies.\n\nLast year, Hollywood came to a grinding halt when the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) went on strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) for better wages, stronger benefits, and proper compensation (including residuals) for streaming content.\n\nBut this massive, six-month strike also targeted something more sinister. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA had deep concerns about AI straight-up stealing their jobs. Studios allegedly wanted to pay background actors a flat, one-time fee to scan their bodies, then use and reproduce their likeness forever -- possibly even in death.\n\nNow, they're standing up against AI abuse in the video game industry.\n\nOn Thursday, SAG-AFTRA-protected video game performers authorized another strike -- with a 98.32 percent \"yes\" vote -- this time against gaming giants including Warner Bros., Activision, and others after nearly two years of negotiations for a new interactive media agreement. Essentially, video game performers want game developers and publishers to regulate AI usage so performers' voices, likenesses, and movements cannot be digitally replicated without their consent or without proper compensation.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,\" said SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher.\n\n\"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation,\" said Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh. \"We refuse this paradigm-we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer. We look forward to collaborating with teams on our Interim and Independent contracts, which provide AI transparency, consent and compensation to all performers, and to continuing to negotiate in good faith with this bargaining group when they are ready to join us in the world we all deserve.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the last interactive media contract expired in November 2022. It didn't provide protections against AI, but following an 11-month strike by voice actors and video game performers, it did secure a bonus compensation structure. The new strike, which starts Friday, marks the second time video game voice actors and motion capture performers have authorized a strike since SAG-AFTRA joined forces in 2012. More than 2,500 union members are covered under the video game agreement, according to the union.\n\nIn its statement, SAG-AFTRA said, \"Any game looking to employ SAG-AFTRA talent to perform covered work must sign on to the new Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement, the Interim Interactive Media Agreement or the Interim Interactive Localization Agreement. These agreements offer critical AI protections for members.\"\n\nWhat they're asking for shouldn't be controversial, but we've already seen examples of companies using AI to mimic real people's voices. Earlier this year, Sam Altman's OpenAI -- the tech company behind ChatGPT -- made headlines for allegedly using Scarlett Johansson's voice as the basis for its updated ChatGPT client, \"Sky.\" Unfortunately for Altman, Johansson immediately released a statement claiming she had rejected OpenAI's offer to hire her to voice Sky, but the company did it anyway.\n\n\"When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered, and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference,\" Johansson said. \"Mr. Altman even insinuated that the similarity was intentional, tweeting a single word, 'her' -- a reference to the film in which I voiced a chat system, Samantha, who forms an intimate relationship with a human.\"\n\nAltman refuted the claims but halted use of the Sky voice in OpenAI products. This is just one example of how AI has begun to run rampant over people's lives, from plagiarizing authors to stealing art for generative content. Realistically, we are all fighting against AI, especially in the US where there is no federal legislation or regulation in place to combat AI theft.\n\nThis strike will impact the future of video games and video game performers. We stand in solidarity with SAG-AFTRA in its fight for job protections and strict condemnation of unethical use of AI technology.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samantha_puc@themarysue.com", "name": "Samantha Puc", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Producers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Writers Guild of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Picketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_(entertainment_industry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Residual (entertainment industry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Television_and_Radio_Artists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Federation of Television and Radio Artists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interactive media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screen Actors Guild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(acting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra (acting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fran Drescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action-Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action-Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/video-game-strike.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The strike, which begins at 12:01 a.m. on Friday, July 26, 2024, follows a protracted negotiation process with major game studios over a new contract. The heart of the dispute lies in the lack of safeguards against the misuse of artificial intelligence, a pressing issue that has sparked concern among voice actors and motion capture artists.\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has been negotiating for nearly two years with prominent gaming companies like Activision, Warner Bros., and Walt Disney Co. While progress was made on wages and job safety, the studios' refusal to include robust protections against AI has led to this unprecedented strike.

After attempting to meet on agreement with several high-profile companies on a new Interactive Media Agreement, the union has voted and approved a strike to kick off on July 26 at 12:01 am.

Time is running out for the companies to reach an agreement.\n\nCooling responded that the companies were negotiating in good faith and stressed that the two sides had reached tentative agreements on the vast majority of the proposals.\n\n\"Based on this progress, we remain optimistic that an agreement can be reached,\" she said.\n\nThe last strike by video game players was in October 2016, before AI became a major concern.\n\nAt the time, actors sought to collect residual payments based on the number of physical and digital copies of games sold, similar to how film and television actors are paid for their work.\n\nResidue and AI emerged as sticking points during last year's Hollywood actors' strike, which lasted 118 days and resulted in a deal that included pay raises, AI protections and streaming bonuses, among other gains.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fran Drescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_(entertainment_industry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Residual (entertainment industry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i.imgur.com/AoyxWyw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-", "textStart": 2991, "textEnd": 3003}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The strike is effective beginning July 26 at 12:01 a.m., and several companies will be impacted, including Insomniac and Take 2. It is the second video game strike, as SAG-AFTRA previously went on strike in 2016 over protection and hiring transparency.\n\nSAG-AFTRA is going on strike once again. This time, the labor union is doing so over protection against Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) for video game voice actors. The strike is effective July 26 at 12:01 a.m. and comes after over a year and a half of failed negotiations without a deal.\n\nPer SAG-AFTRA's announcement, ten video game companies will be affected by the authorization of a strike. They are: Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Llama Productions LLC, Take 2 Productions Inc., VoiceWorks Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc.\n\nAs a result of the decision to strike, in order to bring in a SAG-AFTRA talent to voice a game, the company must sign one of three agreements. The new Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement, the Interim Interactive Media Agreement or the Interactive Localization Agreement. Each of these agreements carries protection against A.I., a critical sticking point for SAG-AFTRA.\n\nIn a statement following the decision to strike, SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said the following: \"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.\"\n\nSAG-AFTRA Negotiations Date Back To October 2022\n\nThe fight against A.I. has been ongoing since October 2022, and a year after those negotiations began, SAG-AFTRA voted for a strike authorization on September 24, 2023. While there is a lot to unpack regarding the strike, put simply, SAG-AFTRA is looking for protection against generative A.I. for its members.\n\nIn an FAQ included on its website, SAG-AFTRA wrote the following when it comes to video games:\n\nAdditionally, your favorite performances are brought to life through the artistry of human actors who improvise, tap into personal experiences, and collaborate with writers and directors to create a performance that only they could provide. No two actors are the same, and every performance is unique.\n\nGenerative A.I. tools threaten to replace these artists with derivative, machine-recycled performance, lacking perspective or surprise. A.I.-generated performances will not carry the originality, pathos or humor of an actual human actor.\n\nFor what it's worth, this would not be the first time that video game artists have gone on strike. A 2016 strike lasted several months, and was held over secondary compensation, increased hiring transparency and on-set safety precautions, according to an NPR news report. An agreement was reached after months of negotiations.\n\n\"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable A.I. protections, but rather flagrant exploitation,\" Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh said in part. \"We refuse this paradigm - we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen just how long this strike will last, though it's clear that it won't end until protections against generative A.I. are guaranteed.", "source": {"uri": "thegamer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheGamer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Take-Two Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomniac_Games", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insomniac Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindlight", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blindlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

This vote comes after over a year and a half of negotiations between game companies and workers that has not yet resulted in a deal.\n\nThe main reason for the strike, SAG-AFTRA says, is that video game companies have not come to an agreement with actors over regulating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in their projects.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members.

We refuse this paradigm - we will not leave any of our members behind or wait for sufficient protection any longer.\"\n\nNotably, the strike rules do not impact promotion at San Diego Comic Con this weekend, which SAG-AFTRA says is due to the \"close proximity of the calling of the strike\" to the event.\n\nNews that a strike focused on video game voice actors has been brewing for a long time. Last September, while striking against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, SAG-AFTRA sought to authorize a second strike against video game companies. News that a strike was imminent once again surfaced in March during SXSW when SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said the odds of a strike against video game companies was \"50-50 or more likely.\"\n\n\"We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions,\" Interactive Media Agreement spokesperson Audrey Cooling said in a statement provided to IGN. \"Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nOver the last year, using GenAI in video games has become a hot-button and polarizing topic in the gaming industry. Critics argue the use of AI is stripping away the jobs of game developers. A few notable examples of gaming companies using GenAI in its projects include Ubisoft introducing a ghostwriting tool to help its game writers develop better dialogue for NPCs and save time writing said lines. Square Enix confirmed in January that its PlayStation-exclusive Fomastars features AI-generated art. Additionally, Wired reported this week that Activision allegedly made and sold AI-generated cosmetics in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Producers", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fran Drescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_by_Southwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South by Southwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IGN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Enix", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Square Enix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ubisoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/sag-aftra-1721936740436.png?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 210, "textEnd": 217}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The move comes after nearly two years of negotiations with gaming giants, including divisions of Activision, Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Co., over a new interactive media agreement.\n\nSAG-AFTRA negotiators say gains have been made over wages and job safety in the video game contract, but that the two sides remained split over the regulation of generative AI. A spokesperson for the video game producers, Audrey Cooling, said the studios offered AI protections, but SAG-AFTRA's negotiating committee said that the studios' definition of who constitutes a \"performer\" is key to understanding the issue of who would be protected.\n\n\"The industry has told us point blank that they do not necessarily consider everyone who is rendering movement performance to be a performer that is covered by the collective bargaining agreement,\" SAG-AFTRA Chief Contracts Officer Ray Rodriguez said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. He said some physical performances are being treated as \"data.\"\n\nWithout guardrails, game companies could train AI to replicate an actor's voice, or create a digital replica of their likeness without consent or fair compensation, the union said.\n\n\"We strike as a matter of last resort. We have given this process absolutely as much time as we responsibly can,\" Rodriguez told reporters. \"We have exhausted the other possibilities, and that is why we're doing it now.\"\n\nCooling said the companies' offer \"extends meaningful AI protections.\"\n\n\"We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations,\" she said.\n\nToday's Top Headlines A new shopping experience: Lowes Foods opens on Aiken's Southside Dismantling work at former Savannah River Site MOX facility completed ahead of schedule First responders called to two-vehicle accident on Aiken's bypass Aiken's horse: Fedarman B carries on Annie Goodwin's Olympic dream Northside apartment complex sells for more than $3 million Aiken woman charged with murder after man's body found Monday morning Beech Island man accused of sexually assaulting a minor, posing as 14-year-old Snoop Dogg aims to inspire global audience at Paris Olympics as torch bearer before opening ceremony Aiken High head football coach Dwayne Garrick retiring from coaching Medical office building in Aiken sells for more than $4 million\n\nAndi Norris, an actor and member of the union's negotiating committee, said that those who do stunt work or creature performances would still be at risk under the game companies' offer.\n\n\"The performers who bring their body of work to these games create a whole variety of characters, and all of that work must be covered. Their proposal would carve out anything that doesn't look and sound identical to me as I sit here, when, in truth, on any given week I am a zombie, I am a soldier, I am a zombie soldier,\" Norris said. \"We cannot and will not accept that a stunt or movement performer giving a full performance on stage next to a voice actor isn't a performer.\"\n\nThe global video game industry generates well over $100 billion dollars in profit annually, according to game market forecaster Newzoo. The people who design and bring those games to life are the driving force behind that success, SAG-AFTRA said.\n\nMembers voted overwhelmingly last year to give leadership the authority to strike. Concerns about how movie studios will use AI helped fuel last year's film and television strikes by the union, which lasted four months.\n\nThe last interactive contract, which expired in November 2022, did not provide protections around AI but secured a bonus compensation structure for voice actors and performance capture artists after an 11-month strike that began in October 2016. That work stoppage marked the first major labor action from SAG-AFTRA following the merger of Hollywood's two largest actors unions in 2012.\n\nThe video game agreement covers more than 2,500 \"off-camera (voiceover) performers, on-camera (motion capture, stunt) performers, stunt coordinators, singers, dancers, puppeteers, and background performers,\" according to the union.\n\nAmid the tense interactive negotiations, SAG-AFTRA created a separate contract in February that covered independent and lower-budget video game projects. The tiered-budget independent interactive media agreement contains some of the protections on AI that video game industry titans have rejected. Games signed to an interim interactive media agreement, tiered-budget independent interactive agreement or interim interactive localization agreement are not part of the strike, the union said.",

Games.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough,\" SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher, star of 1990s sitcom \"The Nanny,\" said in a statement.\n\n\"When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.\"\n\nThe agreement under discussion concerns some 2,600 artists who provide voice dubbing services for video games, or whose physical movements are recorded in order to animate computer-generated characters.\n\nUnion members are concerned about the industry's use of AI, as the technology makes it possible to reproduce an actor's voice or digitally recreate a stuntman's actions without their consent or fair remuneration.\n\nWith American actors winning their case against movie studios and television producers after a historic strike largely paralyzed Hollywood last year, SAG-AFTRA is similarly demanding guarantees from the video game industry.\n\n\"Frankly, it's stunning that these video game studios haven't learned anything from the lessons of last year -- that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that,\" said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union's chief negotiator.\n\nFacing stalled negotiations, the video game actors had authorized their union to call a strike last September. The collective agreement governing their working conditions expired in November 2022.\n\nThe video game producers had cited progress in the talks.\n\n\"We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations,\" Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the producers, said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Cooling, the management's offer includes \"historic wage increases\" and \"meaningful AI protections,\" including requiring \"consent and fair compensation\" for artists.\n\nrfo/mlm/mdl", "source": {"uri": "wfxg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFXG FOX54"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@wfxg.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The strike, tied to the Interactive Media Agreement, goes into effect Friday at midnight.\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists wrote in a press release that the union was unable to reach an agreement with video game companies around AI protections, stating, \"the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their A.I. language.\"\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members,\" SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher wrote in a statement. \"Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.\"\n\nCrabtree-Ireland added that video game performers are the \"driving force\" behind successful video game companies and that \"they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the A.I. use of their faces, voices, and bodies.\"\n\n\"Frankly, it's stunning that these video game studios haven't learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that,\" he wrote.\n\nOn July 20, the SAG-AFTRA (the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) national board granted Crabtree-Ireland the authority to call for a strike against video game companies if a deal is not reached. As of Saturday, the parties remained \"far apart\" on their proposals around A.I. projections, according to a press release. Despite this, Crabtree-Ireland wrote in the Saturday release that the union's resolve is \"unwavering\" and \"should not be tested.\"\n\n\"We are steadfast in our commitment to our membership who work this contract and whose extraordinary performances are the heart and soul of the world's most popular video games,\" Crabtree-Ireland said in a press statement. \"Time is running out for the companies to make a deal.\"\n\nThe video game companies impacted by the work stoppage include Insomniac Games Inc., WB Games Inc., Epic Games Inc., Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Take 2 Productions Inc., VoiceWorks Productions Inc., and Disney Character Voices Inc.\n\nIn September, more than 30,000 SAG-AFTRA members voted 98. 32 percent in favor of a strike authorization against the 10 video game companies. Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee chair Sarah Elmaleh wrote in a statement that she looks forward to reaching an agreement around A.I. transparency, consent, and compensation for all performers.\n\n\"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable A.I. protections, but rather flagrant exploitation. We refuse this paradigm - we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer,\" Elmaleh wrote.\n\nThe Interactive Media Agreement, which protects about 2,600 voice and motion capture performers in the video game industry, expired in November 2022. In the latest contract negotiations, video game performers are seeking consent for the creation of AI replicas, or the use of their voice and likeness using AI, and compensation for use.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kalia_richardson@rollingstone.com", "name": "Kalia Richardson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fran Drescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dinklage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Dinklage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliette_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juliette Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The strike will begin on Friday, July 26, SAG-AFTRA said in a statement.\n\nThe actor's union has been in negotiations with video game studios Since October 2022.\n\n\"The most important point is that we're talking about emerging technology that is going to affect the entire world,\" SAG-AFTRA spokesperson Zeke Alton told Decrypt during a media Q&A. \"We just happen to be the canary in the coal mine. We're setting a precedent for how the workforce in general, both the United States and around the world, is going to be treated.\"\n\nWhile the 2023 actors' strike concerned other important issues, including pay and residuals, generative AI was a key striking point. Alton said this concern continues in the current video game industry negotiations.\n\n\"Are they going to use this new emergent technology as tools for creatives and for workers to create efficiency? Or is this tool going to be used by executives to remove the worker?\" the spokesperson asked. \"That's why this fight -- the fight that came before and this one that follows on -- has to build upon it.\n\n\"Because it's really, really important that we as workers in the labor environment in general understand that we have rights, and that we're not here to just be wiped out,\" Alton added.\n\nSAG-AFTRA declined to comment on how and where strike actions will take place.\n\n\"Although agreements have been reached on many issues important to SAG-AFTRA members, the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their AI language,\" SAG-AFTRA said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the terms of the strike, SAG-AFTRA members will cease performing, providing technical support, motion capture work, and engaging in physical and online publicity.\n\n\"Given the close proximity of the calling of the strike with San Diego Comic-Con, the foregoing rules relating to promotion and publicity services do not apply to promotion and publicity services provided at SDCC,\" SAG-AFTRA added.\n\nThe video game studios with which SAG-AFTRA has been negotiating include Activision Productions, Electronic Arts Productions, Disney Character Voices, WB Games, Insomniac Games, Formosa Interactive, Llama Productions, Take 2 Productions, VoiceWorks Productions, and Blindlight.\n\nWorkers across industries have worried about losing their jobs to generative AI after the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Among the most outspoken are those in the film, television, and video game industry.\n\n\"There's a ton of anxiety for artists across the board with AI,\" Molly Warner, an environment artist at Blizzard Entertainment, told Wired Magazine last week. \"Pretty much everyone I know is vehemently against the use of AI-generated images.\"\n\nThe video game strike comes less than a year after the actors' union ended its last strike after negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) stalled in July 2023.\n\n\"Frankly, it's stunning that these video game studios haven't learned anything from the lessons of last year -- that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that,\" SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director & Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a press release.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AA to the detriment of our members.

The decision to hit the picket lines comes 10 months after the union's initial strike authorization vote. The strike goes into effect July 26 at 12:01 a.m.\n\nThe 10 companies facing the strike are Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Epic Games, Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Take 2 Productions Inc., VoiceWorks Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,\" SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said in a statement.\n\nLast week, the SAG-AFTRA National Board voted to put the power to call the strike in the hands of National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland -- a notable move and an early indicator that the union was preparing to finally make good on their repeated threats to walk away from the table.\n\nIn a statement of his own, Crabtree-Ireland said: \"The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the A.I. use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it's stunning that these video game studios haven't learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that.\"\n\nIt's been nearly two years since the Interactive Media Agreement was extended beyond its original expiration date to accommodate more talks between the union and the video game companies. Bargaining has continued on-and-off for that length of time. The union said Saturday that, while negotiations were ongoing, the parties \"remain far apart\" on artificial intelligence provisions.\n\nA.I. has been the sticking point on this contract for months, and a strike has been expected since Crabtree-Ireland spoke about the issue during a panel at SXSW in March.\n\nIn September, members authorized a strike authorization on this current contract. The vote was 98.32% in favor. A total of 34,687 members cast ballots, representing a voting 27.47% of eligible voters. SAG-AFTRA's last strike against the gaming companies, in 2016-17, lasted 183 days.\n\nThe news of another actors' strike comes just over a year after SAG-AFTRA went on strike against the major Hollywood studios, spending 118 days on the picket lines to achieve a new film and television contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Much like the Interactive Media Agreement, A.I. was a big point of contention in those talks and, ultimately, was one of the last points that the two parties reached an agreement on.\n\nWhile there was some pushback from members on the A.I. provisions in that contract, it was ratified with 78% approval in October.\n\nThis call to labor action from the actors guild comes as IATSE have ratified their new contracts with the studios, but as Hollywood Teamsters are still locked in bargaining with the AMPTP for a new three-year contract. Local 399 have extended talks twice now past their original July 19 deadline. With wage increases at the heart of the still unresolved negotiations, the Teamsters current contract with the studios expires on July 31.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Picketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The WB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindlight", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blindlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Take-Two Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomniac_Games", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insomniac Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fran Drescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_film_studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major film studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Producers", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alliance_of_Theatrical_Stage_Employees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Brotherhood_of_Teamsters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Brotherhood of Teamsters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_by_Southwest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South by Southwest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-SAG-AFTRA-Calls-Strike-Against-Major-Video-Game.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 302, "textEnd": 309}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 3747, "textEnd": 3754}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 3895, "textEnd": 3902}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

On Thursday, the union representing voice and motion-capture performers announced they would be walking off the job after talks with major video game companies broke down over concerns over AI protections. The work stoppage is set to begin Friday.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members,\" Fran Drescher, the president of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), which represents the performers, said in a prepared statement. \"Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.\"\n\nSeveral members of SAG-AFTRA are currently at Comic-Con International in San Diego for panels and other appearances. They will still be able to honor their obligations this weekend \"given the close proximity\" of the strike announcement to the event, which runs through Sunday. \"Solidarity,\" Dragon Age: The Veilguard voice actor Erika Ishii posted on X. \"We'll be fulfilling contracts at SDCC but afterwards we hold the line.\" Last year's Hollywood strikes greatly reduced the number of performers able to participate in Comic-Con events.\n\nTensions over AI between SAG members and major video game companies have been high for months. Negotiations between the two sides began in earnest in October 2022. Members voted to authorize a strike in September of 2023. \"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation,\" Sarah Elmaleh, SAG's negotiating chair for the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA) that covers video game workers, said in a statement. \"We refuse this paradigm -- we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer.\"\n\nIn the video game industry, actors regularly lend their voice, likeness, and even movements to projects. Voice acting and motion-capture are a crucial part of game development, even as AI begins to change the way developers create their games.

Cooling stated that their offer already \"extends meaningful A.I. protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers\" under the contract, and called the deal terms \"among the strongest in the entertainment industry.\"", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Take-Two Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2024/7/25/3008da6e/los-angeles-california-november.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&fm=jpg&fp-x=0.3743&fp-y=0.8116", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 249, "textEnd": 256}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

While a lot of progress has been made, SAG-AFTRA does not believe these media agreements offer enough protections against the use of AI \"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough,\" commented SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drecsher.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIts members voted to approve a strike last year, and now the union feels that it has no choice but to strike to get what it wants out of the updated contract. SAG-AFTRA wants \"clear and enforceable language\" that will protect its members from being taken advantage of by video game companies that use AI. The organization has already made some efforts to address this issue, but wants verbiage protecting its members codified in the next Interactive Media Agreement.\n\nThis work stoppage follows strikes that hit Hollywood last year over pay and AI-related issues. Starting at 12:01 a.m. on July 26, any actors who are members of SAG-AFTRA will no longer be able to participate in the production of games from companies who signed the initial Interactive Media Agreement and haven't agreed to the better terms in interim agreements that SAG-AFTRA has offered up.

The move comes after nearly two years of negotiations with video game giants, including divisions of Activision, Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Co., over a new interactive media deal.\n\nSag-Aftra negotiators say gains have been made on wages and job security in the video game contract, but studios will not reach an agreement on regulating generative AI. Without safeguards, game companies could train AI to mimic an actor's voice or create a digital replica of their image without consent or fair compensation, the union said.\n\nFran Drescher, the union's president, said in a prepared statement that members would not approve a contract that would allow companies to abuse AI.\n\n\"Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about proposing a deal that our members can live and work in, we will be there, ready to negotiate,\" Drescher said.\n\nA representative for the studios did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe global video game industry generates more than $100 billion in profits annually, according to gaming market forecasters NewzooThe people who design and bring these games to life are the driving force behind this success, Sag-Aftra said.\n\n\"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair and reasonable protections for AI, but rather in blatant exploitation,\" said Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh.\n\nLast month, union negotiators told The Associated Press that game studios were refusing to provide an equal level of protection from the dangers of AI to all of our members, especially movement artists.\n\nMembers voted overwhelmingly last year to give management the power to strike. Concerns about how movie studios will use AI has helped fuel Last year, film and television unions went on strike for four months.\n\nThe latest interactive contract, which expired in November 2022, did not include protections around AI but did guarantee a bonus pay structure for voice actors and performance capture artists after an 11-month strike that began in October 2016. The work stoppage marked Sag-Aftra's first major industrial action since the merger of Hollywood's two largest actors' unions in 2012.\n\nThe video game agreement covers more than 2,500 off-camera performers (voiceover), on-camera performers (motion capture, stunts), stunt coordinators, singers, dancers, puppeteers and background performers, according to the union.\n\nAmid tense interactive negotiations, Sag-Aftra created a separate contract in February covering low-budget and independent video game projects. The deal for low-budget, independent interactive media contains some of the AI protections that the video game industry titans have rejected.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fran Drescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interactive media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Elmaleh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Elmaleh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indie game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/History", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/History", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c24a7efacfc51612355086d16dc0b4fb17505736/0_345_5204_3124/master/5204.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c84dfbaf5ff4ea6b2864cb41a9154514", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-", "textStart": 2519, "textEnd": 2531}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The strike has been declared as of Thursday following \"more than a year and a half of negotiations\" seeking fair compensation and other protections with concerns and decisions regarding the usage of AI and video games chief among the topics being discussed. This video game strike will be effective as of July 26th, SAG-AFTRA said, with prepared statements specifically highlighting the AI issue.\n\nThe decision to strike was achieved with a nearly unanimous vote of 98.32% of members in favor of striking, according to SAG-AFTRA's announcement. Chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland shared a statement which highlighted some of the issues SAG-AFTRA's video game actors have taken with the use of AI in video games particularly in regards to how voices and likenesses will be used in projects which is a conversation that's extended to other mediums such as movies and animation as well.\n\n\"The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games,\" said Crabtree-Ireland. \"That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the A.I. use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it's stunning that these video game studios haven't learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that.\"\n\nOver on the SAG-AFTRA site, there's a search function where users can look up games to see if they'd be affected by this strike. Many of these games are naturally already out at this point, but since so many games get continued content updates and DLC, the strike can impact existing titles as well as upcoming ones. SAG-AFTRA said the bargaining group it was negotiating with included big companies like Activision, Electronic Arts, Insomniac Games, Take-Two, and WB Games, to name a few.\n\nIt is unclear how and to what degree this will affect upcoming and current releases at this time, but we should know more soon as the situation developers and SAG-AFTRA provides more updates.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The WB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Take-Two Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomniac_Games", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insomniac Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downloadable content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2023/09/26/26ddc780-cddf-4746-ae28-c8dcb22973ec/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-1.png?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 392, "textEnd": 401}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The union's decision to go on strike follows a strike authorization vote taken 10 months ago, and the work stoppage is scheduled to begin on July 26 at 12:01 a.m. The companies facing the strike include industry giants such as Activision Productions Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Epic Games Inc., and Warner Bros. Games Inc.\n\nSAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher expressed the union's frustration with the current state of negotiations, stating, \"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough.\" She emphasized that the union is ready to negotiate once the companies offer a contract that is fair and satisfactory to its members. This move marks a significant escalation in the union's efforts, with the authority to call the strike recently granted to National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland by the SAG-AFTRA National Board.\n\nCrabtree-Ireland highlighted the importance of fair treatment for SAG-AFTRA members, who play a crucial role in the video game industry. He pointed out that the billions in annual profits generated by the industry are driven by the creative talent of these performers. \"Our members deserve the same protections as those in film, television, streaming, and music,\" he said. This stance reflects ongoing concerns about the use of artificial intelligence, which has been a major sticking point in the contract negotiations.\n\nThe union's previous strike against video game companies in 2016-17 lasted 183 days and was driven by similar issues.

They'll be hitting the picket line a year after Hollywood actors and writers wrapped up their own historic strikes in an escalation that could have big consequences for the development and marketing of some of the industry's biggest games.\n\nMembers of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) voted last fall to authorize a strike citing an unwillingness of big game companies to budge on guaranteeing performers rights over how their work is used in training AI or creating AI-generated copies. Roughly 2,600 voice actors and motion capture artists, including talents like Troy Baker from The Last of Us, Jennifer Hale from Mass Effect, and Matt Mercer from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, have been working without an Interactive Media Agreement since November 2022. The strike starts on July 26 at 12:01 a.m.\n\n\"The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually.

Here's Why\n\nWhile games set to come out this fall like Dragon Age: The Veilguard, who's recently revealed voice cast includes several guild members, likely already have their voice and motion-capture work completed, the strike means SAG-AFTRA members would be unavailable for projects that are years out, and wouldn't be around to record for any potential last-minute re-writes for things that are closer to coming out. Games relied much less on actor performances in the past, but most popular franchises are now fully voice-acted, with the biggest-budget productions using motion capture to transfer actors' real-life performances, frame by frame, into the game.\n\nThe last time video game actors went on strike in 2016, it was primarily over pay rates and lasted a entire year. It's unclear if the strike this time around will be over any sooner. Unlike with the issue of higher pay, people involved in the current negotiations say that the lack of AI protections poses an existential threat to actors and their creative output. Just this week, Wired reported that companies like Activision Blizzard and Riot Games were moving ahead with using generative AI tools to help create concept art and even potentially assets that would make it into finished games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.\n\nSAG-AFTRA video game voice actors are set to hold a panel featuring Ashly Burch (Horizon Forbidden West), Noshir Dala (Red Dead Redemption II), and others at San Diego Comicon later this week on July 26.", "source": {"uri": "kotaku.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kotaku"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activision Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Tears_of_the_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Hale", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Hale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Mercer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Mercer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Baker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troy Baker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mass Effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Forbidden_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horizon Forbidden West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashly_Burch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashly Burch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dragon Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_Games", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Dead Redemption 2"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Six_Degrees_of_Separation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Six Degrees of Separation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/7328587e46bb17678da541acb2d63794.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1108, "textEnd": 1115, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Games, Insomniac Games and more. Now the union has called a strike.\n\nThe move has been signaled for nearly a year. Last September, nearly 35,000 of the union's members voted to authorize a strike (with 98 percent of members in favor) against the major gaming companies over the agreement, giving SAG-AFTRA's leadership the leeway to call a work stoppage. The contract had expired on November 7, 2022 and ever since the union has been operating on a month-to-month basis with the companies.\n\nThe union has said that pay has not kept pace with inflation and it has unaddressed concerns about gaming companies' use of artificial intelligence in the contracts of performers who make money using their voices and/or likenesses. On July 20, SAG-AFTRA's national board voted to give authority to chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland to call a strike.

The strike commences at 12:01 am on July 26 (so, shortly after midnight tonight) and any game studio looking to employ SAG-AFTRA-signed talent -- for voice work, motion capture performance, on-screen talent, or similar services -- must sign one of the new agreements listed in the union's post.\n\nThese include the Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement, the Interim Interactive Media Agreement, or the Interim Interactive Localization Agreement. According to the SAG-AFTRA site, those contracts are acceptable to the union because they include \"critical AI protections for members.\"\n\nAs the post notes, negotiations began in November 2022, and it lists major studios like Take 2 Productions, EA, Activision, WB Games, and more as part of the convenience bargaining group. It states, \"although agreements have been reached on many issues important to SAG-AFTRA members, the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their A.I. language.\"\n\nSimply put, this strike is largely due to the members seeking protection from potentially exploitative genAI technology. An unscrupulous studio looking to cut costs could hire a performer once and then use the assets to generate content without the actor's consent or compensation for their performance. The SAG-AFTRA members contend that this possibility -- and others that lack explicit consent regarding the re-use of a performance -- is harmful and undervalues their labor.\n\nSarah Elmaleh, Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee chair (and prolific video game voice actor, with credits in games like Final Fantasy XV, Fortnite, and Hi-Fi Rush) closes out the post with a statement to that effect.\n\n\"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable A.I. protections, but rather flagrant exploitation,\" said Elmaleh. \"We refuse this paradigm -- via we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer. We look forward to collaborating with teams on our Interim and Independent contracts, which provide A.I. transparency, consent and compensation to all performers, and to continuing to negotiate in good faith with this bargaining group when they are ready to join us in the world we all deserve.\"", "source": {"uri": "gamedeveloper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Game Developer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion capture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The WB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Take-Two Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Elmaleh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Elmaleh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-Fi_Rush", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hi-Fi Rush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortnite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Final Fantasy XV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blteab58b06ca35978a/66a2b9cb041b585ae70e88ed/sag_aftra_video_game_strike.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 350, "textEnd": 357}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Going into effect on July 26 at 12:01 a.m., SAG-AFTRA members will be striking against companies like Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, and more.\n\nThe main \"sticking point,\" as the Guild notes in its statement, are A.I. protections. Negotiations for a new contract with a bargaining group that includes the aforementioned publishers, as well as other major ones like Take-Two, Insomniac, and WB Games, have had A.I. as a focal point. Video game voice actors and motion capture actors are seeking protections against the creeping influence of A.I. in games. As SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher puts it:\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.\"\n\nThese negotiations began in October 2022 and have been ongoing, with the Guild approving a strike authorization vote in September 2023 with a 98.32% yes vote. The Guild says that some agreements have been reached on other issues, but it does seem like A.I. is the main cause for concern.\n\nIt may be warranted, too, as a recent Wired report explored how publishers like Activision Blizzard are already reportedly incorporating generative A.I. into development.\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for the companies said in a statement (via Kotaku) that they are \"disappointed\" the union has walked away, and they remain \"prepared\" to resume negotiations.\n\n\"We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions,\" said spokesperson Audrey Cooling. \"Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nVoice actors previously went on strike in 2016, over concerns about pay and royalties, among other issues. Where compensation was the concern then, it seems like the spread of tech that could have long-lasting implications on actors' livelihoods is now front and center.\n\n\"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable A.I. protections, but rather flagrant exploitation,\" said Sarah Elmaleh, Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair for the Guild. \"We refuse this paradigm - we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer. We look forward to collaborating with teams on our Interim and Independent contracts, which provide A.I. transparency, consent and compensation to all performers, and to continuing to negotiate in good faith with this bargaining group when they are ready to join us in the world we all deserve.\"\n\nAs for the effect this will have on development, that will likely be seen in the coming years rather than the here-and-now. The strike is likely to affect in-development games the most, though even games coming out soon may lose out on the chance for recording anything like re-writes.\n\nMeanwhile, a panel is planned for San Diego Comic-Con this weekend, featuring several SAG-AFTRA game actors discussing their craft. It's certainly going to be an even-higher interest panel now.", "source": {"uri": "destructoid.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Destructoid"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_van_allen@destructoid.com", "name": "Eric Van Allen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Activision Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The strike will start at 12:01 a.m. Pacific time on Friday, after more than a year and a half of negotiations.\n\nUntil the latest strike is resolved, members of the 160,000-person union will no longer \"act\" in video games produced by Activision Blizzard, WB Games, Electronic Arts and seven other companies covered by an interactive-media agreement. The agreement expired in November 2022, and last summer the union terminated an extension.\n\nSAG-AFTRA's demands are similar to those it sought from television and movie studios last year: higher wages and job protections from the threat of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members,\" Fran Drescher, the union's president, said in a statement. \"Enough is enough.\"\n\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union's executive director and chief negotiator, added, \"Frankly, it's stunning that these video game studios haven't learned anything from the lessons of the last year -- that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I.\"\n\nThe union also wants video game companies to improve safety on sets, such as having a medic on site.\n\n\"We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations,\" the consortium of companies said in a statement. \"Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful A.I. protections.\"\n\nThe companies added, \"We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions.\"\n\nThe union last went on strike against video game companies in 2016, for nearly a year.\n\nSome popular video games over the years have featured well-known actors, like Keanu Reeves, who appears in the dystopian sci-fi game Cyberpunk, and Samuel L. Jackson, who voices a character in a Grand Theft Auto game. But more often, video games are a starting point for more obscure actors looking to break into voice acting.\n\nThe union's strike against television and movie studios -- combined with a separate strike by the Writers Guild of America, which represents screenwriters -- brought Hollywood assembly lines to a standstill for six months last year.\n\nBlockbuster video games often take much longer to develop and produce than television episodes or movies, so any impact from a strike would not be visible to consumers for years, and even then the disruption to the industry could be minimal.

It's SAG-AFTRA's voice actors who bring characters to life in video games. They're concerned about possible rampant use of AI-cloned voices replacing their jobs. And the strike takes effect tonight, at 12:01 AM.\n\nThe struck companies include some of the biggest in Hollywood and beyond: Walt Disney-owned Disney Character Voices Inc., Sony-owned Insomniac Games Inc., and Warner Bros. Discovery's WB Games Inc. Others being struck are publishing giants Microsoft-owned Activision Productions,Take-Two Interactive (Take 2 Productions Inc.) and EA (Electronic Arts Productions Inc.), as well as Blindlight LLC, Formosa Interactive LLC, Llama Productions LLC, and VoiceWorks Productions Inc.\n\nThe lineup of struck companies may be somewhat different from last year's six months of strikes that crippled Hollywood. But the sticking point remains a familiar and perhaps even trickier one, controlling how AI can be used, in this case to create voices for in-game characters. Given that voice actors can have their voices \"cloned\" by readily available AI tools, or generated wholesale without an actor's involvement at all, the issue is seen as potentially devastating for the particular art of voice acting.\n\nActors and stunt performers also are widely used in motion-capture work to create the digital armatures for in-game characters.\n\nThe strike came after 19 months of negotiating, and months of leafletting and informational pickets by union members at industry events such as game awards and conferences. Union members authorized a strike last September after a year of negotiations, with 98.23% in favor, the union said.\n\n\"The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually,\" said SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, once again the union's lead negotiator. \"The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the A.I. use of their faces, voices, and bodies.\"\n\nSAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher, a notable and strident voice in last year's strike announcements, said \"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,\"\n\nThe video game industry has generated north of $180 billion in annual revenues for the past few years, but also has seen thousands of layoffs in the past year or so, in part as pandemic-era optimism about widespread uptake of gaming experiences tempered in the following return to normalcy.\n\nThe industry has been struggling to turn revenues into profits. The economics of premier AAA titles, which typically employ the biggest casts of voice actors, have shifted.\n\nNow such games typically require years-long development cycles and production budgets that rival major Hollywood movies, with very high stakes if the games fail. One example is the recent WG Games Suicide Squad title, a flop after last year's huge Harry Potter game success.\n\nThe mobile game space, which generates a majority of industry revenues, employs far fewer voice actors typically, but is also struggling with its most popular business models, including free-to-play titles that depend on \"whales,\" hard-core players who buy lots of in-game resources, or ads whose rates have flatlined amid vast inventory.\n\nAs with last year's studio deals, projects that want to use union-represented performers must sign one of three interim interactive-media agreements that include what the union calls \"critical A.I. protections for members.\"\n\nNotable examples of AI voice cloning include a recent deal by Hall of Fame sports announcer Al Michaels, who partnered with NBC to create an AI-generated version of his voice to narrate custom-generated daily newsletters of Olympic sports footage that the network is shooting for this year's Olympics.\n\nMichaels told a CNBC live audience that he was \"frightened and astonished at the same time\" when shown the cloned version of his voice, but decided to do the deal because, \"AI is here. Ready or not, here it comes. You can resist it or embrace it. I chose the latter.\"\n\nTwo years ago, James Earl Jones, long the menacing voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars films, was seeking to retire from the gig, now that he is 93. He agreed with Disney to allow a cloned version of his Vader voice, created by another actor using an app called Respeecher, for his voice part in the Obi-Wan Kenobi series and other future projects.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Take-Two Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Over 160,000 performers will refuse to work for major videogame makers including Activision, Disney, and EA until the companies agree to a contract with \"critical AI protections\" for union members.\n\nThe strike officially begins on July 26.\n\n\"Although agreements have been reached on many issues important to SAG-AFTRA members, the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their AI language,\" says the union.\n\nThe voice actors, who authorized the strike with a 98.32% \"yes\" vote, want big game makers to inform the union when they plan to use generative AI in a way that would replace the work of actors, and to negotiate compensation when they want to generate material based on an actor's voice or likeness.\n\nThe fear is that without sufficient protections for voice actors, game companies will cut costs by training AI systems on their work, allowing a developer to, for example, endlessly reproduce an actor's voice without hiring them to record new lines.\n\n\"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation,\" says actor and union negotiator Sarah Elmaleh. \"We refuse this paradigm -- we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer.\"\n\nGenerative AI voices will arguably never be able to perform as convincingly as real actors, but they have already proven a threat to voice actor livelihoods. Free-to-play FPS The Finals, for instance, uses AI text-to-speech software for its commentators rather than voice actors.\n\nThere are also examples in the wild of real actors having their voices replicated -- Stellaris uses generative AI voices based on the voices of actors, for instance, although Paradox pays royalties to the actors who provided the AI training material, which is the kind of agreement a contract with AI protections can require.\n\nThis new frontier of generative AI use can get very messy: One notable incident saw OpenAI use a voice that sounded very similar to Scarlett Johansson's, mimicking the Hollywood star's performance as an AI companion in the movie Her. The company said that it was not Johansson's voice -- it had hired an different actor -- but removed the voice \"out of respect for Ms. Johansson.\"\n\nAI voice generation and replication is also being used by non-professionals, in some cases to create material that actors vehemently object to, such as pornography. It's hard to stop hobbyists, but contractual protections could at least prevent game companies from exploiting an actor's likeness in work they didn't agree to.\n\nThe actors are looking for \"fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the AI use of their faces, voices, and bodies,\" says SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.\n\nSAG-AFTRA videogame actors previously went on strike in 2016 over residuals. That strike, which targeted the same subset of the games industry, lasted for nearly a year. It isn't entirely obvious how substantially it affected in-development games at the time, as big developers wouldn't have publicly attributed delays to the strike.

This comes not long after a failed negotiation attempt in the film industry that I'm sure you can remember easily. However, this latest hit directly relates to the gaming industry and AI.\n\nNow, AI is a touchy subject in a variety of areas. It's feared that AI will take over jobs, which could create some real problems. It's a warranted fear, as we've also seen AI make some truly outstanding leaps and bounds over the years. That's what the strike stems back to, as it seems that a deal can't be reached over the transparent use and consent of AI for all performers. Naturally, actors don't want AI to take over their bread and butter or attach their likeness to something they wouldn't have agreed to be a part of.\n\nThanks to a report from Rolling Stone, we're finding out that the strike was approved and will kick off on July 26, 2024, at 12:01 AM. Now, this didn't happen overnight. Instead, this was a deal the union had been working on for nearly two years. After not reaching a deal, they conducted a vote, which resulted in an official strike. That should hopefully speed up negotiations and strike up a deal that would appeal to both parties.\n\nWe're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live -- and work -- with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.\n\n- SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher\n\nSeveral companies will also find the strike to impact their productions.

The strike brings forward the complaints and concerns many have voiced over generative artificial intelligence for some time.\n\nSAG-AFTRA, the guild that represents screen actors as well as television and radio artists, has voted to authorize a video games strike. Releasing a full statement on its website, the guild noted that \"A.I. protections remain the sticking point\" in their agreements with major entertainment companies. SAG-AFTRA proposes that companies looking to hire guild members for their games must sign at least one of an array of agreements: The Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement, the Interim Interactive Media Agreement, or the Interim Interactive Localization agreement. These agreements that SAG-AFTRA has offered prioritize protections against the \"abuse of A.I.\"\n\nVideo game actors are rarely, if ever, compensated on the same level that actors in TV and movies do despite gaming routinely outpacing this media in generated revenue. One way that gaming giants have sought to cut costs and maximize profits has been through the use of generative AI. Companies see a large opportunity to save the money they would use to pay actors through the use of generative AI voice and face banks.\n\nMany actors have voiced how damaging this could be to them and the industry as a whole, but it hasn't stopped companies from using these tools anyway. Leading examples are companies like Square Enix, which used Midjourney in art for Foamstars, and Ubisoft, which is using an AI tool called Ghostwriter for NPC dialogue. Additionally, THE FINALS caught plenty of heat for using AI-generated voice actors in the majority of its dialogue.\n\nSAG-AFTRA negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland noted that gaming generates billions of dollars yearly and that there are many guild actors who join these projects and deserve fair compensation. He registered shock that the gaming industry hasn't seemed to move in accordance with the rest of the entertainment industry following the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes that lasted 148 days and 118 days, respectively.\n\nThis strike will begin on July 26 at 12:01am local time. It is unclear how long it will last, but as evidenced by 2023's strikes, which have been some of the guild's longest since the '80s, there are many people willing to fight to ensure fair compensation. SAG-AFTRA emphasized that this strike came as a last resort. Companies such as Take 2 Productions, Insomniac, Activision, EA, and WB Games have been named as companies bargained with in the failure to reach a deal, and this strike is a means toward forcing these companies' hand.\n\nIt's unclear what games will be affected by the strike, but titles that are shooting for a release beyond 4-6 months from now may face slowdowns, as those games are more likely to still need voice and acting work done, while games releasing before then are more likely to have completed that work. This could affect companies like Take-Two Interactive and Grand Theft Auto 6.\n\nA likelier bet is that some of the newest Kojima Productions titles will be slowed down by this strike. OD involves the likes of Hunter Schafer, an active guild member. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach involves Norman Reedus, Guillermo Del Toro, and Elle Fanning, who are all guild members as well.\n\nMany of the potential delays depend entirely on how long this strike plays out. SAG-AFTRA likely doesn't want this labor stoppage to last as long as others, but the guild has shown that it is ready to act.", "source": {"uri": "dotesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dot Esports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_byll@dotesports.com", "name": "Brett Byll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAG-AFTRA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAG-AFTRA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Drescher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fran Drescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghostwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-player character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Enix", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Square Enix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ubisoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The WB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Theft Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Stranding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death Stranding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elle_Fanning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elle Fanning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Reedus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norman Reedus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-Two_Interactive", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Take-Two Interactive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomniac_Games", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insomniac Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Writers Guild of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kojima_Productions", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kojima Productions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guillermo del Toro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Activision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Economy_and_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Economy and Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAG-AFTRA-Strike-logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764229", "eventUri": "eng-9764229", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 166, "textEnd": 173}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 2278, "textEnd": 2285}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

SAG-AFTRA was still negotiating new contracts for the video game industry, and didn't exactly seem close to an agreement. Things haven't changed much since then, so Ben writing that actors were preparing to strike again back in March wasn't surprising...which brings us to today.\n\nSAG-AFTRA confirms that its union members are going on strike today after more than a year and a half of negotiations. They highlight that progress has been made, but several video game companies and their performance production divisions continue to fight the actors' demands about protection against the use and abuse of artificial intelligence.\n\nLast year's film and TV strikes made it clear that this is an area the companies are ready to argue hard and long about, so it'll be interesting to see how long the video game strike will last when the use of AI has increased a lot lately and many higher-ups continue to tell investors that it's the future.\n\nIt's worth noting that we'll probably not see the consequences of this strike for a while, as games launching the in the near future have finished their performance capture and voice recordings. We might see it in a couple of years or so, however, as the game companies could be \"forced\" to either pause development or use actors that aren't in SAG-AFTRA.

The decision to hit the picket lines comes 10 months after the union's initial strike authorization vote. The strike goes into effect July 26 at 12:01 a.m.\n\nThe 10 companies facing the strike are Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Epic Games, Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Take 2 Productions Inc., VoiceWorks Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc.\n\nLast week, the SAG-AFTRA National Board voted to put the power to call the strike in the hands of National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland -- a notable move and an early indicator that the union was preparing to finally make good on their repeated threats to walk away from the table.\n\nIt's been nearly two years since the Interactive Media Agreement was extended beyond its original expiration date to accommodate more talks between the union and the video game companies. Bargaining has continued on-and-off for that length of time. The union said Saturday that, while negotiations were ongoing, the parties \"remain far apart\" on artificial intelligence provisions.\n\nA.I. has been the sticking point on this contract for months, and a strike has been expected since Crabtree-Ireland spoke about the issue during a panel at SXSW in March.\n\nIn September, members authorized a strike authorization on this current contract. The vote was 98.32% in favor. A total of 34,687 members cast ballots, representing a voting 27.47% of eligible voters. SAG-AFTRA's last strike against the gaming companies, in 2016-17, lasted 183 days.\n\nThe news of another actors' strike comes just over a year after SAG-AFTRA went on strike against the major Hollywood studios, spending 118 days on the picket lines to achieve a new film and television contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.

The core issue is pay and consent for performers involved in AI content. Negotiations have been active since October 2022.\n\nSAG-AFTRA -- the union best known for representing Hollywood performers -- is moving ahead with a strike against some major players in the video game industry, starting at 12:01AM on July 26. At stake is compensation and consent for the use of performers' voices and likenesses in AI content, which is likely to become increasingly common. The union has tackled similar issues in the movie and TV industries, and is looking to flex their power once again, this time targeting video game makers.\n\nRelated Should handheld gaming PCs get annual spec updates?\n\nFrequent updates might not be as great as you'd think.\n\nThe issue on the table\n\nNegotiations with game companies have been ongoing since October 2022, and some agreements have reportedly been reached on other topics. SAG-AFTRA says, however, that companies have refused to \"plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language\" that they'll sign on to an AI-related agreement when it comes to hiring unionized talent. In fact, union members voted to authorize a strike with a 98.32% majority as far back as September 2023.\n\nOn the other side of the dispute are some of the gaming industry's biggest players, including Activision Blizzard, EA, Disney, Take 2, and WB Games. Businesses like Activision have sometimes fought against unionization -- looking to minimize labor spending as game budgets rise -- but not always. Just this week, the Blizzard team working on World of Warcraft successfully formed a union with no resistance from management.\n\nWhy is AI such a big deal for video game performers?\n\nThe advent of generative AI may make it easier than ever for studios to exploit the images and voices of actors. A developer could, hypothetically, hire a voice actor to perform a script for a game, but then use AI to add lines they didn't agree to record, or even insert their voice into a completely different title. In the same vein, image generation tech has advanced to the point that an actor's face could be blended into characters they didn't agree to play.\n\nAll of this is a concern with movies and TV shows as well, but gaming has typically had little in the way of union protection, and more temptation to use every new tool available. Many games have become incredibly complex, taking several years to go from start to finish, with the need to tweak them repeatedly for the best gameplay.

{"id": 225043444, "title": "Renters hit with no-fault evictions as investors and corporate owners gain hold, advocates say", "text": "Four days after his Somerville apartment was purchased by an out-of-state investor in early February, Michael Prentky received a letter: His rent was about to go up $1,200, to $3,200 a month, on April 1. Should he and his partner opt not to renew their at-will tenancy in the three-unit building, Prentky needed to notify the property manager and give 30 days\u2019 notice, the letter said. \u201cI hate to be cynical, but I had been expecting it,\u201d Prentky, a 32-year-old musician, said recently as he stood outside his building at 22 Sargent Ave. Since 2018, he\u2019s lived there in Winter Hill in a three-bedroom apartment \u2014 which he described as effectively a two-bedroom, as the third is in disrepair. In the months since the purchase, negotiations over the rent hikes between tenants in the building and the new landlord have stalled. Prentky and a resident in another unit each have received summonses for no-cause evictions \u2014 the process allowing landlords to seek to remove tenants for no specific reason. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to get kicked out of my house,\u201d said Prentky, \u201cbut it seems like, trying to look ahead, that\u2019s the fate of things here.\u201d Housing advocates, tenant rights attorneys, and renters said these kinds of evictions \u2014 also known as \u201cno-fault evictions\u201d \u2014 are now part of a frequent pattern in Greater Boston, where investors and corporate buyers have become regular players in the housing market. \u201cNo-fault evictions are no doubt helping fuel the speculation in Massachusetts, and especially in what is traditionally housing for working people,\u201d said Eloise Lawrence, deputy faculty director of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, which provides legal services to low-income tenants facing eviction. That trend, advocates said, looks like this: Investors and corporate buyers purchase multifamily housing, then move quickly to raise rents and evict tenants for either failure to pay the higher fees or without cause. Even if tenants win their no-cause case in housing court, the matter remains on their record, advocates said. \u201cHaving that no-fault option means that tenants who have done absolutely nothing wrong, always paid their rent, always been good, model tenants \u2026 doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 [landlords] can wipe them out,\u201d Lawrence said. But property owners said no-cause evictions make up only a small fraction of evictions across Massachusetts and are a necessary resource to handle unruly renters or to make ends meet in an expensive real estate market \u2014 one in which investors can \u2014 and do \u2014 break even amid high interest rates, pricey mortgages, rising taxes, and climbing upkeep costs. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to operate as a small landlord, and anybody who thinks there\u2019s profit in it is kind of misunderstanding the reasons why landlords buy rental property in the first place,\u201d said Doug Quattrochi, executive director of MassLandlords, a nonprofit trade association. Evictions by the numbers Of the approximately 3,100 evictions initiated in Massachusetts in February, about 300 were no-cause cases, according to an analysis the Massachusetts Housing Partnership, a nonprofit that works to boost affordable housing across the Commonwealth, published in April. And that trend has largely remained consistent over the past 2\u00bd years, with no-cause evictions making up about 10 percent of all filings, said Matija Jankovic, a senior research analyst at MHP. But it is difficult to discern just how many of these filings were spurred by a landlord who purchased a property as an investment, Jankovic said. Often, corporate buyers and investors buy properties through limited liability companies, or LLCs, and real estate investment trusts and hedge funds, making it challenging to track ownership information. Additionally, some individual buyers establish LLCs to protect their privacy and for financial liability reasons. Still, evictions at large across the state have increased in recent years amid the rollback of COVID-19 pandemic-related renter protections. Prior to the pandemic, the average rate of total eviction filings was about 2,600 per month, Jankovic said. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a growing concern that just, generally speaking, if we stay at this rate of evictions \u2026 it\u2019s just, it\u2019s creating a lot of strain on our system to support tenants and people who are experiencing housing instability,\u201d he said. Landlords say eviction decisions are not so simple According to Ryan Pinto, who purchased 22 Sargent Ave. in Somerville earlier this year, rent increases at the three-unit building are necessary given its holding costs. Records show Pinto bought the building for $1.2 million. Without raising the rent, Pinto said, he\u2019s currently operating at around a $3,100-per-month loss with the below-market rents in place. The increases he\u2019s pursuing would help him just break even, he said, but that doesn\u2019t even include the cost of maintenance and repairs in a building well over a century old. He said he\u2019s willing to lose a few grand a year on the building, but at the current rate, the losses are simply unsustainable. \u201cThe holding costs are really, really high for that property,\u201d he said, pointing to a 7.87 percent interest rate, water and sewer rates, and property taxes that have jumped by about 20 percent since 2020. A California-based engineer, Pinto previously lived in the area and owns four other apartment buildings and one-single family home in Massachusetts, he said. He has tried to pursue other options for the Somerville property, including selling it to a local nonprofit, he said. That approach is one housing advocates often have praised as a way to maintain affordable housing in the region, and one Pinto said he also considers a viable solution to Greater Boston\u2019s housing woes. But the parties involved were unable to form a deal within Pinto\u2019s desired timeframe, according to both Pinto and Catherine Porter, an organizer at the Community Action Agency of Somerville who is working with the renters facing eviction. Pinto offered to accept housing vouchers and give cash to tenants who leave on their own. CAAS, meanwhile, sought to cap rent increases and asked Pinto to consider larger financial incentives for renters who left on their own accord. So far, no agreement has been reached. At this point, Pinto said, he has been left with no choice but to pursue the no-cause evictions, which he said are sometimes necessary for landlords like himself who are facing tough economic scenarios. \u201cThey are absolutely vital,\u201d he said. \u201cThey serve as a checks and balance \u2026 without that, the business is not viable.\u201d Quattrochi does not believe no-cause evictions are necessarily a phenomenon exclusive to real estate investors. He also rejects the notion those buyers are abusing them, as housing advocates suggest. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s abused. It\u2019s not growing at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think it\u2019s a mischaracterization from the renter side about what landlords actually have at stake when they go to court.\u201d In many instances, these cases follow other attempts at eviction, such as those over nonpayment of rent, he said. \u201cYou look at the 12 percent of filings on an annual basis that are no-cause stated, and they\u2019re very often associated with failed for-cause cases or other cases the landlord couldn\u2019t move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see patterns of repeat evictions because the first one doesn\u2019t stick.\u201d Renters and advocates want legislative protections On a weekday evening in mid-May, more than 50 people crowded on the sidewalk and driveway for a rally at 22 Sargent Ave., listening as renters facing eviction and others called for solutions to keep them in their homes. \u201cThe landlords can punch down, evicting at will with no repercussions, and we have no recourse. In fact, the eviction will permanently tarnish our records,\u201d Prentky said, reading from prepared remarks. \u201cBy allowing landlords to act in this way with impunity, Massachusetts and the city of Somerville are tacitly accepting bullying of poor folks in favor of landlords. This rule cannot remain. No-fault evictions need to be expunged from tenant records.\u201d Indeed, Prentky worries about what an eviction could mean for his future renting prospects, especially when he\u2019s always paid his rent on time, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally a landlord\u2019s market,\u201d said Lawrence, of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. \u201cThe landlord, all they need to do is take a quick scan, and they don\u2019t care what the eviction is for.\u201d Katherine Fustich, a housing attorney for the De Novo Center for Justice and Healing who is representing the renters at 22 Sargent Ave., said renters facing no-cause evictions have many opportunities to raise counterclaims and defenses in court. \u201cWhat I tell tenants all the time is that in a no-fault eviction case, your counterclaims only have to be worth $1\u201d for you to be able to stay in your home, she said. \u201cBasically, for you to win the case, if you owe your landlord $0 \u2014 you\u2019re current on rent \u2014 you just have to prove to a judge or a jury that you have suffered $1 worth of damages from your landlord.\u201d Still, some said reforms are needed to protect renters better, especially because these cases can follow them long after they win in court. Advocates with CAAS, the organizers behind the recent tenant rally, have called on lawmakers to lift the statewide ban on rent control and to enact the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which, if it becomes law, would require property owners to grant their renters or a selected representative, such as a land trust or nonprofit, the option of first refusal when their building goes up for sale. Another bill, cosponsored by state Representative Samantha Monta\u00f1o, a Boston Democrat, would set certain conditions for landlords who want a unit back from a tenant in good standing, such as when they intend to convert the apartment into a condominium or move into it themselves. \u201cI think that the narrative that\u2019s often put out around this is that we\u2019re looking for ways to have people squat indefinitely or just give no power to the landlord, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case,\u201d Monta\u00f1o said. \u201cIt\u2019s just saying if you have a perfectly good tenant who\u2019s paying their rent \u2026 and you just want an opportunity to make more money, we\u2019re not in favor of that. We\u2019d like to see more community stabilization.\u201d Prentky, who grew up on the South Shore and moved to Boston in 2010, said he\u2019s watched friends leave over the years because of the region\u2019s high cost of housing. \u201cThe brain drain is so strong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like Boston is trying to push them out. They\u2019re not even trying to keep people stable, and it\u2019s destroying communities \u2014 it\u2019s destroying the city.\u201d Christopher Gavin can be reached at [email protected].", "summary": "<p>Even if tenants win in housing court, the matter remains on their record.

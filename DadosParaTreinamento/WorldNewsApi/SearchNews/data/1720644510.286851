We knew an inheritance was coming, but it was easily three times what we thought it would be. My day-to-day life didn't change. I still work the same job, and so does my husband. Everything is the same except for the relief we have when thinking about the future, which is huge. We took half the money and put it in an account for our kids. Their college, grad school, etc., are completely paid for. We then took the other half and hired an advisor we know well to invest it for our retirement. We plan to park it until we both stop working, which is still decades away. We also cut big checks to our beloved niece (for school in the future) and two charities close to our hearts. The thought that our future is secure is breathtakingly amazing.\"", "summary": "<h1>\"I'm a lot more confident about asking for raises because I know I can comfortably quit any time.\"</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/6/19/enhanced/dd1c0f1a1bc6/original-1600-1717703089-3.jpg?crop=1243:829;0,0\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahdobro/unexpected-money-changing-lives\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahdobro/unexpected-money-changing-lives", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/6/19/campaign_images/683ab2ceeea6/people-who-came-into-a-large-sum-of-money-unexpec-3-1557-1717703558-0_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:16:02", "author": "Hannah Dobrogosz,https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "authors": ["Hannah Dobrogosz", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.11}

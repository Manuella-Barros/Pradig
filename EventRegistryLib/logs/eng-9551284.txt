Mandatory Credit: Mike Dinovo-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFormer NFL cornerback Buster Skrine was arrested last year over an alleged fraudulent banking scheme, and it appears he is now on the run from police.\n\nSkrine was arrested in Toronto, Canada, last August on charges related to bank fraud. Police in the Regional Municipality of Durham said Skrine used fraudulent checks to withdraw more than $100,000 in cash from numerous banks over a period of roughly one year. Skrine was trying to travel back to the United States at the time of his arrest.\n\nSkrine had been out on bail since April 12. According to Chris Doucette of the Toronto Sun, the conditions of Skrine's release required him to wear a GPS ankle monitoring device and remain in Ontario unless he had a court appearance in another province.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Durham Regional Police Service announced that they are searching for Skrine. The 35-year-old did not show up to his scheduled court appearance on Monday, and his GPS monitoring device has gone offline. Skrine is now wanted on additional charges of failure to appear and failure to comply with a release order.\n\nSkrine played for the Tennessee Titans in 2021 before announcing his retirement the following offseason. He was drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round in 2011 and went on to play for the New York Jets, Chicago Bears, San Francisco 49ers and then Titans. Skrine finished his career with 10 interceptions.\n\nIt is unclear what Skrine's financial situation was at the time he committed the alleged fraud, but the former University of Tennessee Chattanooga star made more than $40 million on the field during his career.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_delvecchio@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Steve DelVecchio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Skrine", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buster Skrine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_Regional_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Durham Regional Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Durham, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Durham, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tennessee_at_Chattanooga", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Tennessee at Chattanooga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Buster-Skrine-1-600x338.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551284", "eventUri": "eng-9551284", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-16", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 12}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-12", "textStart": 735, "textEnd": 743}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

That's a change from the GOP's 2016 and 2020 platforms that supported legislation that would have imposed a 20-week federal abortion ban -- language that Trump ran on both cycles.\n\nFull RNC membership will vote to officially confirm the platform from the convention floor, according to an RNC spokesperson. The party's convention takes place next week in Milwaukee. Trump dialed into the meeting Monday morning and \"described why some parts are in\" the platform, according to the committee member. During the meeting, Trump also expressed his approval of a draft of the new Republican Party platform, according to a source familiar with the meeting.\n\nTrump took a victory lap after the platform committee voted to approve a new overhauled party platform plan to better align with his political posture.\n\n\"Ours is a forward-looking Agenda with strong promises that we will accomplish very quickly when we win the White House and Republican Majorities in the House and Senate. We are, quite simply, the Party of Common Sense! America needs determined Republican Leadership at every level of Government to address the core threats to our very survival,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform.\n\nThe platform's mention of abortion, however, came near the end of the full document. It is not included as part of the platform's 20 principles that are prioritized first in the language. The first two of those principals call to \"seal the border\" and \"carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.\" Those are followed by \"end inflation\" and \"make America the dominant energy producer in the world.\" Notably, the U.S. is already the top global oil producer.\n\nOther points include \"large tax cuts for workers and no tax on tips,\" \"defend our constitution,\" \"prevent World War III\" by restoring peace in Europe and the Middle East and putting an end to \"weaponization\" of the government.\n\nA political party's platform distinctly outlines its positions on foreign and domestic policies, but it is not binding and doesn't directly impact the work of elected officials or candidates.\n\nMonday's move by the committee comes as abortion remains a key issue for voters in an election year in what is expected to be a close race between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nIn 2016, the Republican Party -- on their way to nominating Trump for the first time -- adopted a strict, conservative platform around issues of gender and sexual orientation against the efforts by some of the party's more moderate faction to soften that language. An identical platform was approved in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic made it difficult for party committees to convene and adjust language. During that convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump was chosen as the party's nominee for a second time.\n\nTrump's position on reproductive rights has worried some anti-abortion activists and RNC members who have expressed concern that the call for a \"right to life\" amendment would be stripped from the platform this year.\n\nA platform committee member who spoke with ABC News following the vote, which passed 84-14, said there was a lot of \"unanimity\" around the language, even from some of the more socially conservative members who have been vocally opposing a platform reflective of Trump's abortion stances.\n\n\"We had a whole bunch of people stand up and go the microphone [during a comment section]. And for the most part, things were really quite upbeat. People were happy to see this document,\" the member said.\n\nFollowing the vote, SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser -- a major antiabortion leader and one of the individuals lobbying the Trump team about the platform this year -- released a statement supporting the document.\n\n\"It is important that the GOP reaffirmed its commitment to protect unborn life today through the 14th Amendment. Under this amendment, Congress enacts and enforces its provisions. The Republican Party remains strongly pro-life at the national level.\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202fThe mission of the pro-life movement, for the next six months, must be to defeat the Biden-Harris extreme abortion agenda,\" Dannenfelser wrote.\n\n\"The platform allows us to provide the winning message to 10 million voters, with four million visits at the door in key battleground states,\" Dannenfelser added.\n\nBut others, including Gayle Ruzicka, a Republican National Committee platform member from Utah, told ABC affiliate WISN that she was disappointed with how the platform vote was \"forced\" on committee members and with how it handled abortion.\n\n\"I'm extremely disappointed that we do not have any pro-life language. There are good things in this platform. ... This is the first time we don't have a pro-life platform. The platform simply says that we oppose late-term abortion. Well, what about before that?\" Ruzicka said.\n\nAt a political event in Waukesha, Wisconsin, following the vote on Monday afternoon, RNC Chairman Michael Whatley dispelled notions that the platform was weak on the issue of abortion.\n\n\"We have a very solid pro-life platform. We feel very, very solid about it. I think you can just look at the number of pro-life groups from across the country that have come in and said that they strongly support this platform. Look, the Republican Party stands for life. And we are always going to stand for life. I think when you look at this platform, you're going to see that it is very pro-America. It is very pro-family. It is very pro-life. And we feel very strong about the language that we have,\" Whatley said.\n\nThe Biden campaign responded to the GOP platform's softened language on abortion by reinforcing their stance that Trump, should he regain the presidency, would not be moderate on the issue.\n\n\"Despite Trump and his team's best efforts, the American people are clear on just how far he would go to rip away their freedoms - and they'll vote accordingly this November,\" Biden-Harris 2024 Spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "endtimeheadlines.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

The new platform, which was quickly approved Monday by the RNC platform committee, reflects Trump's broader policy agenda on a range of issues as the presumptive Republican nominee continues to reshape the party in his third run for the White House.\n\n\"Ours is a forward-looking Agenda with strong promises that we will accomplish very quickly when we win the White House and Republican Majorities in the House and Senate,\" Trump said in a social media post Monday, praising the new platform.\n\nOn abortion, the updated language mirrors Trump's position in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v.

The new platform, which was quickly approved by the RNC's platform committee on Monday, reflects Trump's broader policy agenda on a range of issues as the presumptive Republican nominee continues to reshape the party in his third run for the White House.\n\n\"Our platform is forward-looking, with powerful promises that we will deliver very quickly when we win the White House and Republican majorities in the House and Senate,\" Trump said in a social media post Monday, praising the new platform.\n\nOn abortion, the updated language reflects Trump's position following the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which said restrictions should now be left to the states.\n\nWe believe that the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that no person shall be denied life or liberty without due process of law, and that states are therefore free to enact laws protecting these rights, reads a draft document obtained by CNN. The new platform does not mention a national abortion ban, a policy that some social conservatives have wanted to see included but which the former president has publicly said he opposes.\n\nAfter the platform was released, a prominent anti-abortion group, SBA Pro-Life America, released a statement saying the platform reaffirms the party's commitment to protecting life through the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe updated platform, titled \"America First: A Return to Common Sense,\" also no longer defines marriage as the union of one man and one woman.\n\nRather than focusing on reducing the national debt, the platform calls for ending inflation and making America affordable again. The document also lays out Trump's position on Social Security and Medicare, reaffirming the former president's stance against cutting welfare benefits.\n\nThe new platform amplifies rhetoric Trump frequently used during his election campaign, focusing on immigration and calling for a border closure. It also calls for an end to the use of government as a weapon against the American people.\n\nThe platform was approved by a landslide vote of 84 to 18 in a closed-door vote, the source said.\n\nThe platform will be taken up again at the party's full convention, which begins in Milwaukee next week.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

He's carved out a middle-of-the-road approach while on the campaign trail, saying the issue should be left to the discretion of the states. During the recent presidential debate, he also voiced support for the Supreme Court's decision upholding access to the abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nThe life issue has been viewed by some on the right as an electoral liability since the high court overturned Roe v. Wade, which conferred a constitutional right to an abortion, in its 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. Congressional Republicans have also distanced themselves from support for a national abortion ban, according to NOTUS reporter Haley Byrd Wilt.\n\nThe new platform document takes a softened approach on many social issues and is less detailed overall on exact policies than previous versions. The platform reflects key campaign issues for Trump, such as addressing inflation, calling for tariffs on trade, and a tough stance on immigration that, while light on specifics, calls for mass deportations.\n\nIn 2020, Republicans chose not to write a new party platform, merely carrying over the 2016 platform. For the past two campaign cycles, the platform devoted over 700 words to abortion and the life issue. It endorsed the \"sanctity of human life,\" weighed in on policy specifics such as congressional legislation and court decisions, and pledged that the GOP would seek a federal abortion ban that limited the procedure after 20 weeks gestation.\n\nIn contrast, the considerably pared-down platform for 2024 gives the issue 110 words. The new platform argues that the 14th Amendment, which says that states may not deprive any person the right to life, liberty, or property without due process, means \"the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights.\"\n\nThe document goes on to voice opposition to \"late term abortion\" -- the only time the word abortion is used -- and says the Republican Party will support policies that support mothers and prenatal care, as well as access to birth control and in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n\"This is pro-choice language, in keeping with Trump's pro-choice position. The sleight of hand is that it seems to claim the 14th Amendment applies to the unborn. But if the GOP believes that's true, then the federal government, not just the states, has a duty to protect life,\" wrote Joe Carter, in a piece for The Gospel Coalition. \"The platform does no such thing. It gives broad support for IVF (even when it causes the death of a child) and only lists opposition to late-term abortion.\"\n\nOn Monday, the platform committee approved the new document behind closed doors in an 84-18 vote. The New York Times also reported that Trump was laser focused on watering down the language on abortion.\n\nFamily Research Council president Tony Perkins, who was a member of the platform committee, called the process \"choreographed\" in a statement and said it allowed for \"no amendments to be discussed and voted upon.\"\n\nHe said that delegates had to vote on the platform the same day they received it, without sufficient review time, and were only afforded a few minutes for discussion before the vote was taken.\n\nPerkins is among a group on the platform committee that submitted a minority report arguing for stronger language on the abortion issue. The report calls for the addition of a \"human life amendment,\" arguing for language that better reflects the long-standing GOP position on abortion.\n\nFamily Research Council is also part of a recently launched initiative called the Platform Integrity Project, which seeks to preserve a strong stance on the \"pro-life, pro-family, and pro-freedom\" elements of the GOP platform.\n\nIt's unclear whether delegates like Perkins will have a chance to address the issue at next week's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the platform will be adopted.\n\nIn past years, Republican activists have been able to shape the party's platform in ways that at times deviated from the presumptive nominee's own statements. But that process has changed during the Trump years. The Wall Street Journalreported that, this year, Trump edited the document prior to its presentation to the platform committee.\n\nSome pro-life activists refrained from criticizing the new platform. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement that \"it is important that the GOP reaffirmed its commitment to protect unborn life today through the 14th Amendment. ... The Republican Party remains strongly pro-life at the national level.\"\n\nThe platform also dropped language condemning the Supreme Court's 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage and omitted references to \"traditional marriage.\"\n\nIt instead addresses transgender issues at several points: \"We will keep men out of women's sports, ban taxpayer funding for sex change surgeries, and stop taxpayer-funded schools from promoting gender transition, reverse Biden's radical rewrite of Title IX education regulations, and restore protections for women and girls,\" the document reads.\n\n\"Any effort to weaken the Republican Party's commitment to life and marriage would be a mistake,\" Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said.\n\n\"On abortion, many states are becoming a black hole for the most vulnerable. Donald Trump won the 2016 election on the GOP's most pro-life platform in US history. It's both bad politics and wrong morally to weaken the party's commitment to the most vulnerable,\" Aaron Baer, president of the Ohio-based Center for Christian Virtue, told CT.\n\n\"For all those consoling themselves that the GOP is still better than the alternative on abortion, keep in mind that being a little less pro-choice than the Democrats is not a pro-life position,\" Southern Baptist Theological Seminary professor Denny Burk commented.\n\nIn an article for World, Burk wrote that \"pro-lifers understood the deal they were making in 2016 when they turned out to vote for the Republican candidate,\" referencing Trump's pledge to appoint justices that would overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"But now it looks as if Trump is altering the deal for his possible second term -- a deal that has eviscerated the pro-life plank of the Republican Party platform,\" Burk wrote.\n\nThe economy tends to be the top priority for American voters, though many pastors list a candidate's position on abortion and religious freedom as top factors in their vote.\n\nSome social conservatives see the change as frustrating to the point where they're considering withdrawing their support for Trump altogether.\n\n\"Dear GOP, I've said for years that I won't vote for any politician, or support any party, that doesn't stand fully against abortion from conception until birth. That's not going to change in 2024,\" Greg Gilbert, pastor of Third Avenue Baptist Church in Louisville, said on the social platform X. \"How many voters like me are you comfortable losing?\"", "source": {"uri": "christianitytoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ChristianityToday.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The 2016 platform weighed in at roughly 66 pages. The new version came in at just 16 pages.\n\nThe platform's section on abortion was significantly softened from the 2016 document.\n\nWATCH: WHAT RNC CHAIR WHATLEY TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT THE GOP CONVENTION\n\nFollowing Trump's lead, the document spotlights that abortion is best handled by the states.\n\n\"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights,\" the draft reads.\n\nHowever, for the first time in 40 years, the document makes no mention of a federal abortion ban, which the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has emphasized that he opposes.\n\nInstead, the new platform stresses, \"We will oppose late term abortion while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nIn a letter spotlighted by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, seven evangelical and anti-abortion leaders - including Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed and SBA Pro-Life America president Marjorie Dannenfelser - gave their support to the platform.\n\n\"President Donald J. Trump has a clear track record of keeping his promises. During his first term, we pro-life and pro-family leaders applauded his courageous leadership,\" the letter highlighted. \"We support President Trump's vision and his commitment reflected in the Platform to the causes that millions of Americans hold so dear - protecting life and promoting the family.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone was happy.\n\n\"I am concerned the Republican Party is moving away from its strong, definitive goal of protecting children from the moment of conception,\" Tony Perkins, president of the influential Family Research Council, wrote on social media.\n\nBrent Leatherwood, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, which is the public policy wing of the Southern Baptist Convention, took to social media to argue that \"now is the time to advocate for a robust vision for life -- at all levels of government -- not retreat from it.\"\n\nAdditionally, ahead of the vote, a policy group aligned with former Vice President Mike Pence - who has long been a champion for evangelical voters - urged the convention delegates on the platform committee not to purge the anti-abortion language.\n\nThe platform switch on the issue comes as a slew of polls indicate that a solid majority of Americans oppose a federal ban on abortion. The last survey - released early Wednesday from the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research - indicated that roughly six in ten Americans said their state should allow a person to legally obtain an abortion.\n\nFourteen GOP-dominated states have implemented full bans with limited exceptions, since the conservative majority on the Supreme Court two years ago overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which had legalized abortion nationwide. Three other states prohibit abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe platform also abandoned long-standing language opposing same-sex marriage.\n\nOn economic issues, the platform does not spotlight reducing the national debt and instead calls to \"end inflation\" and \"Make America Affordable again.\"\n\nIn a major break from past precedent on trade issues, the platform now supports tariffs.\n\nThe document also highlights Trump's pledge against cutting Social Security or Medicare.\n\nMarc Short, a director of legislative affairs in the Trump administration and a chief of staff for then-Vice President Pence who this cycle served as a top adviser on Pence's unsuccessful presidential campaign, took aim at the planks.\n\n\"Embracing tariffs and avoiding addressing entitlement spending, have been mainstays of the Democrat party. Adopting massive tax increases ( tariffs) as part of the Republican platform will not lead to economic prosperity,\" Short argued.\n\nThe platform also included much of the language and rhetoric Trump uses on the campaign trail, including calls for the U.S. border with Mexico to be sealed and urging an end to \"the weaponization of government against the American people.\"\n\n\"It doesn't say we're not going to support this or that. It just focuses on the broad issues that everybody knows we're going to support,\" said a delegate who supported the platform who asked for anonymity to speak more freely.\n\nThe delegate told Fox News that the new platform \"is something that I can go out and sell. It's very simple, straightforward, very readable and very understandable.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign took aim at the document, charging that \"Donald Trump's policy \"platform\" reads more like the screed of an unhinged and unwell conspiracy theorist who hates America and is in it for himself.\"\n\nThe platform is expected to be easily approved at the full party convention next week.\n\nGet the

Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned prior precedent declaring abortion as a constitutional right.\n\nTrump later lashed out at critics of that position on social media, including Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, who had demanded GOP federal candidates embrace a federal minimum 15-week abortion limit and warned the organization \"According to national health statistics, that proposed ban -- without taking into account exceptions -- would have affected approximately 6% of abortions in the U.S. while leaving the overwhelming majority of abortions legally protected. Nearly nine out of 10 abortions take place within the first trimester.\n\nThe text of the new GOP platform, released July 8 by the Trump campaign, states that Republicans will \"protect and defend a vote of the people, from within the states, on the issue of life.\" The document stated the party believes the 14th Amendment \"guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.\"\n\n\"After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People,\" it added. \"We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nThe party's previous platform -- last updated in 2016 -- included a call for a 20-week federal abortion ban that was removed from Trump's version. That proposed national ban would have affected little more than 1% of all abortions in the U.S.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump argued, \"We are, quite simply, the Party of Common Sense!\"\n\nPro-life activists previously sent a letter asking RNC delegates \"to support pro-life planks and vote down any platform that weakens the party's commitment to the cause of life.\"\n\nSignatories on the letter included Dannenfelser, who had warned in a July 2 statement, \"If the Trump campaign decides to remove national protections for the unborn in the GOP platform, it would be a miscalculation that would hurt party unity and destroy pro-life enthusiasm between now and the election.\"\n\nHowever, in a July 8 statement, Dannenfelser asserted that under the new platform, \"The Republican Party remains strongly pro-life at the national level.\"\n\n\"It is important that the GOP reaffirmed its commitment to protect unborn life today through the 14th Amendment,\" she said. \"Under this amendment, it is Congress that enacts and enforces its provisions.\"\n\nDannenfelser, whose group works to elect pro-life candidates to public office, argued the new platform \"allows us to provide the winning message to 10 million voters, with four million visits at the door in key battleground states.\" She said the \"mission of the pro-life movement, for the next six months, must be to defeat the Biden-Harris extreme abortion agenda.\"\n\nBut former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's former running mate -- who later broke with the former president over his unfounded claims of a stolen election and actions surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot -- called the platform change a \"profound disappointment to the millions of pro-life Republicans that have always looked to the Republican Party to stand for life.\"\n\n\"Now is not the time to surrender any ground in the fight for the right to life,\" Pence said in a statement. \"The 2024 platform removed historic pro-life principles that have long been the foundation of the platform. I urge delegates attending next week's Republican Convention to restore language to our party's platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.\"\n\nPence argued the new platform \"also cedes this fight to the states, leaving the unborn in California and Illinois to the far-left's extremist abortion policies.\"\n\n\"The right to life is not only a state issue; it is a moral issue, and our party must continue to speak with moral clarity and compassion about advancing the cause of life at the federal, state and local level,\" he said.\n\nPence argued the Dobbs decision \"did not return the question of abortion to the states only but to the elected representatives of the people.\"\n\n\"Every life, born and unborn, is precious and deserving of their rights endowed by their Creator. The 14th amendment, though rightly cited, will not protect the unborn across the country without further federal action,\" Pence said.\n\nHe argued the platform \"is part of a broader retreat in our party, trying to remain vague for political expedience.\"\n\n\"The GOP platform may be retreating, but we in the pro-life movement never will,\" Pence said.\n\nOn several occasions, Trump has blamed the issue of abortion and pro-life voters for the Republican Party's underperformance in the 2022 midterm election cycle. Analysts, by contrast, blamed in part quality issues with Republican campaigns in that cycle and Trump's repeated, unproven claims of a stolen 2020 election for the party's underperformance.\n\nHowever, several states have enacted abortion protections as the result of ballot measures since Dobbs: voters in Ohio, California, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Vermont and Kansas either rejected new limitations on abortion or expanded legal protections for it. But abortion itself will be on the ballot again in several states in November, including Florida, Nevada and likely Arizona, where closely-watched races for the U.S. Senate are also taking place.", "source": {"uri": "thedialog.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dialog"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kate_scanlon@thedialog.org", "name": "Kate Scanlon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Dannenfelser", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Dannenfelser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_B._Anthony_Pro-Life_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan B.

The 2016 platform weighed in at roughly 66 pages. The new version came in at just 16 pages.\n\nThe platform's section on abortion was significantly softened from the 2016 document.\n\nWATCH: WHAT RNC CHAIR WHATLEY TOLD FOX NEWS ABOUT THE GOP CONVENTION\n\nFollowing Trump's lead, the document spotlights that abortion is best handled by the states.\n\n\"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights,\" the draft reads.\n\nHowever, for the first time in 40 years, the document makes no mention of a federal abortion ban, which the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has emphasized that he opposes.\n\nInstead, the new platform stresses, \"We will oppose late term abortion while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nIn a letter spotlighted by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, seven evangelical and anti-abortion leaders - including Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed and SBA Pro-Life America president Marjorie Dannenfelser - gave their support to the platform.\n\n\"President Donald J. Trump has a clear track record of keeping his promises. During his first term, we pro-life and pro-family leaders applauded his courageous leadership,\" the letter highlighted. \"We support President Trump's vision and his commitment reflected in the Platform to the causes that millions of Americans hold so dear - protecting life and promoting the family.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone was happy.\n\n\"I am concerned the Republican Party is moving away from its strong, definitive goal of protecting children from the moment of conception,\" Tony Perkins, president of the influential Family Research Council, wrote on social media.\n\nBrent Leatherwood, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, which is the public policy wing of the Southern Baptist Convention, took to social media to argue that \"now is the time to advocate for a robust vision for life -- at all levels of government -- not retreat from it.\"\n\nAdditionally, ahead of the vote, a policy group aligned with former Vice President Mike Pence - who has long been a champion for evangelical voters - urged the convention delegates on the platform committee not to purge the anti-abortion language.\n\nThe platform also abandoned long-standing language opposing same-sex marriage.\n\nOn economic issues, the platform does not spotlight reducing the national debt and instead calls to \"end inflation\" and \"Make America Affordable again.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a major break from past precedent on trade issues, the platform now supports tariffs.\n\nThe document also highlights Trump's pledge against cutting Social Security or Medicare.\n\nMarc Short, a director of legislative affairs in the Trump administration and a chief of staff for then-Vice President Pence who this cycle served as a top adviser on Pence's unsuccessful presidential campaign, took aim at the planks.\n\n\"Embracing tariffs and avoiding addressing entitlement spending, have been mainstays of the Democrat party. Adopting massive tax increases ( tariffs) as part of the Republican platform will not lead to economic prosperity,\" Short argued.\n\nThe platform also included much of the language and rhetoric Trump uses on the campaign trail, including calls for the U.S. border with Mexico to be sealed and urging an end to \"the weaponization of government against the American people.\"\n\n\"It doesn't say we're not going to support this or that. It just focuses on the broad issues that everybody knows we're going to support,\" said a delegate who supported the platform who asked for anonymity to speak more freely.\n\nThe delegate told Fox News that the new platform \"is something that I can go out and sell. It's very simple, straightforward, very readable and very understandable.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign took aim at the document, charging that \"Donald Trump's policy \"platform\" reads more like the screed of an unhinged and unwell conspiracy theorist who hates America and is in it for himself.\"\n\nThe platform is expected to be easily approved at the full party convention next week.", "source":

The proposed party platform, backed by Trump, softened the GOP's language on abortion and same-sex marriage.\n\nAccording to a copy of the document obtained by The Washington Post, the platform proposal states: \"After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the states and to a vote of the people.\" While the document clarifies that the GOP will oppose late-term abortion, the party will also advocate for policies that \"advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nThe Republican Party's 2024 platform has drawn criticism from some pro-life leaders and organizations.\n\nFamily Research Council President Tony Perkins said in a statement on Monday that while the 2024 platform includes campaign priorities, it is not \"a declaration of enduring principles for a political party.\" Perkins, a member of the RNC Platform Committee from Louisiana, claimed that delegates were not given enough time to review the platform.\n\n\"Delegates were only given a few minutes of discussion before 'debate' was ended and a vote was taken,\" the FRC president said. \"Ironically, the document calls for a vigorous defense of free speech and the end of government censorship. Deprived of the opportunity to discuss amendments to the 'draft' platform document, we have submitted a minority report to supplement that campaign's platform.\"\n\n\"The submission of a minority report is further evidence that the pro-life movement will continue to advance pro-life principles and policies at every level of government,\" Perkins added. \"The right to life transcends other political debates and the interests of any and all political parties and candidates. It is truly the right without which no other right has any meaning.\"\n\nLive Action Founder and President Lila Rose released a statement Monday that denounced abortion as \"the intentional destruction of an innocent human life.\" The pro-life leader called it a \"devastating indictment\" of our national values when neither political party supports federal protections for preborn children \"targeted for death by the abortion industry.\"\n\nRose cited the North Star, a plan supported by various pro-life groups that calls for equal protection for all under the 14th Amendment. The Live Action founder also emphasized that the 2024 platform would be the first time in decades the GOP platform did not include language calling for national abortion restrictions.\n\n\"While the new language is correct that the '14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process,' it is wrong when it says that the 'power' to decide life or death 'has been given to the states and to a vote of the people,'\" Rose added. \"When states discriminate against preborn children by denying the equal protection of their laws against homicide, they act unconstitutionally.\"\n\nAs Trump campaigns on the promise that he will not sign a national abortion ban, several prominent Republican lawmakers appear to have also adopted a more subtle stance on abortion.\n\nHere are three Republicans who have adopted a softer position on abortion:", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned prior precedent declaring abortion as a constitutional right.\n\nTrump later lashed out at critics of that position on social media, including Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, who had demanded GOP federal candidates embrace a federal minimum 15-week abortion limit and warned the organization \"will oppose any presidential candidate who refuses to embrace at a minimum a 15-week national standard to stop painful late-term abortions while allowing states to enact further protections.\" According to national health statistics, that proposed ban -- without taking into account exceptions -- would have affected approximately 6% of abortions in the U.S. while leaving the overwhelming majority of abortions legally protected. Nearly nine out of 10 abortions take place within the first trimester.\n\nThe text of the new GOP platform, released July 8 by the Trump campaign, states that Republicans will \"protect and defend a vote of the people, from within the states, on the issue of life.\" The document stated the party believes the 14th Amendment \"guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.\"\n\n\"After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People,\" it added. \"We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nThe party's previous platform -- last updated in 2016 -- included a call for a 20-week federal abortion ban that was removed from Trump's version. That proposed national ban would have affected little more than 1% of all abortions in the U.S.\n\nIn a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump argued, \"We are, quite simply, the Party of Common Sense!\"\n\nPro-life activists previously sent a letter asking RNC delegates \"to support pro-life planks and vote down any platform that weakens the party's commitment to the cause of life.\"\n\nSignatories on the letter included Dannenfelser, who had warned in a July 2 statement, \"If the Trump campaign decides to remove national protections for the unborn in the GOP platform, it would be a miscalculation that would hurt party unity and destroy pro-life enthusiasm between now and the election.\"\n\nHowever, in a July 8 statement, Dannenfelser asserted that under the new platform, \"The Republican Party remains strongly pro-life at the national level.\"\n\n\"It is important that the GOP reaffirmed its commitment to protect unborn life today through the 14th Amendment,\" she said. \"Under this amendment, it is Congress that enacts and enforces its provisions.\"\n\nDannenfelser, whose group works to elect pro-life candidates to public office, argued the new platform \"allows us to provide the winning message to 10 million voters, with four million visits at the door in key battleground states.\" She said the \"mission of the pro-life movement, for the next six months, must be to defeat the Biden-Harris extreme abortion agenda.\"\n\nBut former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump's former running mate -- who later broke with the former president over his unfounded claims of a stolen election and actions surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot -- called the platform change a \"profound disappointment to the millions of pro-life Republicans that have always looked to the Republican Party to stand for life.\"\n\n\"Now is not the time to surrender any ground in the fight for the right to life,\" Pence said in a statement. \"The 2024 platform removed historic pro-life principles that have long been the foundation of the platform. I urge delegates attending next week's Republican Convention to restore language to our party's platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.\"\n\nPence argued the new platform \"also cedes this fight to the states, leaving the unborn in California and Illinois to the far-left's extremist abortion policies.\"\n\n\"The right to life is not only a state issue; it is a moral issue, and our party must continue to speak with moral clarity and compassion about advancing the cause of life at the federal, state and local level,\" he said.\n\nPence argued the Dobbs decision \"did not return the question of abortion to the states only but to the elected representatives of the people.\"\n\n\"Every life, born and unborn, is precious and deserving of their rights endowed by their Creator. The 14th amendment, though rightly cited, will not protect the unborn across the country without further federal action,\" Pence said.\n\nHe argued the platform \"is part of a broader retreat in our party, trying to remain vague for political expedience.\"\n\n\"The GOP platform may be retreating, but we in the pro-life movement never will,\" Pence said.\n\nOn several occasions, Trump has blamed the issue of abortion and pro-life voters for the Republican Party's underperformance in the 2022 midterm election cycle. Analysts, by contrast, blamed in part quality issues with Republican campaigns in that cycle and Trump's repeated, unproven claims of a stolen 2020 election for the party's underperformance.\n\nHowever, several states have enacted abortion protections as the result of ballot measures since Dobbs: voters in Ohio, California, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Vermont and Kansas either rejected new limitations on abortion or expanded legal protections for it. But abortion itself will be on the ballot again in several states in November, including Florida, Nevada and likely Arizona, where closely-watched races for the U.S. Senate are also taking place.- - - Kate Scanlon is a national reporter for OSV News covering Washington.

The platform, however, still needs to be approved by the full Republican National Convention, which is set to meet in Milwaukee between July 15 and 18.\n\nWhile loyalty to Trump has become a defining characteristic of Republican politics in recent years, there are a few changes to Trump's new platform that could spark a fight at the convention.\n\nThe most high-profile of these changes is the party's stance on abortion. Previous Republican platforms have called for a national ban on abortions after 20 weeks beyond conception. The new proposed platform does not.\n\n\"We proudly stand for families and Life,\" the proposed platform reads. \"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People.\"\n\nThe removal of strict anti-abortion rights language looks to be a political move by Trump, as abortion politics have punished Republicans in elections since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nIt's also an issue where anti-abortion rights advocates are squarely in the minority, with 36 percent of Americans saying they think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, compared to 63 percent who say it should be legal, according to Pew Research.\n\nVice President Pence is the most prominent Republican so far to air grievances over the removal of anti-abortion rights language, saying Tuesday that the \"RNC platform is a profound disappointment to the millions of pro-life Republicans that have always looked to the Republican Party to stand for life.\"\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not return the question of abortion to the states only but to the elected representatives of the people,\" Mr. Pence said. \"The 14th amendment, though rightly cited, will not protect the unborn across the country without further federal action.\"\n\nSome anti-abortion rights activists, like evangelical leader Tony Perkins, have indicated that their ability to influence the proposed platform was squashed in the behind-closed-doors meeting where it was voted on, and have suggested that they will push the party to change its purported position.\n\n\"The 2024 platform is a concise statement of campaign priorities, but not a declaration of enduring principles for a political party,\" Mr. Perkins said in a statement.\n\nHe and other conservative Christian activists had sent a letter to Trump protesting the new language, asking him to support \"a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to children before birth.\"\n\nMr. Perkins has indicated that he and other dissatisfied religious conservatives are working on a minority report, which will reflect where they think the party's position should be on abortion.\n\nThe proposed platform also says that the GOP will support IVF treatments, birth control, and prenatal care, though some powerful conservative and Christian groups, like the Southern Baptists, have come out against IVF treatments just this year.\n\nTrump himself also acted to limit access to birth control at the behest of Christian groups like My Faith Votes, which was co-founded by his Housing and Urban Development secretary, Ben Carson, by rolling back a requirement that employers cover birth control in their insurance offerings.\n\nWhile Trump's apparent split with the religious right is the marquee issue that could lead to infighting at the Republican convention, there are other areas of the platform that could spark division, such as Trump's promises to preserve Social Security and Medicare.\n\nFor instance, the new platform promises to \"FIGHT FOR AND PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WITH NO CUTS, INCLUDING NO CHANGES TO THE RETIREMENT AGE.\"\n\nHowever, the outgoing GOP platform states that Republicans rejected that the topic was politically \"deadly for anyone who would change it.\"\n\nThe old platform promised benefits for current retirees and \"those close to retirement,\" and also said the system belonged to \"an old industrial era beyond the memory of most Americans,\" while making allusions to using the \"power of markets\" to reform Social Security.\n\nOn Medicare, the new platform also promises that there will be no cuts while the old platform proposed setting \"a more realistic age for eligibility in light of today's longer life span.\"\n\nSenator Scott of Florida is probably the leading Republican who has recently voiced opposition to preserving Social Security and Medicare benefits, releasing last year a plan to cut both programs -- a plan he was disciplined for releasing by Senator McConnell.\n\nThe RNC also omitted any mention of gun rights or same-sex marriage from the platform, two issues that have rallied Republicans in the past.\n\nThe proposed platform makes no mention of guns or gun rights, while the old platform supported so-called constitutional carry laws, which allow for carrying a concealed handgun without a permit, and opposed gun control regulations.\n\nThe old Republican platform also cited marriage between \"one man and one woman\" as the \"foundation for a free society,\" and said that the Supreme Court \"robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage\"when it legalized same-sex marriage.", "source": {"uri":

While ambitious, it applies to both the state and federal governments. The proposed ban on late-term abortion also requires federal and state action. This is a staunchly pro-life position, and we are grateful to President Trump and the Republican Party for standing up for life.\"\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley and Co-Chair Lara Trump focused on the economy and the border in their platform statements.\n\n\"Only President Trump can restore our economy, restore our southern border, and restore America's standing in the world,\" the two RNC leaders said in a joint statement. \"His 2024 Republican Party platform is a bold roadmap that will repair the devastating damage Joe Biden's far-left policies have done to this country, propel President Trump to a historic victory in November, and make America great again.\"\n\nThe platform is called \"Republican Platform 2024: Make America Great Again!\" It clearly bears the former president's influence, with a focus on strengthening border security and combating \"the epidemic of migrant crime.\" The platform includes the goal of conducting \"the largest deportation operation in American history.\"\n\nThe platform also proposes to build a \"large Iron Dome-type anti-missile shield across our entire country.\"\n\nTrump and his campaign have also embraced a new proposal in recent months: eliminating the tip tax. Trump has spoken about it frequently at rallies and it appears in the 2024 RNC platform, along with a promise to end inflation, which has been falling.\n\nThe Republican Party also states in its platform that there will be no cuts to Social Security or Medicare, and no change to the retirement age. It also says that the promotion of electric vehicles should be rolled back and regulations should be reduced. It also calls for \"same-day voting, voter ID, paper ballots, and proof of citizenship\" as a way to \"secure our elections.\"\n\nKathryn Watson is a political reporter for CBS News Digital, based in

Still, seeing a new Republican platform that leaves out language on banning abortion and makes no mention of pursuing personhood for embryos or fetuses has alarmed those attached to the party by a conservative Biblical anchor.\n\n\"First and foremost, they need to be as loyal to this issue of ending abortion as they are to other issues,\" Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life Action, told USA TODAY in an interview Monday.\n\n\"Do not relegate the pro-life movement to the kiddie table,\" she added. \"That's not going to fly.\"\n\nLila Rose, founder and president of the anti-abortion group Live Action, said the new Republican platform wording represents a \"downgrade.\" But beyond that it has created an awareness about Trump, who she said is \"throwing the pro-life movement under the bus.\"\n\n\"The people in trenches are unhappy with it,\" Rose said. \"They don't want compromise.\n\nBoth women were among seven anti-abortion activists who warned RNC delegates in a July 1 letter about rumors that anti-abortion Republicans were being locked out of the decision-making process.\n\nWhile the draft document won't be finalized until it is adopted by the full convention next week, its introduction comes at a critical time in the 2024 campaign and the country's larger reproductive rights debate.\n\nDemocrats are energized and have launched an aggressive campaign to put abortion on the ballot in several states this year in response to the strict prohibitions triggered by the Supreme Court's monumental decision two years ago overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nRepublicans remain divided on what to do next, however, as Trump and his more populist-leaning MAGA allies emphasize state restrictions and certain exemptions over pursuing a federal prohibition, which a new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll shows 6 out of 10 Americans oppose.\n\nAs Republicans strut into their convention feeling confident about Trump's overall chances in November, the former president's return to power could be spoiled by an aggressive coalition to his right that is ready to elbow their agenda onto the RNC stage and beyond.\n\nThe risks of igniting an intra-party fight are plentiful, especially at a time when Republicans want to show the country a unified front in contrast to Democratic infighting over President Joe Biden's age and fitness.\n\nBut many grassroots advocates say there is no better time or subject to press Trump on other than underscoring the importance of eliminating abortion completely.\n\n\"For decades, passionate pro-life activists have been the grassroots backbone of the Republican Party,\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement.\n\n\"They believed the Republican Party had an ironclad commitment to protect the unborn. This alliance is at risk of being severely weakened next week in Milwaukee.\"\n\nGOP 'lied and watered down' platform\n\nThe new platform credits Trump for the high court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, but also reflects his concern that this issue is a political loser with general election voters.\n\n\"After 51 years, because of us, that power (over abortion) has been given to the states and to a vote of the people,\" the proposed platform says. \"We will oppose late term abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nThe former president's campaign received a heavy dose of skepticism from allies leading up to the convention, especially over the secretive nature of the platform committee's drafting process, which barred the press and public.\n\nJohn Shelton, an analyst with Advancing American Freedom, a conservative policy group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence, said Monday that party officials had explicitly told the group how the platform wouldn't be changed.\n\n\"Guess what? They lied and watered down the platform on abortion, marriage, and IVF,\" Shelton said in a July 8 post on X.\n\nThose who attended the platform meetings confirmed with the USA TODAY Network that GOP officials had squashed debate on the abortion item.\n\nGail Ruzicka, an RNC platform committee member from Utah who has attended the convention since 1992, didn't vote for the platform because of the absence of such language.\n\n\"The platform simply says that we oppose late term abortion. Well, what about before that? Never happened before,\" she said. \"I've never been treated so badly - to have them force this vote on us before we even had a chance to read the platform.\"\n\nAsked a series of questions about how the platform came to be, including if Trump worries it might dampen the mood among evangelicals, the former president's campaign dodged answering directly.\n\n\"President Trump has long been consistent in supporting the rights of states to make decisions on abortion,\" Trump campaign spokeswoman Kaorile Leavitt told USA TODAY in a statement.\n\nBiden and the Democrats are the ones \"radically out of touch with the majority of Americans in their support for abortion\" without limitations, she said.\n\nThat's a much different tone compared to how Trump laid into social conservatives -- namely Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. -- in April for objecting to his stance that the abortion debate remain at the state level.\n\nTrump said the people who are unrelenting on leaving the issue up to the states, are \"handing Democrats their dream of the House, Senate, and perhaps even the presidency.\"\n\nActivists encouraged to 'speak boldly' at RNC\n\nWhen Trump carried the Republican banner in 2016 and again in his failed 2020 reelection bid, anti-abortion activists point out that the party didn't shy away from its social conservative roots and must not do so now.\n\n\"It is very concerning to see how the GOP is approaching this platform,\" Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said in a July 6 post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nPerkins said ahead of Monday's draft that Republicans shouldn't decorate the party platform with \"passive pastels\" at the risk of turning off the base.\n\nThe Family Research Council released a survey this month showing 66% of Republican voters think the party should either maintain or adopt stronger language opposing abortion.\n\nJust 19% of GOP respondents said the party should talk less about the issue, according to the poll.\n\nFor those who have held reservations about Trump's relationship with evangelical voters, the draft represents an act of political expediency at best. At worst, it comes off as a betrayal.\n\n\"There's certainly some loyalty to President Trump for what he's done, but he's now stabbing the pro-life movement in the back with these compromises,\" Rose told USA TODAY.\n\n\"It stems from this weird excuse that basically says if there's any loss that Republicans suffer, it's the pro lifers fault. It's absurd. It's wrong.\"\n\nThe Rev. Clint Pressley, a North Carolina megachurch pastor who was elected president of the Southern Baptist Convention in June, said Tuesday his members believe in the \"sanctity of all human life from conception to natural death.\"\n\nThey will insist elected officials do the same, he said.\n\n\"I am disheartened by what's happened in the GOP,\" Pressley said in a July 9 post on X. \"The GOP platform may be subject to change, but God's word is not.\"\n\nActivists who spoke with USA TODAY say this split will animate rank-and-file conservatives attending the July convention.\n\nMany are planing various \"Make Trump Pro-Life Again\" actions to draw out the former president and his team, such as bombarding convention-goers with digital billboards circling the event, handing out baby items as a show of solidarity and forming a prayer circle around a nearby Planned Parenthood.\n\nMatthew Hadro, a spokesman with Human Coalition Action, an anti-abortion group, said they plan to urge RNC delegates to \"stay vigilant\" at any attempts to further dilute the platform, and \"continue speaking boldly in defense of the unborn and their mothers.\"\n\nBut those who attend the convention must also help expand the political conversation to other pro-family policies, he said, such as expansion of the child tax credit; federal paid family leave; more resources for childcare; and strengthening programs such as Medicaid for postpartum care.\n\n\"A party that has professed to be pro-life in the past has to be unambiguous in its support for the cause, and give voters a compelling reason to show up at the polls,\" Hadro said.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lila_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lila Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristan_Hawkins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristan Hawkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culture war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moral Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

But much of Trump's policy agenda is deeply unpopular -- particularly with swing voters. There is little support for enacting tax cuts for corporations, repealing Obamacare, or rolling back environmental protections.\n\nThis is why Trump is attempting to distance himself from Project 2025, the radical blueprint for a second Trump administration. The 920-page document was written by his allies, more than 80% of whom worked in his administration. But Trump claims he has \"nothing to do\" with the people who wrote it because he does not want to be associated with unpopular policies. For Trump, the less people know about his plans for a second term, the better.\n\nThis is particularly true on the issue of abortion. Trump gladly takes credit for the repeal of Roe, which was made possible through Trump's nomination of three anti-abortion Supreme Court Justices. The repeal of Roe has cleared the way for many states to enforce draconian abortion bans. But, for the leaders of the Republican Party, repealing Roe was only the first step. The ultimate goal is a federal abortion ban. This goal was included in the Republican Party platform in 2016, which was ratified again in 2020. Specifically, the platform said that abortion was prohibited by the Constitution's 14th Amendment and called for legislation and a Constitutional amendment to make that \"clear.\"\n\nThe Constitution's guarantee that no one can \"be deprived of life, liberty or property\" deliberately echoes the Declaration of Independence's proclamation that \"all\" are \"endowed by their Creator\" with the inalienable right to life. Accordingly, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to children before birth.\n\nThis is a very unpopular position. Currently, 80% of Americans -- including 66% of Republicans -- oppose a national abortion ban.\n\nThe Trump campaign strategy for the 2024 GOP platform is to say much less about everything, including abortion. The previous GOP platform was 66 pages. The new GOP platform is 16 pages.\n\nThe 2024 GOP platform continues to assert that fetuses are protected by the 14th Amendment. But it drops the explicit call for federal legislation and a Constitutional amendment.\n\nWe proudly stand for families and Life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People.\n\nThe new language sounds slightly different and emphasizes state action. This is consistent with Trump's strategy of avoiding answering questions about abortion by claiming the issue should be left to the states. It is written to be more palatable to swing voters. But, substantively, the policy is exactly the same. The platform says the 14th Amendment protects the unborn, a position that would require a complete abortion ban. This position, if adopted by judges appointed by Trump, could impose a national abortion ban without legislation or a Constitutional amendment.\n\nBut many media outlets fell for this sleight-of-hand and claimed that Republicans had moderated or \"softened\" their position on abortion.\n\nThe New York Times: \"Following Trump's Lead, Republicans Adopt Platform That Softens Stance on Abortion\"\n\nNBC: \"Trump pushes new GOP platform softening party's positions on abortion and same-sex marriage\"\n\nRoll Call: \"RNC softens platform stance on abortion\"\n\nHuffPost: \"New GOP Platform Strikes National Abortion Ban\"\n\nAP: \"Republicans move at Trump's behest to change how they will oppose abortion\"\n\nThese headlines are inaccurate. The truth is that the Republican Party's position on abortion has not changed. That's why anti-abortion groups who support a national abortion ban have embraced the new platform, citing its language on the 14th Amendment.\n\nOn July 2, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion group that aggressively advocates for a national abortion ban, released a letter warning Trump not \"to remove national protections for the unborn in the GOP platform\" and to continue its \"ironclad commitment to protect the unborn.\" On July 8, the group announced that the language included in the new platform meets its demands. \"It is important that the G.O.P. reaffirmed its commitment to protect unborn life today through the 14th Amendment,\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement. \"Under this amendment, it is Congress that enacts and enforces its provisions. The Republican Party remains strongly pro-life at the national level.\"\n\nRalph Reed, who leads another anti-abortion group, the Faith and Freedom Coalition, similarly embraced the new platform. \"The Republican Party platform makes clear the unborn child has a right to life that is protected by the Constitution under the due process clause of the 14th amendment,\" Reed said in a statement. He described the new platform language as \"unapologetically pro-life\" and emphasized that the new platform calls for \"federal as well as state action.\"\n\nThese statements are completely inconsistent with the notion that Trump \"softened\" the Republican position. But the media is allowing Trump to create two realities: one for swing voters and one for anti-abortion activists.", "source": {"uri": "popular.info", "dataType": "news", "title": "popular.info"}, "authors": [{"uri": "judd_legum@popular.info", "name": "Judd Legum", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

That vote is on the convention floor on Monday, July 15.\n\nIn his statement, Pence seemed to urge members to vote against the Trump-backed platform at that upcoming session.\n\n\"Now is not the time to surrender any ground in the fight for the right to life. The 2024 platform removed historic pro-life principles that have long been the foundation of the platform. I urge delegates attending next week's Republican Convention to restore language to our party's platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed,\" Pence said.\n\nPence's objection to the platform comes as Family Research Council President Tony Perkins, a member of the 2024 GOP platform committee who has been vocal in his opposition to having the Republican platform soften its language on abortion, submitted a minority report to the RNC on Monday following the adoption of the 2024 document.\n\nThe minority report, too, calls for the 2024 platform to restore its \"commitment to a human life amendment.\"\n\n\"That commitment to a human life amendment and a call for the Fourteenth Amendment's protection application to children before birth has been repeated in every platform since and, by this declaration of principle, we extend it now. In no season, under no rationale spurred by the exigencies of a political moment, can or should we abandon the high principles that have created and sustained this party, with God's grace, into a third century,\" according to the minority report.\n\n\"With heaviness of heart but fullness of optimism that the defense of life will inevitably prevail, we resubmit these ideals to our fellow Americans,\" the letter concludes.\n\nMORE: Trump campaign memo signals plans to reduce the national GOP platform\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley defended the committee's newly inked platform during a short gaggle with reporters Monday evening -- doubling down specifically on the abortion language.\n\n\"We have a very solid pro-life platform. We feel very, very solid about it. I think you can just look at the number of pro-life groups from across the country that have come in and said that they strongly support this platform,\" said Whatley, who dispelled any notions from some Republicans that the platform was too soft on the issue.\n\n\"The Republican Party stands for life. And we are always going to stand for life. I think when you look at this platform, you're going to see that it is very pro-America. It is very pro-family. It is very pro-life. And we feel very strong about the language that we have.\"\n\nWhatley told ABC News he anticipates little objection and a backing of the platform when full membership votes on the language next week.\n\n\"This is the embodiment of what President Trump wants to run on. And this is the path. This is the platform that is going to help us,\" Whatley said. \"It provides a roadmap to make sure that we're going to get the government turned around, get America turned around and restore our leadership.\"\n\nPence, anti-abortion Republicans denounce Trump-backed RNC platform originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabella_murray@aol.com", "name": "Isabella Murray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 Republican Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Perkins_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Perkins (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Research_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family Research Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_values", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family values"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Software", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zRIYbaWnYvsBDw_wLP2cRw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_abc_news_articles_665/ad9ba242f48ed1617183ee9199148b1c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716769", "eventUri": "eng-9716769", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 1685, "textEnd": 1692}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Bailey, USA TODAY\n\nJuly 9, 2024 at 8:32 PM\n\nAs Republicans flock to Milwaukee for their 2024 convention, evangelicals and other social conservatives are jittery about their waning influence, and could end up spoiling Donald Trump's bash.\n\nThat's because for the first time in four decades - since the GOP agenda aligned with the so-called \"Moral Majority\" - the party's commitment to opposing abortion in its national platform just got slimmed down.\n\nTrump and the larger Make America Great Again movement remain muscular on other topics that motivate conservatives on immigration, crime and culture war items. But in falling short on abortion in the eyes of right-leaning voters of faith, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee risks creating a chasm with evangelical Christians who are essential to his electoral success and who've long had an uneasy relationship with his character.\n\nTrump's judicial appointments silenced most of those apprehensions when the now-former president ushered in a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Still, seeing a new Republican platform that leaves out language on banning abortion and makes no mention of pursuing personhood for embryos or fetuses has alarmed those attached to the party by a conservative Biblical anchor.\n\n\"First and foremost, they need to be as loyal to this issue of ending abortion as they are to other issues,\" Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life Action, told USA TODAY in an interview Monday.\n\n\"Do not relegate the pro-life movement to the kiddie table,\" she added. \"That's not going to fly.\"\n\nLila Rose, founder and president of the anti-abortion group Live Action, said the new Republican platform wording represents a \"downgrade.\" But beyond that it has created an awareness about Trump, who she said is \"throwing the pro-life movement under the bus.\"\n\n\"The people in trenches are unhappy with it,\" Rose said. \"They don't want compromise.\n\nBoth women were among seven anti-abortion activists who warned RNC delegates in a July 1 letter about rumors that anti-abortion Republicans were being locked out of the decision-making process.\n\nWhile the draft document won't be finalized until it is adopted by the full convention next week, its introduction comes at a critical time in the 2024 campaign and the country's larger reproductive rights debate.\n\nDemocrats are energized and have launched an aggressive campaign to put abortion on the ballot in several states this year in response to the strict prohibitions triggered by the Supreme Court's monumental decision two years ago overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nRepublicans remain divided on what to do next, however, as Trump and his more populist-leaning MAGA allies emphasize state restrictions and certain exemptions over pursuing a federal prohibition, which a new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll shows 6 out of 10 Americans oppose.\n\nAs Republicans strut into their convention feeling confident about Trump's overall chances in November, the former president's return to power could be spoiled by an aggressive coalition to his right that is ready to elbow their agenda onto the RNC stage and beyond.\n\nThe risks of igniting an intra-party fight are plentiful, especially at a time when Republicans want to show the country a unified front in contrast to Democratic infighting over President Joe Biden's age and fitness.\n\nBut many grassroots advocates say there is no better time or subject to press Trump on other than underscoring the importance of eliminating abortion completely.\n\n\"For decades, passionate pro-life activists have been the grassroots backbone of the Republican Party,\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement.\n\n\"They believed the Republican Party had an ironclad commitment to protect the unborn. This alliance is at risk of being severely weakened next week in Milwaukee.\"\n\nGOP 'lied and watered down' platform\n\nThe new platform credits Trump for the high court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, but also reflects his concern that this issue is a political loser with general election voters.\n\n\"After 51 years, because of us, that power (over abortion) has been given to the states and to a vote of the people,\" the proposed platform says. \"We will oppose late term abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nThe former president's campaign received a heavy dose of skepticism from allies leading up to the convention, especially over the secretive nature of the platform committee's drafting process, which barred the press and public.\n\nJohn Shelton, an analyst with Advancing American Freedom, a conservative policy group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence, said Monday that party officials had explicitly told the group how the platform wouldn't be changed.\n\n\"Guess what? They lied and watered down the platform on abortion, marriage, and IVF,\" Shelton said in a July 8 post on X.\n\nThose who attended the platform meetings confirmed with the USA TODAY Network that GOP officials had squashed debate on the abortion item.\n\nGail Ruzicka, an RNC platform committee member from Utah who has attended the convention since 1992, didn't vote for the platform because of the absence of such language.\n\n\"The platform simply says that we oppose late term abortion. Well, what about before that? Never happened before,\" she said. \"I've never been treated so badly - to have them force this vote on us before we even had a chance to read the platform.\"\n\nAsked a series of questions about how the platform came to be, including if Trump worries it might dampen the mood among evangelicals, the former president's campaign dodged answering directly.\n\n\"President Trump has long been consistent in supporting the rights of states to make decisions on abortion,\" Trump campaign spokeswoman Kaorile Leavitt told USA TODAY in a statement.\n\nBiden and the Democrats are the ones \"radically out of touch with the majority of Americans in their support for abortion\" without limitations, she said.\n\nThat's a much different tone compared to how Trump laid into social conservatives -- namely Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. -- in April for objecting to his stance that the abortion debate remain at the state level.\n\nTrump said the people who are unrelenting on leaving the issue up to the states, are \"handing Democrats their dream of the House, Senate, and perhaps even the presidency.\"\n\nActivists encouraged to 'speak boldly' at RNC\n\nWhen Trump carried the Republican banner in 2016 and again in his failed 2020 reelection bid, anti-abortion activists point out that the party didn't shy away from its social conservative roots and must not do so now.\n\n\"It is very concerning to see how the GOP is approaching this platform,\" Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said in a July 6 post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nPerkins said ahead of Monday's draft that Republicans shouldn't decorate the party platform with \"passive pastels\" at the risk of turning off the base.\n\nThe Family Research Council released a survey this month showing 66% of Republican voters think the party should either maintain or adopt stronger language opposing abortion.\n\nJust 19% of GOP respondents said the party should talk less about the issue, according to the poll.\n\nFor those who have held reservations about Trump's relationship with evangelical voters, the draft represents an act of political expediency at best. At worst, it comes off as a betrayal.\n\n\"There's certainly some loyalty to President Trump for what he's done, but he's now stabbing the pro-life movement in the back with these compromises,\" Rose told USA TODAY.\n\n\"It stems from this weird excuse that basically says if there's any loss that Republicans suffer, it's the pro lifers fault. It's absurd. It's wrong.\"\n\nThe Rev. Clint Pressley, a North Carolina megachurch pastor who was elected president of the Southern Baptist Convention in June, said Tuesday his members believe in the \"sanctity of all human life from conception to natural death.\"\n\nThey will insist elected officials do the same, he said.\n\n\"I am disheartened by what's happened in the GOP,\" Pressley said in a July 9 post on X. \"The GOP platform may be subject to change, but God's word is not.\"\n\nActivists who spoke with USA TODAY say this split will animate rank-and-file conservatives attending the July convention.\n\nMany are planing various \"Make Trump Pro-Life Again\" actions to draw out the former president and his team, such as bombarding convention-goers with digital billboards circling the event, handing out baby items as a show of solidarity and forming a prayer circle around a nearby Planned Parenthood.\n\nMatthew Hadro, a spokesman with Human Coalition Action, an anti-abortion group, said they plan to urge RNC delegates to \"stay vigilant\" at any attempts to further dilute the platform, and \"continue speaking boldly in defense of the unborn and their mothers.\"\n\nBut those who attend the convention must also help expand the political conversation to other pro-family policies, he said, such as expansion of the child tax credit; federal paid family leave; more resources for childcare; and strengthening programs such as Medicaid for postpartum care.\n\n\"A party that has professed to be pro-life in the past has to be unambiguous in its support for the cause, and give voters a compelling reason to show up at the polls,\" Hadro said.\n\n\"The platform is central to this effort.\"\n\nReporter Molly Black contributed to this story.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: RNC is approaching, antiabortion activists unhappy with platform", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phillip_m_bailey@aol.com", "name": "Phillip M.

The agenda drafted by Trump and his team was quickly and overwhelmingly adopted by the Republican convention's platform committee during a meeting Monday in Milwaukee.\n\nThe platform, which Trump's campaign described as \"pro-American\" and a \"stark contrast\" to President Joe Biden's record, prioritized immigration and the economy but made only one mention of abortion -- an issue that has proved to be a major GOP weakness in recent years.\n\nAbortion rights have appeared to be a winning issue for Democrats following the overturn of Roe v. Wade in June 2022, causing some Republicans -- including Trump -- to press the party to ease up on the topic ahead of the election.\n\nIn April, Trump made a video announcement advocating that abortion rights be left up to the states, who he said should decide the issue \"by vote or legislation.\"\n\nTrump's 2024 Republican platform reiterates the candidate's current stance.\n\n\"We proudly stand for families and Life,\" the platform reads. \"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.\"\n\nIt continues, \"After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People. We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nThe 2024 Republican National Convention to choose the party's president and vice presidential nominees for the November election is due to take place at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from July 15 to 18.\n\nThe platform has considerably less focus on abortion than Trump's platform in his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. His 2016 platform had a lengthy section on the issue, opposing the use of public funds to perform or promote abortion, supporting the appointment of anti-abortion judges and banning sex-selection abortions and abortions based on disabilities, among other things. It totaled more than 750 words. The 2024 platform includes only 90 words on abortion.\n\nIn an interview with Milwaukee's WISN12News, Gail Ruzicka, a platform committee member from Utah, was outraged after Monday's vote on the 2024 agenda.\n\n\"They rolled us. That's what they did.\" Ruzicka told the TV station. \"I've never seen this happen before. I don't understand why they did it, and I'm extremely disappointed that we do not have any pro-life language.\"\n\nNewsweek emailed the Trump campaign Tuesday morning for comment.\n\nIn a lengthy post on X, formerly Twitter, Jason Rapert, founder and president of the National Association of Christian Lawmakers, said the RNC's platform was the product of \"shortsighted and tone-deaf people.\"\n\nRapert also took aim at the platform removing language from the 2016 platform condemning the Supreme Court's 2015 decision to grant same-sex couples the right to marry. The 2024 platform does not weigh in on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\n\"The weakening of Life and Marriage statements in the RNC Platform Committee is a serious mistake. I have helped FIGHT tooth and nail to help elect Republicans in Arkansas and spoken in churches all over the country encouraging Christians to vote for Republicans BECAUSE they honored God and stood up strongly for Life and Traditional Marriage,\" Rapert wrote.\n\n\"Today, some shortsighted and tone-deaf people chose to abandon the bold platform language on Life and Marriage in the Republican Party Platform. This is a mistake that is already causing people to second guess their efforts in the upcoming election. It is shameful.\"\n\nTrump's former lawyer, Jenna Ellis, posted on X: \"You cannot be a faithful Christian and a faithful Republican after today. You cannot be loyal to two contradicting stances. For a long time, Christians have said it's impossible to be a faithful Christian and vote Democrat because of their policies.\n\n\"Well, choose ye this day whom you will serve. As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. I am not and will not be a member of the Republican Party under this platform.\"\n\nOther anti-abortion conservatives were also quick in rebuking the platform.\n\n\"The RNC no longer supports: A federal abortion ban; Marriage exclusively between one man and one woman. This is Christless Conservativism (sic),\" conservative media personality John Root said on X.\n\n\"The Republican Party's platform has been changed to now only opposing \"late term abortion.\" Evil and unacceptable!\" Texas pastor Tom Buck wrote on X.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabe_whisnant@newsweek.com", "name": "Gabe Whisnant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Wade in the CNN Presidential Debate.\n\nAs Republicans flock to Milwaukee for their 2024 convention, evangelicals and other social conservatives are jittery about their waning influence, and could end up spoiling Donald Trump's bash.\n\nThat's because for the first time in four decades - since the GOP agenda aligned with the so-called \"Moral Majority\" - the party's commitment to opposing abortion in its national platform just got slimmed down.\n\nTrump and the larger Make America Great Again movement remain muscular on other topics that motivate conservatives on immigration, crime and culture war items. But in falling short on abortion in the eyes of right-leaning voters of faith, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee risks creating a chasm with evangelical Christians who are essential to his electoral success and who've long had an uneasy relationship with his character.\n\nTrump's judicial appointments silenced most of those apprehensions when the now-former president ushered in a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Still, seeing a new Republican platform that leaves out language on banning abortion and makes no mention of pursuing personhood for embryos or fetuses has alarmed those attached to the party by a conservative Biblical anchor.\n\n\"First and foremost, they need to be as loyal to this issue of ending abortion as they are to other issues,\" Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life Action, told USA TODAY in an interview Monday.\n\n\"Do not relegate the pro-life movement to the kiddie table,\" she added. \"That's not going to fly.\"\n\nLila Rose, founder and president of the anti-abortion group Live Action, said the new Republican platform wording represents a \"downgrade.\" But beyond that it has created an awareness about Trump, who she said is \"throwing the pro-life movement under the bus.\"\n\n\"The people in trenches are unhappy with it,\" Rose said. \"They don't want compromise.\n\nBoth women were among seven anti-abortion activists who warned RNC delegates in a July 1 letter about rumors that anti-abortion Republicans were being locked out of the decision-making process.\n\nWhile the draft document won't be finalized until it is adopted by the full convention next week, its introduction comes at a critical time in the 2024 campaign and the country's larger reproductive rights debate.\n\nDemocrats are energized and have launched an aggressive campaign to put abortion on the ballot in several states this year in response to the strict prohibitions triggered by the Supreme Court's monumental decision two years ago overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nRepublicans remain divided on what to do next, however, as Trump and his more populist-leaning MAGA allies emphasize state restrictions and certain exemptions over pursuing a federal prohibition, which a new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll shows 6 out of 10 Americans oppose.\n\nAs Republicans strut into their convention feeling confident about Trump's overall chances in November, the former president's return to power could be spoiled by an aggressive coalition to his right that is ready to elbow their agenda onto the RNC stage and beyond.\n\nThe risks of igniting an intra-party fight are plentiful, especially at a time when Republicans want to show the country a unified front in contrast to Democratic infighting over President Joe Biden's age and fitness.\n\nBut many grassroots advocates say there is no better time or subject to press Trump on other than underscoring the importance of eliminating abortion completely.\n\n\"For decades, passionate pro-life activists have been the grassroots backbone of the Republican Party,\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement.\n\n\"They believed the Republican Party had an ironclad commitment to protect the unborn. This alliance is at risk of being severely weakened next week in Milwaukee.\"\n\nGOP 'lied and watered down' platform\n\nThe new platform credits Trump for the high court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, but also reflects his concern that this issue is a political loser with general election voters.\n\n\"After 51 years, because of us, that power (over abortion) has been given to the states and to a vote of the people,\" the proposed platform says. \"We will oppose late term abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nThe former president's campaign received a heavy dose of skepticism from allies leading up to the convention, especially over the secretive nature of the platform committee's drafting process, which barred the press and public.\n\nJohn Shelton, an analyst with Advancing American Freedom, a conservative policy group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence, said Monday that party officials had explicitly told the group how the platform wouldn't be changed.\n\n\"Guess what? They lied and watered down the platform on abortion, marriage, and IVF,\" Shelton said in a July 8 post on X.\n\nThose who attended the platform meetings confirmed with the USA TODAY Network that GOP officials had squashed debate on the abortion item.\n\nGail Ruzicka, an RNC platform committee member from Utah who has attended the convention since 1992, didn't vote for the platform because of the absence of such language.\n\n\"The platform simply says that we oppose late term abortion. Well, what about before that? Never happened before,\" she said. \"I've never been treated so badly - to have them force this vote on us before we even had a chance to read the platform.\"\n\nAsked a series of questions about how the platform came to be, including if Trump worries it might dampen the mood among evangelicals, the former president's campaign dodged answering directly.\n\n\"President Trump has long been consistent in supporting the rights of states to make decisions on abortion,\" Trump campaign spokeswoman Kaorile Leavitt told USA TODAY in a statement.\n\nBiden and the Democrats are the ones \"radically out of touch with the majority of Americans in their support for abortion\" without limitations, she said.\n\nThat's a much different tone compared to how Trump laid into social conservatives -- namely Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. -- in April for objecting to his stance that the abortion debate remain at the state level.\n\nTrump said the people who are unrelenting on leaving the issue up to the states, are \"handing Democrats their dream of the House, Senate, and perhaps even the presidency.\"\n\nActivists encouraged to 'speak boldly' at RNC\n\nWhen Trump carried the Republican banner in 2016 and again in his failed 2020 reelection bid, anti-abortion activists point out that the party didn't shy away from its social conservative roots and must not do so now.\n\n\"It is very concerning to see how the GOP is approaching this platform,\" Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said in a July 6 post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nPerkins said ahead of Monday's draft that Republicans shouldn't decorate the party platform with \"passive pastels\" at the risk of turning off the base.\n\nThe Family Research Council released a survey this month showing 66% of Republican voters think the party should either maintain or adopt stronger language opposing abortion.\n\nJust 19% of GOP respondents said the party should talk less about the issue, according to the poll.\n\nFor those who have held reservations about Trump's relationship with evangelical voters, the draft represents an act of political expediency at best. At worst, it comes off as a betrayal.\n\n\"There's certainly some loyalty to President Trump for what he's done, but he's now stabbing the pro-life movement in the back with these compromises,\" Rose told USA TODAY.\n\n\"It stems from this weird excuse that basically says if there's any loss that Republicans suffer, it's the pro lifers fault.

The convention comes as Trump continues to hold a lead in key swing states, while Democrats publicly question whether President Joe Biden, who won most delegates in the Democratic primary, should remain their nominee amid concerns about his age.\n\nDespite positive developments for the Trump campaign, he is still facing anger from many conservatives the week before the convention amid backlash over the Republican Party platform and speaker lineup at the convention.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's campaign for comment via email.\n\nSome conservatives have expressed outrage over the party's platform with regards to its language on abortion, set to be a potentially decisive issue in November.\n\nThe platform, which was drafted by Trump and his team, does not include calls for a federal abortion ban, instead saying the issue should be left to the states.\n\nThe position is largely in line with what Trump has said publicly as abortion has become a sore spot from Republicans, who faced electoral losses after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the case that for decades guaranteed abortion rights nationwide, in 2022.\n\nBut the omission sparked backlash from conservatives who more strongly oppose reproductive rights.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence wrote in a post to X, formerly Twitter: \"The RNC platform is a profound disappointment to the millions of pro-life Republicans that have always looked to the Republican Party to stand for life.\"\n\n\"Now is not the time to surrender any ground in the fight for the right to life.

I urge delegates attending next week's Republican Convention to restore language to our party's platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed,\" Pence wrote.\n\nGayle Ruzicka, a platform committee member from Utah, told Milwaukee's WISN12News that the campaign \"rolled us.\"\n\n\"I've never seen this happen before. I don't understand why they did it, and I'm extremely disappointed that we do not have any pro-life language,\" she said.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley defended the platform in remarks to reporters Monday night.\n\n\"We have a very solid pro-life platform. We feel very, very solid about it. I think you can just look at the number of pro-life groups from across the country that have come in and said that they strongly support this platform,\" he said.\n\nElsewhere, the conservative organization Advancing American Freedom on Tuesday released a memo titled \"Calling Balls and Strikes on the RNC Platform,\" warning that it \"retreats on life and global leadership, while neglecting to flesh out the Republican Party's position on a number of issues.\"\n\nThe group took issue with the platform supporting tariffs, not having a \"clear plan\" to address China and not sufficiently addressing Ukraine or Taiwan.\n\nIn addition to taking issue with the platform's abortion stance, the group also raised concerns about some domestic policies including not addressing TikTok, rejecting reforms for Social Security and Medicare and its language around same-sex marriage.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, raised concerns about the process for adopting the platform. He wrote in a statement that delegates were \"only given a few minutes of discussion\" before debate on the platform was ended and a vote was taken.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the choreographed process -- which allowed no amendments to be discussed or voted upon -- was unbecoming of a party that champions free speech and due process,\" he wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, other conservatives have criticized the RNC's speaker lineup, particularly after celebrity personality Amber Rose was confirmed as a speaker.\n\n\"Now, under the total Trump takeover of the RNC, the GOP will be represented at the convention by Amber Rose who believes in 'empowering the LGBTQ+ community', 'ending sexual, social injustice, derogatory labeling, and gender inequality'.\"\n\nCongressional candidate Dr. Maria Peiro then challenged Trump supporters, asking: \"Conservatives who voted for Trump in the primary, how do you like being represented by a woke, pro-trans, socialist at the GOP convention?\"\n\nOthers noted that high-profile Republicans who challenged Trump for the nomination, like former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, are absent from the convention.\n\n\"George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, Liz Cheney, Nikki Haley, and Ron DeSantis weren't invited to speak at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. But no worries.

It is meant to outline the party's policy goals for the coming years.\n\nWhile previous versions of the document said that unborn children have a \"fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed\" and called for a constitutional amendment to guarantee that right, this year's platform uses much more moderate language and emphasizes the role of states in protecting life.\n\nIt reads: \"We proudly stand for families and life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process, and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights.\"\n\nThe platform goes on to laud the overturn of Roe v. Wade and then express support for prenatal care, birth control, and in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n\"After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the states and to a vote of the people. We will oppose late-term abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF,\" the new document reads.\n\nThe draft, which according to the Washington Post was approved in an 84-18 vote, was written by former President Donald Trump's campaign and adopted at his urging.\n\nThe Trump campaign celebrated the platform's passage in a Monday statement in which they said it \"articulates his [Trump's] vision to Make America Great Again in a way that is concise and digestible for every voter.\"\n\nSince April, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee has consistently signaled his desire to keep abortion exclusively a state issue. During a televised debate last month with President Joe Biden, he asserted that the 2021 Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court decision that reversed Roe v. Wade means that abortion is now up to the states.\n\nLeading pro-life Republicans have echoed this sentiment, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio saying in a Sunday CNN interview that \"our platform has to reflect our nominee and our nominee's position actually happens to be one grounded in reality ... His position on this has been the reality that you can't pass a federal law [protecting unborn life] even if we wanted to.\"\n\nThe reaction from the pro-life community, meanwhile, was mixed.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, praised the platform, saying it demonstrates that the Republican Party \"remains strongly pro-life at the national level.\"\n\nKristi Hamrick, a representative for Students for Life Action, told CNA that while \"not perfect\" the platform represents \"two very big wins\" for the pro-life movement: acknowledging that the 14th Amendment protects all life, including unborn life, and condemning late-term abortion.\n\nHamrick said that she has been working with the Trump campaign and delegates to the Republican National Convention to stress the importance of the Republican Party prioritizing the protection of unborn life.\n\nEven with a reduced legislative focus, Hamrick said there is a lot of important work a future Trump administration could do for the pro-life movement including reversing \"a lot of weaponized federal policy\" that she said is \"prejudiced in favor of abortion.\"\n\n\"If we detangled and cut out the cancer of abortion and abortion-related programming from our federal budgets, we can have a healthier budget and a life-affirming budget.\" If Republicans were to achieve those wins under a Trump administration, Hamrick said it would constitute \"a very vibrant and vigorous term.\"", "source": {"uri": "ncregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Catholic Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_pinedo@ncregister.com", "name": "Peter Pinedo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prenatal care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The convention comes as Trump continues to hold a lead in key battleground states, while Democrats are publicly debating whether President Joe Biden, who won the most delegates in the Democratic primary, should remain their nominee due to concerns about his age.\n\nDespite the positive developments for Trump's campaign, he still faces the wrath of many conservatives in the week leading up to the convention, amid backlash over the Republican Party's platform and the list of speakers at the convention.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the Trump campaign via email for comment.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Chesapeake, Virginia, on June 28, 2024.

Trump is facing backlash from some Republicans ahead of the Republican National Convention next week. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images\n\nSome conservatives have expressed outrage at the party's platform over its language on abortion, which could be a defining issue in November.\n\nThe platform, written by Trump and his team, does not include calls for a federal ban on abortion, instead saying the issue should be left to the states.\n\nThat position is largely consistent with what Trump has said publicly as abortion has become a sore point for Republicans, who suffered electoral losses after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, which for decades guaranteed abortion rights nationwide.\n\nBut the omission sparked a backlash from conservatives who are more vocal in their opposition to reproductive rights.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter: \"The RNC platform is a profound disappointment to the millions of pro-life Republicans who have always counted on the Republican Party to stand up for life.\"\n\n\"This is not the time to give up ground in the fight for the right to life. The 2024 platform has removed historic pro-life principles that have long been the foundation of the platform. I urge delegates attending next week's Republican convention to restore to our party platform language recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life that cannot be violated,\" Pence wrote.\n\nUtah platform committee member Gayle Ruzicka told Milwaukee's WISN12News that the campaign \"knocked us out.\"\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this happen before. I don't understand why they did this, and I'm extremely disappointed that we don't have any pro-life speeches,\" she said.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley defended the platform in remarks to reporters Monday night.\n\n\"We have a very strong pro-life platform. We are confident in its strength. I think you only have to look at the number of pro-life groups from across the country that have come to us and said they strongly support that platform,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, the conservative organization Advancing American Freedom released a memo Tuesday titled \"Call to Strike the RNC Platform,\" warning that the RNC \"is backsliding on life and global leadership while failing to flesh out the Republican Party's position on a number of issues.\"\n\nThe group criticized the platform for supporting tariffs, not having a \"clear plan\" to address China's needs and not addressing Ukraine or Taiwan enough.\n\nIn addition to challenging the platform's stance on abortion, the group also raised concerns about certain national policies, including its failure to address TikTok, its rejection of Social Security and Medicare reforms and its language around same-sex marriage.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, expressed concerns about the process for adopting the platform. He wrote in a statement that delegates had \"only a few minutes of discussion\" before debate on the platform was closed and a vote was held.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the choreographed process - which did not allow for discussion or voting on any amendments - was unworthy of a party that defends free speech and due process,\" he wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, other conservatives have criticized the RNC's speaker lineup, particularly after celebrity Amber Rose was confirmed as a speaker.\n\n\"Now, with Trump's full takeover of the RNC, the GOP will be represented at the convention by Amber Rose, who believes in \"empowering the LGBTQ+ community,\" and \"ending sexual and social injustice, derogatory labeling, and gender inequality.\"\n\nCongressional candidate Dr. Maria Peiro then challenged Trump supporters by asking: \"Conservatives who voted for Trump in the primaries, how do you like being represented by a woke, pro-trans socialist at the GOP convention?\"\n\nOthers noted that prominent Republicans who challenged Trump for the nomination, such as former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are absent from the convention.\n\n\"George W.

Wade.\n\nCarol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, praised the platform committee for its \"hard work ensuring that the party's goal of protecting women and their preborn children is clearly stated.\"\n\nShe also said, \"In contrast to what the Democratic Party offers to women and their preborn children, the Republican Party platform offers life and hope.\"\n\nThe section on abortion, near the end of the platform, states: \"We proudly stand for families and life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process, and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights.\"\n\nIt also praises the overturn of Roe v. Wade and then states support for \"policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF.\"\n\nThe draft, written by former President Donald Trump's campaign, was approved in an 84-18 vote.\n\nIt also briefly mentions marriage, saying the party no longer defines it as between \"one man and one woman.\"\n\nThe document's abortion shift differed from previous versions of the party's platform that had stressed that unborn children have a \"fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed\" and called for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing that right.\n\nBut Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said the new platform demonstrates that the Republican Party \"remains strongly pro-life at the national level.\"\n\n\"It is important that the GOP reaffirmed its commitment to protect unborn life today through the 14th Amendment,\" she added in a statement.\n\nAnd Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins said on X, formerly Twitter, that \"it is a win that the GOP platform did not back a weak federal abortion limit that would allow for 9/10 abortions to continue. Their support of 14th amendment protections for preborn children is an open door to passing strong pro-life federal legislation.\"\n\nWhile many pro-life advocates have accepted the shift, not all are in agreement.\n\nSome expressed concern, including Lila Rose, a Catholic convert and founder and president of Live Action, a pro-life group that conducts undercover investigative reports on Planned Parenthood and abortion facilities.\n\nOn X, she said: \"Trump's recent statements on life, and the downgraded GOP platform protections on life he's approved, are alienating some of his most passionate supporters and will win exactly zero fence sitters.\"\n\nBrian Burch, president of Catholic Vote, a conservative, nonprofit political advocacy group, said he is \"sympathetic to those who have fought for decades to preserve the robust pro-life language that has been part of the platform for decades.\"\n\nHowever, he also said on the group's website that the new platform's language is \"unmistakably pro-life.\"\n\n\"It's not the language we would have drafted,\" he said, \"but it provides plenty of room to continue to move the country in a pro-life direction.\"\n\nGail Ruzicka, an RNC platform committee member from Utah, did not see this nuance. She told an ABC affiliate just after the committee's vote that she has \"never seen this happen before. I don't understand why they did it, and I'm extremely disappointed that we do not have any pro-life language.\"", "source": {"uri": "thetablet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tablet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carol_zimmermann@thetablet.org", "name": "Carol Zimmermann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Quite simply, they did everything in their power to destroy our Country,\" added the preamble.\n\nNoting that Trump's first term marked a positive break in this trend, the platform indicates that a Republican trifecta in Washington, D.C., would continue his earlier project of making America great again. Doing so will apparently involve making good on the following 20 promises, originally in all caps:\n\nThe remainder of the platform elaborates on some of these promises while also committing the GOP to take other stands -- against the creation of a central bank digital currency; against \"Democrats' unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown\"; against taxpayer-funded sex change mutilations; for the development of artificial intelligence rooted in free speech; and for the restoration of beauty in public architecture and through conservation efforts.\n\nThe platform also indicates that Republicans will support the establishment of a federal task force aimed at fighting anti-Christian bias \"that will investigate all forms of illegal discrimination, harassment, and persecution against Christians in America.\"\n\nWhereas previous Republican platforms emphasized pro-life concerns regarding the slaughter of the unborn, Trump's platform reads like Republican realpolitik regarding abortion.\n\nWhile indicating that the 14th Amendment \"guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process,\" the platform intimates that its application to the unborn is a matter for individual states to decide. The Republican Party moving forward will apparently only commit to opposing late-term abortion while simultaneously supporting access to \"birth control\" and fertility treatments.\n\nThe Washington Post highlighted that the document also omits language from previous platforms condemning the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to grant homosexuals the right to \"marry.\"\n\nInstead, it states, \"Republicans will promote a culture that values the sanctity of marriage, the blessings of childhood, and the foundational role of families, and supports working parents. We will end policies that punish families.\"\n\nTrump noted on Truth Social, \"Ours is a forward-looking Agenda with strong promises that we will accomplish very quickly when we win the White House and Republican Majorities in the House and Senate. We are, quite simply, the Party of Common Sense!\"\n\nSenior Trump campaign advisors Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a joint statement, \"While Joe Biden and Democrats argue about who will be at the top of their ticket and have implemented policies that have raised prices on everyday families, opened the floodgates to migrant crime via wide-open borders, shackled American energy with red tape forced by Washington bureaucrats, and sewn [sic] chaos across the world through weak foreign policy, President Trump will Make America Great Again through these America First principles.\"\n\nThe 2024 platform has been met with mixed responses.\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), the chair of the platform committee, suggested it's the \"best platform we've ever put forward.\"\n\n\"I think we have a unified party behind President Trump who's our nominee and our platform reflects his views,\" Kevin Cabrera, an RNC platform committee member from Florida, told WISN-TV. \"It's a stark contrast to the other side.\"\n\nSome in the tech space celebrated the platform's resistance to regulation and forward-thinking on space and AI.\n\nJacob Helberg, commissioner for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, suggested it \"sets a new standard for what a pro-tech agenda looks like.\"\n\nGayle Ruzicka, a RNC platform committee member from Utah, told WISN there was no virtually no debate about the platform.\n\n\"There was no committees. We've always had subcommittees where we can go in and work on a section of the platform. We can propose amendments, debate them, add them. Always happens -- I've done it many times,\" said Ruzicka. \"They didn't allow any amendments. They didn't allow any discussion. They rolled us.\"\n\n\"I'm extremely disappointed that we do not have any pro-life language,\" added Ruzicka. \"There are good things in this platform. There are a lot of things in there that I support. ... But I didn't vote for this because we've never had a platform -- I've been coming to these conventions since 1992 and this is the first time we don't have a pro-life platform.\"\n\nWhile some pro-life advocates, such as Paul Brown, director of policy for Abolish Abortion Texas, similarly bemoaned the party's softened stance against abortion, others -- including Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, and Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project, have voiced support for the \"common-sense promises\" in the platform.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com",

If your favorite baseball team needs pitching help this season, we might suggest its front office sign Rep. J.D. Scholten of Iowa, who recently pitched a gem for the minor league Sioux City Explorers.\n\nThe Republican National Committee's platform committee approved a 16-page draft Monday that was shorter than previous editions and watered down the party's stance on abortion, prompting muted reactions from even some staunchly pro-life senators on Capitol Hill.\n\nEvery Republican Party platform since 1984 has affirmed that the unborn have an inalienable right to life and endorsed \"legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.\" But at next week's Republican National Convention, the first since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the party is set to approve a platform that sheds, at the direction of former President Donald Trump, the party's longstanding commitment to the unborn child's \"fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed\" in favor of ambiguous language that centered the issue on the states.\n\n\"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights,\" the 2024 platform reads. \"After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People.\" The platform also states the party opposes late-term abortion but supports access to birth control and in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments.\n\nSen. John Barrasso of Wyoming chaired the RNC's platform committee in 2016, when the party's platform endorsed both a federal restriction on abortion at the point at which an unborn baby can feel pain (effectively about 20 weeks into the pregnancy) and federal legislation to stop sex-selective abortion. The GOP did not adopt a platform in 2020. Barrasso, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, told Dispatch Politics Tuesday that he approves of the changes to the platform.\n\n\"I really support what they've done this time to shorten the entire platform, make it easier for people to read and go through -- and to reflect our candidate,\" Barrasso said. \"The platform reflects President Trump's candidacy, and I'm 100 percent supportive of him.\"\n\nIndeed, the new draft platform -- which will have to be approved by a vote of the full convention next week in Milwaukee -- has the stamp of the party's presumptive nominee. The committee approved the platform months after Trump cut a video expressing his belief that Republicans should leave the issue of abortion to the states in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health decision that overturned Roe, and said he would not sign a national abortion ban if Congress were to approve one.\n\nBut not all of Trump's allies said they approve of the platform committee's alterations to the abortion language. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said he shared the concerns of dismayed pro-life voters and decried the fact that the draft language neither articulated a clear policy nor included condemnations of fetal tissue harvesting and federal taxpayer funding for abortions.\n\n\"I can't say that I'm in favor of weakening the party's historic commitment to life,\" he told Dispatch Politics. \"I wouldn't compromise our stand on life at all. We ought to embrace the Dobbs decision, and the principle of Dobbs, of course, is that the voters ought to make this decision, not justices. That's absolutely right, so I think we should absolutely affirm that and, at the same time, say that, as the voters are making their decision, we want them to vote for life.\"\n\nHawley added that he was open to pro-life action at both the state and federal level. \"Where there is a national consensus that has formed, I think that you can find the votes for that in Congress. I think it's appropriate for Congress to act,\" he said.\n\nAnother pro-life Republican, Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, stopped short of a full-throated endorsement of the platform's language, but he spoke approvingly of its most appealing parts to pro-life Republicans.\n\n\"Obviously, we still retain the focus on life, which is extremely important,\" he told Dispatch Politics. \"We're the only party that really supports that, so I want to be able to keep that. President Trump's focus has been on states being more empowered, so it maintains the 14th Amendment, that section, in just a little different language for that. But we've got to continue to be able to speak up for the value of children.\"\n\nOther senators told Dispatch Politics they had not read the draft platform, among them Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a pro-choice moderate from Alaska. And Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana also said he had not read it but downplayed the importance of party platforms in general.\n\n\"I don't think anybody pays attention to platforms. I've never seen a platform influence a presidential election. I've never seen a platform influence the passage of a bill in the United States Congress,\" he said. \"I'm not saying that I don't appreciate everybody's hard work. You can't lose when you're having the free exchange of ideas, but I just don't think it matters as much.\"\n\nAs some elected Democrats call on President Joe Biden to end his reelection bid over fears he will damage the party's chances of winning competitive races this November, one of this election cycle's most vulnerable Democratic senators is offering mixed signals about the leader of his party.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown told Dispatch Politics today on Capitol Hill that he is listening to \"legitimate concerns\" of Ohio voters regarding Biden's age, but refused to comment further on whether the president should drop out. Brown's remarks come a day after he reportedly told fellow Senate Democrats behind closed doors at a Tuesday lunch that Biden could not win a second term, according to a report from CNN's Dana Bash.\n\nBrown's conflicting messages on Biden's potential departure from the race comes as the three-term senator faces a strong challenge from Republican Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland-based businessman who found success in auto sales, who is backed by former President Donald Trump. The Buckeye State's Senate race -- expected to be one of the closest and most expensive this year -- will be competitive even as Trump is anticipated to win Ohio handily.\n\nMoreno has attempted to capitalize on Biden's negative approval ratings and concerns about his age that have intensified following his disastrous debate performance June 27. Shortly before the debate, Moreno's campaign released an advertisement attacking Brown as a Biden ally who votes with the president \"99% of the time\" while taking digs at the politicians' advanced ages; Brown is 71.\n\nHowever, Republican attempts to link Brown to Biden may not be a dependable strategy, thanks to Brown's populist brand that has found broad support while distinguishing him from other Democrats. Because of Brown's popularity, Democrats may hold on to Ohio's Senate seat -- one that may decide the chamber's balance of power -- while Trump simultaneously walks to an easy victory.\n\n\"Senator Brown is a particularly competitive candidate,\" Greg Lawson, a research fellow at the Buckeye Institute, a conservative think tank in Columbus, told Dispatch Politics. \"He's a very well-known quantity in Ohio. ... He has longevity, strong ties with trade unions, and his own brand, which is very important in the state.\"\n\nBrown, the lone Democrat elected to statewide office in the increasingly red Ohio since 2011, has been a fixture in state politics since the 1970s, consistently conveying a progressive, populist message that has notable similarities with Trump on policy. Both politicians support economic protectionism -- criticizing trade with China while lamenting America's manufacturing decline -- and support measures to secure the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBrown's positions have found favor with working and middle-class voters across party lines, one of whom is Georgie Sundberg, a retiree from the Cleveland suburb of Burton. When she votes for Trump for the third time this November, she says she also will vote for Brown, as she has done since his first Senate run in 2006.\n\n\"[Brown] remembers the people here in Northeast Ohio,\" Sundberg told Dispatch Politics. \"He has the right positions on the border, fentanyl, and the military,\" issues she compares favorably to Trump's stances.\n\nPaul Beck, a political science professor at Ohio State University, told Dispatch Politics that voters like Sundberg are not an anomaly. \"Ohio voters are quite willing to differentiate between candidates they like and have voted for in the past, regardless of party,\" said Beck.\n\nSundberg's loyalty to Trump hasn't caused her to be persuaded to vote for Moreno. \"If there was another Republican [nominee] that had Trump's backing, then maybe I'd consider voting for them. Bernie Moreno is just not good enough.\"\n\nLack of enthusiasm for Moreno among some Ohioans showed in an early June Marist poll showing Brown leading Moreno by 5 percent among registered voters. In addition, the latest campaign finance reports ending in March show Brown with nearly $16 million cash on hand, while Moreno has slightly above $2 million.\n\nBrown's advantage may be in part due to his campaign's early media offensive, releasing several ads -- both positive and negative -- including one attacking Moreno as an untrustworthy auto salesman who will \"say anything\" to get elected.\n\nHowever, the Biden administration's own vulnerabilities, particularly on the economy, may provide a boost to Brown's challenger as the election draws nearer. \"No matter who's at the top of the ticket, an issue like inflation is going to be an anchor that could bring down Brown's support,\" Lawson of the Buckeye Institute told Dispatch Politics.\n\nLawson also suggested that Trump's support for Moreno will work to his advantage in driving Republican turnout, yet cautioned that while \"a Trump endorsement is influential, [it is] not decisive.\"\n\nAs Brown and other Democrats fret over whether Biden will harm Democratic victory prospects, Beck from Ohio State told Dispatch Politics that the Senate election will be competitive no matter who leads the party's ticket.\n\n\"It's going to be a tight race with or without Biden,\" Beck said.\n\nRead more at The Dispatch", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Ohio anti-abortion activists aren't happy", "body": "COLUMBUS, Ohio - Ohio Right to Life, the state's largest and most influential anti-abortion organization, is concerned about a new platform under consideration by Republicans across the country, its executive director said.\n\nThe proposed anti-abortion platform - which a committee adopted Monday afternoon, before it will be presented to the entire convention for a vote next week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee- says abortion is an issue to be decided by the states, a departure from calling for a national ban in the current platform, which has been in place for 40 years. The proposed platform also doesn't call for a constitutional amendment for fetal personhood, subbing it out for language that says states can pass fetal personhood rights laws under the 14th Amendment.\n\nThis language reflects a pivot some Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have made in the abortion rights debate, as independent and Republican voters have shown increased support for abortion rights, including in Ohio - which enshrined abortion rights in a constitutional amendment last November. The Trump campaign was involved in the development of the new proposed platform.\n\nAnd Ohio Right to Life is not alone. Other Ohio anti-abortion activists also have expressed worries about whether the new proposed platform goes too far.\n\nThe Center for Christian Virtue, a conservative Evangelical public policy organization is part of a coalition called the Platform Integrity Project, that plans to press delegates in Milwaukee to preserve the current \"strong pro-life, pro-family\" platform.\n\nState Rep. Gary Click, a Sandusky County Republican who is one of the legislature's most socially conservative members, has also spoken out against the proposed change.\n\nThree U.S. Supreme Court justices Trump appointed voted to end Roe v. Wade two years ago, although Trump has tried to back away from a federal ban, now saying abortion rights should be an issue left to the states.\n\nREAD MORE: Ohio has abortion rights in the constitution. Yet as abortions are on the rise, hospitals have not increased services.\n\nOn Monday, Ohio Right to Life CEO Peter Range said in a social media post that abortion will never only be a states' rights issue.\n\n\"If the Republican party waters down the prolife plank of its platform, it will not only lose its moral authority, but it will lose votes,\" he wrote.\n\nRange later said in an email that his organization fights for all conceived children, regardless of any political party's stance.\n\n\"We urge all of our prolife elected officials to continue to advocate for the preborn, to articulate a prolife vision for the future, and to ensure that moms and dads have everything they need to make a choice for life,\" Range said. \"We have not seen the final GOP platform language, but we hope it will include the recognition that the right to life is a fundamental part of who we are as Americans. Without the right to life no other human right can exist.\"\n\nOhio Right to Life isn't officially tied to any political party, although Republican politicians seek their endorsement when running for office and Democrats criticize the group's views and power over Republicans.\n\nMike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, will be a delegate for Trump. He also was a Trump delegate in 2020. Cleveland.com/ The Plain Dealer reached out to him for comment.\n\n\"Finally, when we look at this upcoming election, Americans have a choice between President Trump who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and President Biden who supports abortion without limits,\" Range said in his statement.\n\nIn a statement Monday evening, President Joe Biden's campaign charged that the Trump-directed GOP proposed platform change is \"a desperate attempt to conceal his extreme stance on abortion,\" and noted that Trump has said it's up to individual states to decide whether to prosecute women for abortions.\n\nBiden has said he'll work if elected to a second term to codify abortion rights that were guaranteed under Roe, which limited the procedure.\n\nSome abortion rights activists, however, do not believe this would go far enough in restoring rights to women, because states can still be allowed to generally ban abortion beyond viability.\n\nClick, the state lawmaker, said in an interview that he thinks the GOP is trying to appeal to Democrats who may be troubled by Biden's mental acuity. But the party's proposed platform is \"throwing Evangelicals under the bus and the pro-life community under the bus by weakening our stance on life,\" he said.\n\nOutside the legislature, Click works as a pastor. He has talked to people who have told them they don't like Trump. \"I say, 'That's fine, that's your opinion. But let's look at the policy. Let's look at the platform.'\"\n\nIf Republicans change the anti-abortion platform, Click said they've taken a tool out of his \"hands and relegated it to the states.\"\n\nThe GOP posted on X a letter in support of the proposed platform from leaders of the Susan B Anthony List Pro-Life America, one of the country's largest anti-abortion organizations.\n\nAnd many Republicans argue the anti-abortion platform as proposed is shorter, more concise, and still affirms the sanctity of life.\n\nBut Click isn't buying it. He said that the Ohio GOP platform is also short but firmer: \"We affirm the self-evident Truth that all people are created equal, including the unborn, and that they are endowed by their Creator with the Right to Life. The Ohio Republican Party stands in defense to protect this right.\"\n\nAndrew Tobias contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Right_to_Life", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Right to Life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beginning_of_human_personhood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beginning of human personhood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

It's also wrong.\n\nThe new platform doesn't explicitly spell out the party's desire to enact a national abortion ban, which many major news outlets took as evidence of the alleged \"softening.\" It's also shorter -- only four sentences long -- and far less detailed than the anti-abortion platforms of the party's past, which opposed public funding for organizations that perform abortions and promoted the appointment of anti-abortion judges, among other measures.\n\nBut according to legal experts, the new platform does pose an insidious threat to abortion rights by hinting at enshrining the concept of \"fetal personhood\" in the law -- a long-running goal for the right -- which would amount to a de facto national abortion ban. It also peddles contradictory promises, such as seeming to promote fetal personhood while also pledging support for IVF, which involves the disposal of embryos and would therefore be functionally impossible alongside fetal personhood.\n\nRead it for yourself:\n\nWe proudly stand for families and Life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People. We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment, which addresses the rights of citizens, is what the Republican platform has cited as the key to fetal personhood since 1984, when the party first articulated its support for \"legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.\" And, lest you forget, just last month, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would have protected contraception access at the federal level and blocked another bill that would have protected IVF.\n\nSo if you're confounded by the GOP's promises to leave abortion rights to the states and suddenly support access to contraception and IVF, you're not alone. \"I think the strategy is to be confusing,\" Mary Ziegler, a leading abortion historian and law professor at the University of California, Davis, told me, adding, \"I think that Trump's hope is that he can be confusing enough that everyone, regardless of their views on abortion, can vote for him.\"\n\nElizabeth Sepper, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law whose scholarly work has focused on reproductive rights, told me she sees the new platform as \"100 percent, a commitment to fetal personhood,\" adding that she believes it also relies on \"constitutional ignorance\" over how the Fourteenth Amendment could be marshaled to enact a federal abortion ban.\n\nConfusion over what to make of the platform also appeared to be present on the right, where some anti-abortion advocates praised the platform, while others lambasted it for not going far enough for their liking.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement Monday in response to the platform, \"It is important that the GOP reaffirmed its commitment to protect unborn life today through the 14th Amendment.\" Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, celebrated the platform's reference to the Fourteenth Amendment as \"an open door to passing strong pro-life federal legislation\"; she also noted that she and others advocating for the passage of the Life at Conception Act are \"using the Fourteenth Amendment to justify why abortion, all abortion, should be ended throughout our country.\" But Hawkins also said the updated RNC platform was \"disappointing\" in casting abortion as a state issue.\n\nAlso in the critical camp were Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, who called the new platform \"a profound disappointment to the millions of pro-life Republicans\" and urged delegates to \"restore language to our party's platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed,\" and Lila Rose, president of the anti-abortion group Live Action, who characterized the latest anti-abortion platform as \"downgraded\" from those of years past -- and blamed Trump for approving it and trying to walk back his anti-abortion stances.\n\nThe Biden campaign also blasted attempts to characterize Trump as easing up on abortion: \"Donald Trump has made it clear with his own words and actions what he will do if he regains power -- rip away women's freedoms, punish women, and ban abortion nationwide,\" campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. (As I've reported, Trump could also enact a nationwide abortion ban via the Comstock Act, which his acolytes at Project 2025 have urged him to marshal to ban mail delivery of medication abortion.)\n\nThe Trump campaign, on the other hand, praised the new Republican National Committee platform. Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump has long been consistent in supporting the rights of states to make decisions on abortion.\"\n\nBut spokespeople for the Trump campaign and the RNC did not immediately respond to Mother Jones' questions on whether Trump and the GOP more broadly support fetal personhood in law, how they square their claim to back expanding contraception and IVF access with Senate Republicans blocking votes on those issues last month, and how they respond to Republican critics like Pence.\n\nAs Ziegler sees it, evading questions about the platform's details is likely a strategic move. \"Being vague is technically a 'softening' over being clear and pro-personhood -- but primarily, it's a question mark,\" she said. \"If we don't know what it means, it might not be a 'softening' at all.\"", "source": {"uri": "motherjones.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mother Jones"}, "authors": [{"uri":

If your favorite baseball team needs pitching help this season, we might suggest its front office sign Rep. J.D. Scholten of Iowa, who recently pitched a gem for the minor league Sioux City Explorers.\n\nUp to Speed\n\nGOP Platform Marks a Departure on Abortion\n\nThe Republican National Committee's platform committee approved a 16-page draft Monday that was shorter than previous editions and watered down the party's stance on abortion, prompting muted reactions from even some staunchly pro-life senators on Capitol Hill.\n\nEvery Republican Party platform since 1984 has affirmed that the unborn have an inalienable right to life and endorsed \"legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.\" But at next week's Republican National Convention, the first since the Supreme Court overturned Roev.Wade in 2022, the party is set to approve a platform that sheds, at the direction of former President Donald Trump, the party's longstanding commitment to the unborn child's \"fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed\" in favor of ambiguous language that centered the issue on the states.\n\n\"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights,\" the 2024 platform reads. \"After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People.\" The platform also states the party opposes late-term abortion but supports access to birth control and in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments.\n\nSen. John Barrasso of Wyoming chaired the RNC's platform committee in 2016, when the party's platform endorsed both a federal restriction on abortion at the point at which an unborn baby can feel pain (effectively about 20 weeks into the pregnancy) and federal legislation to stop sex-selective abortion. The GOP did not adopt a platform in 2020. Barrasso, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, told Dispatch Politics Tuesday that he approves of the changes to the platform.\n\n\"I really support what they've done this time to shorten the entire platform, make it easier for people to read and go through-and to reflect our candidate,\" Barrasso said. \"The platform reflects President Trump's candidacy, and I'm 100 percent supportive of him.\"\n\nIndeed, the new draft platform-which will have to be approved by a vote of the full convention next week in Milwaukee-has the stamp of the party's presumptive nominee. The committee approved the platform months after Trump cut a video expressing his belief that Republicans should leave the issue of abortion to the states in the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health decision that overturned Roe, and said he would not sign a national abortion ban if Congress were to approve one.\n\nBut not all of Trump's allies said they approve of the platform committee's alterations to the abortion language. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said he shared the concerns of dismayed pro-life voters and decried the fact that the draft language neither articulated a clear policy nor included condemnations of fetal tissue harvesting and federal taxpayer funding for abortions.\n\n\"I can't say that I'm in favor of weakening the party's historic commitment to life,\" he told Dispatch Politics. \"I wouldn't compromise our stand on life at all. We ought to embrace the Dobbs decision, and the principle of Dobbs, of course, is that the voters ought to make this decision, not justices. That's absolutely right, so I think we should absolutely affirm that and, at the same time, say that, as the voters are making their decision, we want them to vote for life.\"\n\nHawley added that he was open to pro-life action at both the state and federal level. \"Where there is a national consensus that has formed, I think that you can find the votes for that in Congress. I think it's appropriate for Congress to act,\" he said.\n\nAnother pro-life Republican, Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, stopped short of a full-throated endorsement of the platform's language, but he spoke approvingly of its most appealing parts to pro-life Republicans.\n\n\"Obviously, we still retain the focus on life, which is extremely important,\" he told Dispatch Politics. \"We're the only party that really supports that, so I want to be able to keep that. President Trump's focus has been on states being more empowered, so it maintains the 14th Amendment, that section, in just a little different language for that. But we've got to continue to be able to speak up for the value of children.\"\n\nOther senators told Dispatch Politics they had not read the draft platform, among them Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a pro-choice moderate from Alaska. And Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana also said he had not read it but downplayed the importance of party platforms in general.\n\n\"I don't think anybody pays attention to platforms. I've never seen a platform influence a presidential election. I've never seen a platform influence the passage of a bill in the United States Congress,\" he said. \"I'm not saying that I don't appreciate everybody's hard work. You can't lose when you're having the free exchange of ideas, but I just don't think it matters as much.\"\n\nIn Red Ohio, Sherrod Brown Sticks to His Own Brand of Populism\n\nAs some elected Democrats call on President Joe Biden to end his reelection bid over fears he will damage the party's chances of winning competitive races this November, one of this election cycle's most vulnerable Democratic senators is offering mixed signals about the leader of his party.\n\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown told Dispatch Politics today on Capitol Hill that he is listening to \"legitimate concerns\" of Ohio voters regarding Biden's age, but refused to comment further on whether the president should drop out. Brown's remarks come a day after he reportedly told fellow Senate Democrats behind closed doors at a Tuesday lunch that Biden could not win a second term, according to a report from CNN's Dana Bash.\n\nBrown's conflicting messages on Biden's potential departure from the race comes as the three-term senator faces a strong challenge from Republican Bernie Moreno, a Cleveland-based businessman who found success in auto sales, who is backed by former President Donald Trump. The Buckeye State's Senate race-expected to be one of the closest and most expensive this year-will be competitive even as Trump is anticipated to win Ohio handily.\n\nMoreno has attempted to capitalize on Biden's negative approval ratings and concerns about his age that have intensified following his disastrous debate performance June 27. Shortly before the debate, Moreno's campaign released an advertisement attacking Brown as a Biden ally who votes with the president \"99% of the time\" while taking digs at the politicians' advanced ages; Brown is 71.\n\nHowever, Republican attempts to link Brown to Biden may not be a dependable strategy, thanks to Brown's populist brand that has found broad support while distinguishing him from other Democrats. Because of Brown's popularity, Democrats may hold on to Ohio's Senate seat-one that may decide the chamber's balance of power-while Trump simultaneously walks to an easy victory.\n\n\"Senator Brown is a particularly competitive candidate,\" Greg Lawson, a research fellow at the Buckeye Institute, a conservative think tank in Columbus, told Dispatch Politics. \"He's a very well-known quantity in Ohio. ... He has longevity, strong ties with trade unions, and his own brand, which is very important in the state.\"\n\nBrown, the lone Democrat elected to statewide office in the increasingly red Ohio since 2011, has been a fixture in state politics since the 1970s, consistently conveying a progressive, populist message that has notable similarities with Trump on policy. Both politicians support economic protectionism-criticizing trade with China while lamenting America's manufacturing decline-and support measures to secure the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nBrown's positions have found favor with working and middle-class voters across party lines, one of whom is Georgie Sundberg, a retiree from the Cleveland suburb of Burton. When she votes for Trump for the third time this November, she says she also will vote for Brown, as she has done since his first Senate run in 2006.\n\n\"[Brown] remembers the people here in Northeast Ohio,\" Sundberg told Dispatch Politics. \"He has the right positions on the border, fentanyl, and the military,\" issues she compares favorably to Trump's stances.\n\nPaul Beck, a political science professor at Ohio State University, told Dispatch Politics that voters like Sundberg are not an anomaly. \"Ohio voters are quite willing to differentiate between candidates they like and have voted for in the past, regardless of party,\" said Beck.\n\nSundberg's loyalty to Trump hasn't caused her to be persuaded to vote for Moreno. \"If there was another Republican [nominee] that had Trump's backing, then maybe I'd consider voting for them. Bernie Moreno is just not good enough.\"\n\nLack of enthusiasm for Moreno among some Ohioans showed in an early June Marist poll showing Brown leading Moreno by 5 percent among registered voters. In addition, the latest campaign finance reports ending in March show Brown with nearly $16 million cash on hand, while Moreno has slightly above $2 million.\n\nBrown's advantage may be in part due to his campaign's early media offensive, releasing several ads-both positive and negative-including one attacking Moreno as an untrustworthy auto salesman who will \"say anything\" to get elected.\n\nHowever, the Biden administration's own vulnerabilities, particularly on the economy, may provide a boost to Brown's challenger as the election draws nearer. \"No matter who's at the top of the ticket, an issue like inflation is going to be an anchor that could bring down Brown's support,\" Lawson of the Buckeye Institute told Dispatch Politics.\n\nLawson also suggested that Trump's support for Moreno will work to his advantage in driving Republican turnout, yet cautioned that while \"a Trump endorsement is influential, [it is] not decisive.\"\n\nAs Brown and other Democrats fret over whether Biden will harm Democratic victory prospects, Beck from Ohio State told Dispatch Politics that the Senate election will be competitive no matter who leads the party's ticket.\n\n\"It's going to be a tight race with or without Biden,\" Beck said.\n\nNotable and Quotable\n\n\"The president will hold a press conference-I guess, a 'big boy' press conference, we're calling it-and take some questions from y'all.\"\n\nRead more at The Dispatch", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_warren@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Michael Warren", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barrasso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Barrasso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Windsor, which said that the federal government could not treat state-sanctioned same-sex \"marriages\" differently from traditional heterosexual marriages.\n\nThe platform also condemned the landmark 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriages throughout the U.S. The Obergefell ruling \"robbed 320 million Americans of their legitimate constitutional authority to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman,\" the party said.\n\nThe Republican Party did not release an updated platform in 2020. However, in its 2024 platform, the GOP significantly dialed back its language on marriage, remarking on it only briefly while vowing to \"empower American families.\"\n\n\"Republicans will promote a culture that values the sanctity of marriage, the blessings of childhood, the foundational role of families, and supports working parents,\" the platform says. \"We will end policies that punish families.\"\n\nThe GOP's 2024 platform is largely seen as being heavily guided by presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. CBS News referred to the document as \"Trump-influenced,\" while NPR said the platform \"follows Trump's lead.\"\n\nTrump has given conflicting answers on same-sex marriage in the past, though in 2016 he said he was \"fine\" with the Supreme Court's ruling on that policy, and in 2019 one of his advisors reaffirmed his acceptance of \"gay marriage.\"\n\nThe GOP platform has softened in other ways since 2016. The 2024 Republican National Convention's platform committee also moved this week to adopt new language regarding abortion, removing from the platform a \"right to life\" plank as well as a call for a national law protecting unborn life.\n\nPrevious versions of the document said that unborn children have a \"fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed\" and called for a constitutional amendment to guarantee that right.\n\nBut this year's platform uses much more moderate language and emphasizes the role of states in protecting life.\n\n\"We proudly stand for families and life,\" the new document reads. \"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights.\"", "source": {"uri": "ncregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Catholic Register"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States v.

Newsroom, Jul 8, 2024 / 16:50 pm\n\nThe 2024 Republican National Convention's platform committee voted on Monday to adopt new language regarding abortion, removing a \"right to life\" plank and a call for a national law protecting unborn life from the party platform.\n\nThe platform is an aspirational document that is drafted and approved by party delegates during election years. It is meant to outline the party's policy goals for the coming years.\n\nWhile previous versions of the document said that unborn children have a \"fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed\" and called for a constitutional amendment to guarantee that right, this year's platform uses much more moderate language and emphasizes the role of states in protecting life.\n\nIt reads: \"We proudly stand for families and life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process, and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights.\"\n\nThe platform goes on to laud the overturn of Roe v. Wade and then express support for prenatal care, birth control, and in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n\"After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the states and to a vote of the people. We will oppose late-term abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF,\" the new document reads.\n\nThe draft, which according to the Washington Post was approved in an 84-18 vote, was written by former President Donald Trump's campaign and adopted at his urging.\n\nThe Trump campaign celebrated the platform's passage in a Monday statement in which they said it \"articulates his [Trump's] vision to Make America Great Again in a way that is concise and digestible for every voter.\"\n\nSince April, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee has consistently signaled his desire to keep abortion exclusively a state issue. During a televised debate last month with President Joe Biden, he asserted that the 2021 Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court decision that reversed Roe v. Wade means that abortion is now up to the states.\n\nLeading pro-life Republicans have echoed this sentiment, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio saying in a Sunday CNN interview that \"our platform has to reflect our nominee and our nominee's position actually happens to be one grounded in reality ... His position on this has been the reality that you can't pass a federal law [protecting unborn life] even if we wanted to.\"\n\nThe reaction from the pro-life community, meanwhile, was mixed.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, praised the platform, saying it demonstrates that the Republican Party \"remains strongly pro-life at the national level.\"\n\nKristi Hamrick, a representative for Students for Life Action, told CNA that while \"not perfect\" the platform represents \"two very big wins\" for the pro-life movement: acknowledging that the 14th Amendment protects all life, including unborn life, and condemning late-term abortion.\n\nHamrick said that she has been working with the Trump campaign and delegates to the Republican National Convention to stress the importance of the Republican Party prioritizing the protection of unborn life.\n\nEven with a reduced legislative focus, Hamrick said there is a lot of important work a future Trump administration could do for the pro-life movement including reversing \"a lot of weaponized federal policy\" that she said is \"prejudiced in favor of abortion.\"\n\n\"If we detangled and cut out the cancer of abortion and abortion-related programming from our federal budgets, we can have a healthier budget and a life-affirming budget.\" If Republicans were to achieve those wins under a Trump administration, Hamrick said it would constitute \"a very vibrant and vigorous term.\"\n\nTags:AbortionElection 2024GOPPeter PinedoPresidential Election 2024republican Previous post Vatican prohibits customary Traditional Latin Mass for pilgrims in Spain Next post This is the most recent story.

Sadly, the GOP following Trump's lead on abortion is a major departure from the direction anti-abortion activists have steered the party in over the past several decades.\n\nAs a young voter who is pro-life, I came into conservatism at the peak of the anti-abortion movement's success, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 while I was in college. I'm saddened that it appears the party will not continue down that path into my adulthood.\n\nRepublican platform abandons those of us who are pro-life\n\nThe single mention of abortion in the official GOP platform reads, \"We will oppose Late Term Abortion.\"\n\nCompare that with the Republican platform from 2016, the last year the GOP produced an official platform, and the difference is stark. The term \"abortion\" is mentioned 35 times throughout the text, discussing varying degrees of federal bans that Republicans would support.\n\nBefore Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Republicans had it easy. They could promise far-reaching abortion bans once Roe was overturned and not deal with the political consequences. It was a good topic to score harmless points on.\n\nHowever, since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, support for abortion rights has ticked up and the issue has become the biggest electoral struggle the GOP has faced. In the 2022 midterm elections, 24% of voters \u2012 with the share of Democrats nearly tripling that of Republicans \u2012 listed abortion as the single biggest factor in their vote, and 38% said it heavily influenced their decision to vote in the election.\n\nNikki Haley is the answer: Do Republicans realize Trump is the old guy if Biden drops out? Haley would fix that.\n\nThe flurry of ballot measures that enshrined abortion rights at the state level following the decision also didn't bode well for the GOP. In these states, Democratic women are significantly more likely to vote in elections where abortion is on the ballot, and Republican women are conversely slightly less likely to vote.\n\nI wish I could say I was surprised, but the modern GOP shifts its positions wherever the voters want them to. With its softening on the issue of abortion, the Republican Party proves there is no issue where it will hold the line.\n\nAbortion is political kryptonite for the GOP. It shouldn't matter.\n\nAlthough I understand the electoral difficulty of selling the message of protecting life, I am saddened that the GOP has been so quick to abandon the most important civil rights issue of my generation.\n\nSCOTUS doing its job: Have you realized the Supreme Court is the only part of our government working?\n\nAttaching the party to Trump's whims is a recipe for disaster, especially when his position changes with the wind. If the GOP of old didn't die under Trump's first presidency, the transformations the party is undergoing under his leadership this time will certainly lead to the death of the Republican Party we knew.\n\nThe anti-abortion movement for decades was a pillar of the Republican Party's base, and the GOP could reliably bank on their votes regardless of the candidate purely because of their ability to nominate conservative justices with the jurisprudence required to overturn Roe.\n\nRather than taking on the admittedly daunting task of changing hearts and minds on the issue, the GOP has thrown the anti-abortion movement by the wayside the moment it became politically inconvenient to stand with us.\n\nThe promise of Roe v. Wade one day being overturned produced a stalwart voting bloc of religious voters loyal to the Republican Party. This population viewed the overturning of Roe as an important victory in a long road to equal protection of life rather than the end point the GOP has seemingly deemed it.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, an unwavering leader of the pro-life movement, in a statement encouraged \"delegates attending next week's Republican Convention to restore language to our party's platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.\"\n\nI agree with Pence's calls, but I'm skeptical that any such change will come. The Republican Party's kismet lies wherever Trump guides it, and Trump's stance on abortion goes wherever it gets him the most votes.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

We're going to be a pro-life party. We're going to be a pro-family party,\" Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who served as the chairwoman of the RNC platform committee, told the Washington Examiner. \"The language needed to be changed because the goal of setting aside [Roe v. Wade] was achieved, and it recognizes that that goal was achieved after 50 years.\"\n\nThe platform change happened just in time for the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week, when delegates will elevate former President Donald Trump as their party's nominee. Trump has urged GOP lawmakers to go on the offensive regarding abortion and has made it a crucial part of his campaign by taking credit for the reversal of Roe through his appointment of three Supreme Court justices.\n\nSince then, Trump has argued abortion decisions should now be left up to states, which Republicans say helps to declaw Democrats on one of their top issues.\n\n\"If you go back a year ago, [Trump's] been very clear that now that Roe v. Wade has been addressed by the Supreme Court, that it's going to be up to the states, not the federal government,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) told the Washington Examiner. \"And he staked that claim very early off and, I think, to the frustration of a lot of Democrats who wanted to make that an issue. President Trump pretty much took it off the table.\"\n\nThe updated language could also serve to help vulnerable Republicans running in competitive districts won by President Joe Biden in 2020 by giving them an extra line of defense against Democratic attacks on the issue.\n\n\"I think that the more we can do to show that we respect women, no matter the choice they feel they must make, the better off we are,\" Rep. Marc Molinaro (R-NY), who is running in one of the most competitive House districts of the 2024 cycle, said. \"We recognize that any decision to bring life in the world or to seek an abortion is just a tremendously difficult decision for a woman and for families, and the more we can do to respect that and support those difficult choices, the better off we are.\"\n\nBut some RNC delegates have pushed back against the language changes, arguing it goes too far to water down the party's stance in a way that GOP voters don't support.\n\n\"I understand where former President Trump is coming from,\" Mike McMullin, a GOP delegate from Pennsylvania, told the Washington Examiner. \"But I also have heard enough from my constituents like, 'Don't change the platform. Stick to the pro-life. Don't waver.'\"\n\nAnother delegate from Pennsylvania, former state Rep. Richard Saccone, emphasized that coming out against the platform should not be equated with crossing Trump, but he argued the national party should consider \"all the angles\" of the issue.\n\n\"Especially [from] the base,\" Saccone told the Washington Examiner. \"And the base doesn't want something like that. They want the current platform. And [party leaders] need to hear why. Part of the reason is that the current platform delineates very well.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDemocrats have already pushed against the updated platform, arguing it does not provide for more protections and amounts to a \"lie\" to \"continue to take our rights away.\"\n\n\"They haven't softened anything. I don't believe anything the RNC says,\" Rep. Becca Balint (D-VT) said. \"I don't believe anything Trump says. They are so adamantly against women having the right to choose. So, this framing that it's a softening -- no.

Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post\n\nRepublican delegates adopted presumptive nominee Donald Trump's proposed convention platform at a meeting in Milwaukee on Monday, abandoning long-held positions on abortion and same-sex marriage while embracing new plans for mass deportation and a new opposition to changing the retirement age for Social Security.\n\n\"This is something hopefully you will pass. You will pass it quickly, and we will show unity in our party as opposed to the disaster that is going on with the Democrats,\" Trump said when he called into the meeting, according to people present who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private event. \"We are going to win because we have right on our side. We have good on our side. I think, frankly, we have God on our side. These people are opposed to religion.\"\n\nThe final vote, according to a person present during the closed-door proceedings, was 84-18.\n\nThe document, with a long introduction in the voice of Trump, overruled the concerns of antiabortion activists who had announced before the meeting that they wanted the document to explicitly call for a constitutional amendment to give embryos or fetuses legal rights.\n\nInstead the document said that the Constitution's due process clause grants states the power \"to pass laws protecting those rights.\"\n\n\"After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the states and to a vote of the people,\" the document says, according a copy of the document obtained by The Washington Post. \"We will oppose late term abortion while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe document was presented Monday to members of the Republican convention platform committee, a group handpicked by leaders of the Trump campaign. The 2016 platform, which Trump used in his 2020 reelection campaign, called for a constitutional amendment to affirm the constitutional due process rights of embryos and fetuses, and a national law that would ban abortion, with some exceptions, after about 20 weeks of gestation.\n\nTrump has changed his position on the issue since the Supreme Court overturned the fundamental right to the procedure in earlier stages of pregnancy. He now argues that each state should come up with its own regulations.\n\nTony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council and a member of the platform committee, expressed disappointment about the outcome. \"The 2024 platform is a decent statement of campaign priorities, but not necessarily the enduring principles of the party,\" he said in a statement that objected to the lack of opportunity for amendments. \"Unfortunately, the process was unbecoming of constitutional conservatives.\"\n\nRalph Reed, the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, who had publicly warned Trump about changing the abortion language, thanked the former president in a statement for including language that said the due process clause of the constitution gives states the power to restrict abortion.\n\n\"That language has been in the GOP platform for 40 years and reflects the view of Ronald Reagan,\" Reed said. \"While aspirational, it applies to both the states and the federal government.\"\n\nEight antiabortion and social conservative leaders, including Reed and Perkins, wrote a June 10 letter to Trump demanding that the platform include support for federal legislative limits on abortion and contain the following sentence: \"We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to children before birth.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe platform reflects a full Trump takeover of the party and reads almost like one of his rally speeches. It officially enshrines mass deportations of millions of undocumented immigrants as the platform of the Republican Party; proposes ending the Education Department; calls to \"deport pro-Hamas radicals\"; build a \"great Iron Dome\" over the country; \"end the weaponization of the Department of Justice\"; cancel the electric vehicle mandate and \"FIGHT FOR AND PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WITH NO CUTS, INCLUDING NO CHANGES TO THE RETIREMENT AGE.\"\n\n\"We will implement measures to secure our elections, including voter ID, highly sophisticated paper ballots, proof of citizenship, and same day voting,\" the platform reads.\n\nThe platform also shows how far the party has moved on trade issues under Trump. The party now supports tariffs, according to the platform. Language from the 2016 Republican platform supporting Puerto Rico's ability to seek statehood was also dropped from the new document.\n\nThe 2016 document was far more extensive, with 54 pages of tightly packed text. Trump advisers have signaled that they wanted the new document to directly reflect the views of Trump, a break from past tradition where Republican activists are empowered to shape the document in consultation with the presumptive nominee's campaign, often resulting in language that was different in emphasis and detail from the candidate's own public statements.\n\nVincent Haley, a former deputy assistant to the president during Trump's first term, largely wrote the document presented Monday, according to people familiar with the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private activities. Trump later reviewed and edited the document, the people said. He wrote the headers on the sections, changed language and expanded the list of bullet points in the introduction from 10 to 20, one of the people said.\n\nThe former president called in Monday to a meeting of the platform committee, a person familiar with the meeting said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"For decades, our politicians sold our jobs and livelihoods to the highest bidders overseas with unfair trade deals and a blind faith in the siren song of globalism. They insulated themselves from criticism and the consequences of their own bad actions, allowing our borders to be overrun, our cities to be overtaken by crime, our system of justice to be weaponized, and our young people to develop a sense of hopelessness and despair. They rejected our history and our values. Quite simply, they did everything in their power to destroy our country,\" the Republican Party's official platform now reads.\n\nThe new platform draft also removes language from 2016 condemning the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 decision to grant same-sex couples the right to marry. The new language does not weigh in on same-sex marriage.\n\n\"Republicans will promote a culture that values the sanctity of marriage, the blessings of childhood, and the foundational role of families, and supports working parents,\" it says instead. \"We will end policies that punish families.\"\n\nThe 2016 platform endorsed the idea that parents could seek \"conversion therapy\" for children because of their sexuality. \"We support the right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children,\" it read.\n\nThe new platform drops that language. It stops short of seeking to bar parents from seeking medical treatment for minor children, while condemning any taxpayer funding of such procedures. \"We will keep men out of women's sports, ban taxpayer funding for sex change surgeries, and stop taxpayer-funded schools from promoting gender transition, reverse Biden's radical rewrite of Title IX education regulations, and restore protections for women and girls,\" the platform says.\n\nThe language around abortion in the new platform does acknowledge the 14th Amendment, while making no mention of further changes to the Constitution. \"We proudly stand for families and life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights,\" it says.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nBiden is seeing a different world from other Democrats filed under: Donald

RNC Committeewoman Rages After Trump Loyalists Ram GOP Platform Through Without Debate", "body": "Republican National Committee member Gail Ruzicka fumed that pro-Trump loyalists \"rolled\" the organization's platform committee without debate in the push to adopt the new GOP platform in Milwaukee on Monday.\n\nThe platform was passed with an 84-14 vote, signaling strong support within the committee for what is the most comprehensive platform update since 2016, heavily influenced by former President Donald Trump's vision for a second term.\n\n\"This is his platform,\" asserted Lara Trump, RNC co-chair and daughter-in-law of Trump.\n\nThe platform, now awaiting full adoption at the Republican National Convention next week, outlines a bold agenda. It calls for the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, protections for Social Security and Medicare without cuts, and significant federal funding cuts for schools promoting \"critical race theory\" and \"gender ideology.\"\n\nOn Monday night, however, Ruzicka -- a Utah-based conservative activist and pro-life delegate -- spoke briefly to a WISN 12 News reporter as she left the meeting as he asked about what happened at the closed-door meeting.\n\nStunned, the RNC committeewoman said: \"This has never happened before. I guess I've done this several times. There were no committees. We always had subcommittees where we can go in and work on a section of the platform. We can propose amendments, debate them, add them. Always happens. I've done it many times. that would usually take today and then tomorrow we would come back and meet as a complete platform and sometimes there'd be more amendments. They didn't allow any amendments. They didn't allow any discussion. They rolled us. That's what they did.\"\n\nShe added: \"We only spent thousands of dollars to be here. And what we think they told us they were going to do isn't what happened. None of it. None of it happened. I've never seen this happen before. I don't understand why they did it.\"\n\nSpeaking with Fox News on Tuesday, Ruzicka, repeated her anger at the party leaders for \"railroading\" the platform through and specifically protested changes to the party position on abortion. The new platform removed the call for a constitutional ban on abortion from the platform for the first time in 40 years and now reads that the party only opposes \"late term abortions.\"\n\nShe said: \"I want something that says the unborn baby has a fundamental right to life that can't be infringed. That's pro-life and that's not in there. If we had met we could have made some little fixes and ended up with everybody happy instead of just railroading this through and not giving us a chance to read or amend it.\"\n\nDespite Ruzicka's criticism six pro-life groups voted to enforce the new RNC platform.\n\nMichael Whatley, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, defended the platform and emphasized discussions around its formation and strong majority support: \"We had plenty of votes, we had plenty of discussion on it. We feel very, very good. We had an overwhelming vote in support of the platform.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lara Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social Security (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-gender_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-gender movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Critical race theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISN-TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WISN-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RNC-platform.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716769", "eventUri": "eng-9716769", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Platforms do not bind any elected member of any political party, but they are the main symbolic way that federal and state parties debate the policy positions that can become party dogma.\n\nThis year's draft platform -- which echoes Trump in suggesting states should handle abortion -- is a nod to the sensitivity of the subject. Although the former president clinched the Supreme Court majority that overturned abortion rights in 2021, he is wary of hurting his electoral case by embracing a federal version of abortion bans that have passed in states.\n\nThe platform's abortion framing drew disappointment from social conservatives in Maine. Carroll Conley, the executive director of the evangelical-aligned Christian Civic League of Maine, said Tuesday he is \"thankful that whoever is responsible for the change in this platform was not in charge\" of the GOP in 1860 when it adopted a platform that sought to abolish slavery.\n\n\"I'm deeply disappointed,\" Conley said of this year's platform. \"But once again, I'm reminded that Christians desiring to positively impact our communities, motivated by love for our neighbors, don't rest our hope in a party or a candidate.\"\n\nFormer Maine Republican Party Chair Demi Kouzounas, who is running against U.S. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, in November, did not respond to requests for comment. She was among the 112 delegates on the GOP's platform committee who met Monday to draft the document, according to a New York Times report.\n\nPastor Bob Emrich, a Republican who serves at Emmanuel Bible Baptist Church in Plymouth and who previously chaired the Christian Civic League, expressed frustration at the GOP for its move to \"soften the position on abortion in order to gain points in a campaign.\"\n\nEmrich has not yet decided to vote against Trump come November but said he is \"alarmed\" at Trump's influence in shaping the platform. He also said he hopes the platform gets changed at next week's convention.\n\n\"The Republican Party is in danger of losing some of its most passionate base by surrendering on very important issues,\" Emrich said. \"I think it's an attempt to appeal to maybe some soft Democrats or independent voters. There isn't any middle ground on abortion.\"\n\nThe 2022 election came in the wake of the high court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Democrats ran hard on abortion. After losing to Gov. Janet Mills, former Gov. Paul LePage blamed that topic for his poor showing. He awkwardly answered debate questions on it, including when he shocked allies by threatening to veto a 15-week abortion ban.\n\nIn Augusta, Republicans have unsuccessfully dug in against Mills-led efforts to expand abortion, but many of them have generally supported keeping Maine's liberal laws on the books, including state Rep. Austin Theriault, R-Fort Kent, who is now trying to unseat U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat and Marine veteran, in the swing 2nd District.\n\nHe did not mention abortion in a statement after getting asked about the new Republican platform. Instead, his campaign nodded to points of agreement with abortion-rights supporters in the wake of a February court decision in Alabama that effectively banned IVF, which sent national Republicans scrambling to avow support for the pregnancy treatment.\n\n\"Austin 100 percent supports IVF, access to birth control and giving expectant mothers the support they need,\" Theriault campaign manager Shawn Roderick said, before pivoting to an unrelated criticism of Golden over not saying whether he will vote for President Joe Biden in November.\n\nDuring its convention in April, the Maine GOP adopted a platform that declared support for \"the sanctity of human life -- from conception to natural death\" and opposition to \"the use of taxpayer funds for abortions or activities that run counter to the sanctity of human life.\"\n\nTrump, the first former president to become a convicted felon, faces numerous pending criminal cases but is leading the race while benefiting from Biden's stumbles during a June 27 debate that resulted in numerous Democrats imploring the president to drop out of the race.", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangor

While both issues have been topline issues for Trump throughout his political career, the platform's inclusion of other provisions highlighted the extent to which his own agenda had inserted itself into the party.\n\nThat Trump would exert outsized influence over the RNC is hardly surprising given he essentially handpicked the party leadership. The RNC installed then-North Carolina GOP Chairman Michael Whatley as GOP chairman in March after Trump backed him for the post. It also tapped Trump's daughter-in-law Lara to serve as co-chair.\n\nWhen Trump emerged on the political scene in the 2016 Republican primary, he often feuded with the RNC and even accused the party of being biased against his candidacy.\n\nIn the crowded primary field, he fended off many conventional Republicans and traded barbs with his opponents over his challenges to Republican orthodoxy, namely on free trade and foreign policy.\n\nAfter Trump claimed the nomination, the party apparatus reluctantly embraced the outsider, first-time candidate. At the time, the RNC was under the leadership of Reince Priebus, whom Trump subsequently named his chief of staff. He, however, only lasted half a year in the post.\n\nIn the 2020 election, by contrast, Trump stood as an incumbent and faced a handful of minor challengers. At that time, the RNC was under the leadership of Ronna McDaniel and did not hold any primary debates. The 2024 primary cycle saw McDaniel organize a number of debates, however, though Trump did not participate in any.\n\nThe GOP's embrace of the Trump platform on Monday appears to signal that the policy fights between old guard Republicans and the America First contingent have been largely decided in favor of the latter camp. Included in the platform are multiple chapters addressing cost of living, foreign competition, cryptocurrency and educational opportunities, most of which appear aimed at younger voters and clash somewhat with traditionalist Republican attitudes.\n\nAbortion\n\nTrump appointed three justices to the Supreme Court, all of whom voted to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion set in Roe v. Wade. He has stood by the decision, but called for leaving the issue of abortion bans to the states and expressed support for exceptions in the case of rape, incest and life of the mother. His own position throughout the 2024 primary attracted the ire of some pro-life advocates and his Republican rivals, many of whom favored national bans and fewer, if any, exceptions.\n\nThe new party platform does not call for a national ban, explicitly, but asserts that the 14th Amendment guarantees \"no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.\" It also espouses opposition to late-term abortion and support for protecting access to in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nWhile the platform does not call for a human life amendment and marks a change to prior party platforms in that respect, some pro-life advocates see the current position as following in the spirit of prior Republican efforts.\n\n\"This party has stood for life for a half century and for 40 years has called for either the passage of a human life amendment to the US Constitution or an acknowledgement that the unborn child has a right to life under the due process clause of the 14th amendment,\" Faith and Freedom Coalition founder Ralph Reed said Monday on the \"John Solomon Reports\" podcast. \"This platform, which was passed today in Milwaukee, continues that tradition by making it clear that the unborn child has an inalienable right to life that cannot be infringed that that life is protected under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, which by the way, was Ronald Reagan's position.\"\n\n\"And as a result of that, states are free to protect unborn life. It also calls for a ban on late-term abortion,\" he went on. \"And that language clearly anticipates both state and federal action. And the 14th Amendment applies to both the federal government and the states.\"\n\nNew York GOP Rep. Claudia Tenney said on the \"Just the News, No Noise\" television show: \"I'm glad the platform's spelled this out onto the 14th Amendment for the freedom and the right to life, but also spelled out that we are against late-term abortion, and that the Democrats are the extremists on this position.\n\n\"They support late-term abortion. They support post-birth abortion. ... We know this really has got to be our message to everyone - to understand the Democrats are going to try to run on the abortion issue. And I think that being unified on this and having a message as we do, I think is going to be important going into the election this fall.\"\n\nForeign affairs\n\nAmong the most contentious of Trump's positions in the 2016 primary was his rejection of the Bush-era \"neoconservative\" and interventionist foreign policy. Throughout his tenure, moreover, his efforts to make NATO allies contribute more to the alliance rankled many foreign policy hawks.\n\nThrough Trump's tenure, the majority of NATO members did not meet their pledges to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense. The former president, while in office, repeatedly pushed for NATO members to meet their spending targets and even suggested the U.S. might leave the alliance if they failed to do so. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in February of this year announced that a majority of the nation's members were on track to meet the spending target.\n\n\"I said NATO has to pay its bills, and if it doesn't pay its bills, we are not going to protect you. THE MONEY CAME POURING IN! Under other Presidents, NATO was BROKE,\" Trump posted in March.\n\nThe platform doubled down on Trump's prior efforts, vowing to restore \"peace through strength\" and to \"strengthen Alliances by ensuring that our Allies must meet their obligations to invest in our Common Defense and by restoring Peace to Europe.\"\n\nTrade\n\nChapter five of the platform addresses proposals to protect American domestic industries and to revitalize manufacturing, in part through tariffs. It further commits the party to \" rebalancing Trade, securing Strategic Independence, and revitalizing Manufacturing.\"\n\nThat section included a pledge that \"Republicans will support baseline Tariffs on Foreign made goods, pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, and respond to unfair Trading practices.\"\n\nTrump's myriad tariff policies during his administration, as well as his subsequent proposals while out of office, have long attracted considerable scrutiny from free trade advocates, who formerly held considerable sway within the Republican Party.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nFurther showing Trump's direct influence over the party's positions are the inclusion of provisions addressing cryptocurrency.\n\nThe RNC platform opposes the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and promises to \"defend the right to mine Bitcoin, and ensure every American has the right to self-custody of their Digital Assets, and transact free from Government Surveillance and Control.\n\nThe Trump campaign in May announced that it would begin accepting donations in cryptocurrency and the former president the same month voiced opposition to a CBDC. Cryptocurrency moguls Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss last month became some of his most high-profile donors to use the format and donated $1 million each.\n\nCost of living\n\nChapter four addressed cost of living and prioritized housing affordability, saying that Republicans would \"reduce mortgage rates by slashing Inflation, open limited portions of Federal Lands to allow for new home construction, promote homeownership through Tax Incentives and support for first-time buyers, and cut unnecessary Regulations that raise housing costs.\" Other provisions addressed the party's commitment to lowering the costs of higher education, healthcare, and everyday costs.", "source": {"uri": "theminnesotasun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Minnesota Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Due Process Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_termination_of_pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Late termination of pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 Republican Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronna_McDaniel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronna McDaniel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reince_Priebus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reince Priebus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_(policy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "America First (policy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Reed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditionalist_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traditionalist conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Tenney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Tenney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

We can propose amendments, debate them, add them.\" This time, she said, speaking of loyalists to former President Donald Trump, \"They didn't allow any amendments. They didn't allow any discussion. They rolled us. That's what they did.\"\n\nRuzicka was apparently oblivious that the old GOP is dead. So is dissent in its ranks. The party of Ronald Reagan was long ago replaced by the party of Donald Trump, but Monday's debacle over the drafting of the party's platform, a platform that deletes some of the positions and goals the party has held for decades, is a new low.\n\nThe new GOP platform, which is expected to be formally approved at next week's Republican National Convention, reads like a combination of Trump speeches and social media posts. Gone are long-standing Republican principles such as support for a national abortion ban and support for free trade. That has been replaced by language conveying Trump's lust for revenge against his political enemies. For example: \"We will hold accountable those who have misused the power of Government to unjustly prosecute their Political Opponents.\"\n\nRuzicka was particularly upset that, on the matter of abortion, the platform now says only that the GOP opposes \"late-term abortions.\" \"If you look at it, it has Donald Trump written all over it,\" said RNC co-chair Lara Trump, the former president's daughter-in-law. \"This is his platform.\" And his daughter-in-law's serving as a party chair is one of several other signs that the GOP is his party.\n\nWhile it's true that platforms are not controlling or enforceable, they do proclaim what a political party wants known about its priorities before a presidential election. What this platform proclaims is that the GOP's positions are whatever a candidate convicted of 34 felony counts thinks are in his best interests.\n\nFor starters, while there was no Republican platform drafted in 2020, the GOP's 66-page 2016 platform read like a salute to Reagan and his values and cited him and his policies more than 10 times. Reagan doesn't get a single mention in 2024. In his place is a 16-page platform titled \"Make America Great Again.\" It cites and praises Trump nearly 20 times.\n\nAs for policy, the new platform replaces well-established GOP positions on issues like free trade with Trump's embrace of massive tariffs on imports. The most glaring reversal, though, is on abortion. For more than 40 years, Republican platforms have called for a national abortion ban. The 2024 platform drops that formerly bedrock principle. Why? Trump understands that, in light of Roe v. Wade's being overturned, a call for a national abortion ban would hurt him politically. Polls show that nearly 80 % of Americans oppose such a ban. Trump wanted it gone, and it is gone.\n\nAnd the fact that anti-abortion-rights groups that had been critical of the proposed platform have now fallen into line behind it further illustrates Trump's absolute control of the party. Trump knows that if he declared tomorrow that he's reversing himself on any of the key issues in the platform, the base would go along with him.\n\nYale professor Jason Stanley, who wrote the book \"How Fascism Works,\" explained in 2020 that Trump has forged with his supporters \"a fascist connection of total loyalty\" and said that \"his supporters seem to see the world through a prism. Are you with him or against them?\"\n\nAuthoritarianism expert Ruth Ben-Ghiat, who wrote \"Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present,\" has warned for years that what she sees with Trump and his base is \"an allegiance based on loyalty to a person -- not a party and not to a set of principles.\" More recently, Ben-Ghiat noted that Trump's creation of a \"personality cult\" with blind loyalty from his base is one of the defining characteristics of fascist movements.\n\nThis a big reason Trump's fire hose of lies -- more than 30,000 \"untruths,\" per The Washington Post, in his four years as president -- doesn't cause his base to question its loyalty to him. Stanley explained that many of Trump's supporters view him as \"infallible,\" adding insightfully, \"There's the denial of reality that is characteristic of fascism, as if reality is just a construction.\" Meaning whatever Trump says is the truth is the truth.\n\nIt's also why Trump can rewrite the 2024 GOP platform to suit his own interests and his base stays loyal. To the base, the GOP is no longer about policy or principles. It's only about Trump. And that's exactly the way Trump wants it.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lara Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Stanley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benito Mussolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cult of personality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The RNC's platform committee moved to adopt the document this week that does not include a national abortion ban.\n\nOhio Republican U.S. Senate Candidate Bernie Moreno supports the platform. He says abortion is now in the states' hands since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and the focus should be on women and their babies.\n\nThe platform states \"We proudly stand for families and life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process, and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights.\"\n\nIt does not include a national abortion ban or give a specific week at which an abortion would be illegal.\n\nThe 2016 Republican platform mentioned abortion 35 times. The 2024 platform mentions it only once in opposing late-term abortions.\n\nIt also says the Republican Party will support mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control and IVF fertility treatments.\n\nAt a news conference in Columbus Wednesday morning Moreno supported the platform.\n\n\"It's predominantly a state issue, and we're going to work on ways to make certain that moms have better access to health care, that women have better access to contraception,\" Moreno said.\n\n\"There's not a Republican senator I know that's against any forms of the contraception that's reported in the media. And we're going to make certain that adoption services are more readily available.\"\n\nMoreno said he still supports a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy with common sense restrictions after that time period.\n\nThe platform's top priorities include immigration and border security, ending inflation, American energy production dominance, large tax cuts for workers, restoring peace in Europe and no cuts for Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\"We're going to secure the border,\" Moreno said. \"We're going to have dominant American energy here made in the United States. That gives us national security. We're going to make certain that we lower prices by cutting government spending and we're going to have American strength and project that strength so we have peace and no more endless wars.\"\n\nThe platform is expected to be officially approved the first day of the Republican National Convention on July 15.", "source": {"uri": "10tv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "10TV - WBNS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade era.\n\nSeveral panelists, including a former Trump administration official, severely criticized the 2024 GOP platform, which was approved by the Republican National Convention's platform committee on Monday.\n\nWhat's Going on With Republicans and Abortion?\n\nSince Roe's overturn in 2022 the pro-life movement has struggled to achieve any significant policy wins at the polls, leading some Republicans to believe abortion is a losing issue.\n\nThis belief appeared to be reflected in the GOP's new platform, which removed a long-standing \"right to life\" plank and any call for a national law protecting unborn life.\n\nTom McClusky, a veteran operative in the pro-life movement, led the charge in slamming Republicans for backing away from the life issue.\n\n\"The RNC platform, I'm sorry, it is the worst platform I've ever seen,\" McClusky said. \"The platform, to me, has always been a promissory note. This is what the Republican Party stands for, this is the ideals that we strive for, and we've lost that now.\"\n\nHe pointed to the Biden administration's actions to promote abortion, saying it has \"proven\" that abortion cannot \"just go back to the states.\"\n\n\"Look at everything that he [Biden] has done,\" he said. \"They've turned our veterans' hospitals into abortuaries. They've turned our military into abortion travel services. They've taken the Department of Justice and gone after people who stand up for life.\"\n\n\"That is not something the states can stop,\" he added. \"That is only something the federal government can do.\"\n\n'Quietly Transforming Every Agency Into Planned Parenthood'\n\nKaty Talento, another panelist and former Trump administration Domestic Policy Council adviser, also criticized Republicans for backing away from the national abortion debate.\n\nAccording to Talento, the Biden administration has been \"quietly transforming every [government] agency into Planned Parenthood.\"\n\nLeaving the status quo regarding abortion, Talento claimed, would greatly advantage the abortion industry and result in more deaths of not only unborn babies but also pregnant women.\n\n\"I would strongly urge any hand-wringing politician worried about suburban women to read the FDA label before advocating for [abortion] pill-pushing on demand. The next woman bleeding out in the fetal position could be their daughter or their granddaughter,\" Talento warned.\n\n\"It appears that there is little courage or appetite among our national leaders to try to protect unborn Americans with new federal laws,\" she added. However, she emphasized, \"there are too many radical policies implemented by Team Biden throughout many agencies to let any new president or cabinet secretary off the hook.\"\n\nPromoting Marriage and Families\n\nVarious panelists also suggested strategies to push back against abortion and reverse the ongoing decline in births.\n\nEmma Waters, a senior research associate at The Heritage Foundation, said that promoting a culture conducive to life involves all aspects of society, government, and religion as well the culture at large.\n\nGovernment policy, Waters said, must include not only on materially supporting mothers but also on promoting stable marriages and families.\n\n\"All policy must be pro-family policy,\" she said. \"We don't need a separate policy group focused on family policy, we need those who are working in foreign policy, those who are in education, those who are in welfare and beyond, asking themselves, 'Does this policy that I'm putting forward help support and encourage the family?'\"\n\n\"To solve the fertility crisis,\" she continued, \"we can't simply focus on creating more children. We must focus on creating more healthy marriages between married men and women.

She was not at all pleased with what had happened with this year's platform. Not only are the Republicans trying to pretend that they aren't 100% anti-abortion, but they aren't even allowing their own people to bring it up behind closed doors. She was not alone in her displeasure:\n\nThe platform, released after a closed meeting of Republican National Committee party officials Monday in Milwaukee's Baird Center, promotes nationalism, is less socially conservative on the issue of abortion access, and promotes new voting restrictions at a time when the GOP is pushing a conflicting message to their party faithful.\n\nThe way the platform was crafted and approved angered some committee members focused on pursuing a more aggressive policy on abortion access, who told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel debate was discouraged more than had been the case in previous platform draftings.\n\n\"Normally, people fly in and they're working for two or three days on the platform, and it's great. This time, it was a very controlled thing. And sadly, there was no opportunity for the actual delegates to impact the platform,\" Kris Ullman, president of anti-abortion advocacy group Eagle Forum in Washington, D.C., said.\n\nUllman said, \"Any mention of the unborn was removed from the platform.\"\n\nGayle Ruzicka, an RNC platform committee member from Utah, said officials squashed debate on the abortion item.\n\n\"They didn't allow any amendments. They didn't allow any discussion. They rolled us,\" Ruzicka said. \"We only spent thousands of dollars to be here, and what they told us they were going to do isn't what happened. None of it happened. I've never seen this happen before. I don't understand why they did it, and I'm extremely disappointed that we do not have any pro-life language.\"\n\nThe platform that was given to the committee members was written by Trump and his advisors and distributed earlier this month as talking points. The committee members were there just to rubber stamp it, which they willingly did do, despite their bleating.\n\nThose talking points and the subsequent ones come straight from Project 2025 and Agenda 47, which is quite clear that their Christofascist agenda includes a national abortion ban but also a ban on contraceptive medication and even IVF. For Trump and the T-RNC to continue to deny these facts is simply an insult to our intelligence. Then again, Trump's MAGA zombies don't have an intelligence to insult, which is why he's gotten away with it this far. The Trumpanzees are just trying to keep the whole abortion issue in the dark because they know that it would be the end of them if people started paying attention to it again.\n\nWhat the T-RNC is being honest about in their platform includes attacking workers, attacking voter rights, and waging war on the disabled and the elderly. Going after brown and black-skinned people, dismantling the judicial system, and returning to anti-environmental standards.\n\nWhen you objectively examine their platform, what's there not to hate?", "source": {"uri": "crooksandliars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crooks and Liars"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_capper_liebenthal@crooksandliars.com", "name": "Chris Capper Liebenthal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISN-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WISN-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eagle Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Journal_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://crooksandliars.com/files/primary_image/24/07/screenshot_2024-07-08_152954.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716769", "eventUri": "eng-9716769", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Gov. Accuses Biden of Politicizing Hurricane Beryl Response Leah Barkoukis\n\nThere is a new challenge for pro-life voters as we approach the 2024 elections. On the one hand, in my opinion, it is impossible for a truly pro-life voter to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate given the radical, pro-abortion stance of that party. That holds true as well for the positions of President Biden and Vice President Harris, which continue to lurch further to the left. But now that the RNC has embraced the watered down platform crafted by the Trump team, do we simply acquiesce and vote Republican? Do we refuse to cast our vote and insist on our righteous standards? Or is there another way?\n\nFor those not familiar with the ongoing debate, since 1984, the GOP has contained language supporting an \"amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to children before birth.\" Its pro-life plank has been extensive and strong.\n\nIn contrast, not one of the 20 promises listed in the new party platform mentions abortion, while the paragraph discussing abortion in the new platform simply says \"We proudly stand for families and life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process, and that the states are therefore free to pass laws protecting those rights. After 51 years because of us, that power has been given to the state and to a vote of the people. We will oppose late term abortion while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF.\"\n\nSenator Marsh Blackburn, wanting to reassure pro-life GOP voters, said, \"The Republican Party is a pro-life party. It's a pro-family party. It is always going to be that.\"\n\nMany will surely say in reply, \"Seriously? That is supposed to be a pro-life statement?\"\n\nFirst, if the baby in the womb is a person and \"no person can be denied life or liberty without due process,\" then the states are not \"free to pass laws protecting those rights\" they are duty-bound to pass those laws. And why doesn't the new platform assert that the baby in the womb is a person?\n\nSecond, if the issue on the table had been slavery, would we celebrate a platform that boasted that now, each state could vote on the legality of slavery? Hardly. We would say that slavery needed to be outlawed, plain and simple.\n\nHow, then, is this a \"pro-life\" platform? (On a lesser note, since IVF is such a hot-button, controversial issue, even within the GOP, why emphasize it in the statement?)\n\nFor good reason, a July 9 Newsweek article was titled, \"Donald Trump's Abortion Stance Sparks Republican Fury.\"\n\nDuring the presidential debate, Trump emphasized clearly that in his mind, abortion was a state issue, not a federal issue, because of which he would not sign into law a federal abortion ban if elected. He also emphasized that this was something the people got to vote on state by state, and that, in his mind, was the right venue for passing laws regarding abortion.\n\nAs for his own position, he continued to emphasize his opposition to late-term abortion as well as restating that he believed in the three exceptions of rape, incest, and the life of the mother.\n\nIs this simply pragmatism on the former president's part, knowing how volatile the issue of abortion has become in the aftermath of the overturning of Roe? Is Trump simply hedging his bets, stressing what the vast majority of Americans believe - namely, that late-term abortion is wrong - while also recognizing that pro-abortion voters apparently pushed the 2022 midterms in the direction of the Democrats?\n\nOnly Trump and his closest advisers know. (And of course, God knows.) We can only speculate.\n\nBut what we do know is that the pro-life language of the GOP platform has been greatly softened, meaning that it can hardly be viewed as \"the party of life.\" To the contrary, it is the party which is less open to abortion.\n\nWhat, then, are the choices for pro-life voters?\n\nIt does not appear that RFK would be any stronger on this issue, while a vote for any third-party, pro-life candidate would be wasted in terms of actually electing a pro-life leader. In that regard, it would be more of a statement, a protest vote, than anything else.\n\nWhat about simply accepting the current realities and voting GOP? At least that would leave things in the hands of the states - and thereby, in the hands of the voters - without running the risk of a Democratic candidate reversing the progress that has been made in recent years and trying to reestablish Roe. It would eliminate the possibility of a Democratic president appointing radical, leftist judges to our federal courts and, ultimately, to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn the other hand, by allowing the platform to be weakened in the name of electoral pragmatism, that might signal a whole new wave of GOP candidates who are less committed to the pro-life cause but who are allegedly better than the Democrats. It might also embolden current GOP congressmen to soften their own stances in the name of electability, thereby continuing to erode the GOP's stance for life. In the end, there might be little to distinguish the two parties when it comes to abortion.\n\nMy counsel would be that we do not take this new platform lying down but do our best to work for a change until the last minute possible. If, in the end, we cannot bring about change, then we still work with the GOP for the moment while making it clear behind the scenes that the next GOP candidate will have to embrace our pro-life position, otherwise, they will not make it through the primaries.\n\nThat's a battle we cannot fight now, since Trump is clearly the GOP standard bearer. But it's a battle we must fight in the future.\n\nThat being said, there's a silver lining to all this. As I wrote in Turn the Tide, we must work relentlessly on changing hearts as well as changing laws, and now that Trump has made clear that he is not a pro-life champion, we cannot make the mistake of looking to him to do what only the church can do.\n\nSo, we vote our conscience one day in November, but we spend 365 days a year being salt and light.\n\nWith that mentality, and with God's help, we can become much more of a pro-life nation.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_brown@townhall.com", "name": "Michael Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_values", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family values"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pragmatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_termination_of_pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Late termination of pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nDonald Trump, as a second-term president, would likely sign a national ban on abortion and appoint more judges who think a zygote has more rights than an adult woman. But Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, does not want any pro-choice independents to know that.\n\nSo, then, we have the 2024 Republican Party platform. Unveiled Monday, it was greeted by headlines from CNN to NBC News noting its \"softening\" stance on terminating a pregnancy. Manufactured by a platform committee that excluded a pair of \"hardline anti-abortion delegates\" at the Trump campaign's behest, it does indeed stop short of demanding that \"The Handmaid's Tale\" be made real -- at least at the federal level, at least for now.\n\nThe purported moderation reads like it was crafted to provide swing voters just enough cover to rationalize a vote for Trump.\n\n\"We will oppose Late Term Abortion,\" the document states (the vast majority of such abortions are carried out when doctors discover a severe abnormality or threat to the mother's life), \"while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF.\"\n\nAt the same time, it provides license to other Republicans, at the state level, to forget about that focus group-tested moderation, albeit in language that only makes sense to anti-abortion campaigners. \"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process,\" it says, \"and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.\"\n\nWhat that means is that Republican-led states, most of which now have draconian limits on reproductive freedom, are free to define life as beginning the moment a sperm finds an egg. That would make an abortion legally tantamount to homicide and it is the same reasoning that led Alabama's Supreme Court to rule that in vitro fertilization, which inevitably entails the destruction of some embryos, was effectively mass murder.\n\nAs feminist writer Jessica Valenti notes, the platform contains \"a clear contradiction,\" omitting talk of a national abortion ban even as it says an amendment to the U.S. Constitution is grounds for total prohibition of anything having to do with a fertilized egg.\n\n\"The RNC draft platform does not 'moderate' on abortion,\" wrote Liz Sepper, a law professor at the University of Texas. \"It commits to constitutional personhood for fetuses. It takes the view that it is not a mere statute but rather the constitution that bans abortion nationwide.\"\n\nAs for increasing access to birth control: No one, least of all a member of a GOP platform committee, actually thinks the Republican Party will do anything to promote the use of condoms or other forms of contraception. The Heritage Foundation, the hard-right think tank that authored the Project 2025 blueprint for an authoritarian second Trump term, is instead talking about \"ending recreational sex\" and the \"senseless use of birth control pills\" (and at the state level, Republicans are already going after IUDs).\n\nThe Republican platform exists to get the party through the next four months; to provide the Trump campaign a thin veneer of centrism, and potentially a few more votes, even as it signals to the base that the 2022 Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade and the national right to choose is just the start. But don't take the liberal media's word for that: It's what the base is saying too.\n\n\"The platform allows us to provide [a] winning message,\" Marjorie Dannenfelse, head of Susan B.

But Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, does not want any pro-choice independents to know that.\n\nSo, then, we have the 2024 Republican Party platform. Unveiled Monday, it was greeted by headlines from CNN to NBC News noting its \"softening\" stance on terminating a pregnancy. Manufactured by a platform committee that excluded a pair of \"hardline anti-abortion delegates\" at the Trump campaign's behest, it does indeed stop short of demanding that \"The Handmaid's Tale\" be made real -- at least at the federal level, at least for now.\n\nThe purported moderation reads like it was crafted to provide swing voters just enough cover to rationalize a vote for Trump.\n\n\"We will oppose Late Term Abortion,\" the document states (the vast majority of such abortions are carried out when doctors discover a severe abnormality or threat to the mother's life), \"while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF.\"\n\nAt the same time, it provides license to other Republicans, at the state level, to forget about that focus group-tested moderation, albeit in language that only makes sense to anti-abortion campaigners. \"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process,\" it says, \"and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.\"\n\nWhat that means is that Republican-led states, most of which now have draconian limits on reproductive freedom, are free to define life as beginning the moment a sperm finds an egg. That would make an abortion legally tantamount to homicide and it is the same reasoning that led Alabama's Supreme Court to rule that in vitro fertilization, which inevitably entails the destruction of some embryos, was effectively mass murder.\n\nAs feminist writer Jessica Valenti notes, the platform contains \"a clear contradiction,\" omitting talk of a national abortion ban even as it says an amendment to the U.S. Constitution is grounds for total prohibition of anything having to do with a fertilized egg.\n\n\"The RNC draft platform does not 'moderate' on abortion,\" wrote Liz Sepper, a law professor at the University of Texas. \"It commits to constitutional personhood for fetuses. It takes the view that it is not a mere statute but rather the constitution that bans abortion nationwide.\"\n\nAs for increasing access to birth control: No one, least of all a member of a GOP platform committee, actually thinks the Republican Party will do anything to promote the use of condoms or other forms of contraception. The Heritage Foundation, the hard-right think tank that authored the Project 2025 blueprint for an authoritarian second Trump term, is instead talking about \"ending recreational sex\" and the \"senseless use of birth control pills\" (and at the state level, Republicans are already going after IUDs).\n\nThe Republican platform exists to get the party through the next four months; to provide the Trump campaign a thin veneer of centrism, and potentially a few more votes, even as it signals to the base that the 2022 Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade and the national right to choose is just the start. But don't take the liberal media's word for that: It's what the base is saying too.\n\n\"The platform allows us to provide [a] winning message,\" Marjorie Dannenfelse, head of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement, referencing the group's efforts to reach voters in swing states. \"The Republican Party remains strongly pro-life at the national level.\"\n\nLisa Rubin, a legal analyst at MSNBC, observed that the new GOP platform \"is like a Rorschach test,\" suggesting newfound moderation to some and a doubling down on anti-choice extremism to others.

The last time the GOP revised its platform was in 2016. Those 66 pages of policy proposals have now been replaced by a new platform that is just 16 pages long. There are a couple of significant moves away from previous Republican Party positions, and these policy shifts demonstrate that the 45th president - and perhaps soon-to-be 47th - is firmly in control.\n\nThe RNC has long advocated for a national ban on abortion. That stance is out of line with the majority of American voters, and Republicans have been punished in recent elections because of it. Whether one supports or opposes abortion, the reality today is most Americans want women to have access to abortion services - in certain circumstances, at the very least.\n\nThe GOP's new proposed platform recognizes that, in overturning Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court sent the issue of abortion access back to the states. That is where it always belonged, which is one of the main reasons why Roe v. Wade was bad law. One could argue that removing this authority from the states once again, via a national abortion ban, would be equally bad law. Certainly, it is not an idea that would be supported by most Americans, and Trump has drawn the ire of some conservatives by making it clear that he, too, is not in favor of a federal ban.\n\nOther significant changes include the erasing of any language supporting gun rights and the removal of the Republican Party's previously stated position that marriage was between \"one man and one woman.\" These two alterations to the platform will likely also displease many conservatives.\n\nIt is entirely reasonable to suggest that, on the subject of same-sex marriage, the horse is long gone from the barn. On the other hand, the new platform is very much a statement of principles and priorities. Many would argue that even if Republicans are never seriously going to move toward a new ban on same-sex marriage, they could still at least have stated their continued support for the more traditional view.\n\nThe omission of any language supporting the Second Amendment is perhaps more troubling. The old platform Included support for constitutional carry. In today's America, it may be politically toxic to talk about abortion bans or traditional marriage, but shying away from supporting gun rights seems to smack of timidity. A significant percentage of Americans either own guns already or they are considering purchasing one. A multitude of studies - along with the sales figures and ever-growing volume of gun permit applications - bears this out. Yet, it appears the RNC has tipped its hat to the clamor from the political left for an end to the so-called \"gun violence epidemic.\"\n\nStill, Donald Trump himself has made his pro Second Amendment stance very clear. What is not clear is whether he and the RNC had any discussion about including support for gun rights in the proposed new platform.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is touting his own framework he calls \"Agenda 47.\" It's a list of sweeping policy proposals, including ending welfare to illegal aliens, rebuilding the military, reducing the cost of American energy, and radically overhauling the education system.\n\nThe GOP establishment was never at ease with anyone who holds firm views that might threaten to upset the status quo or derail the Washington, DC gravy train. Thus, there has always been a certain amount of resistance to Donald Trump from within his own party. While there are still a few congressional Republicans who are not totally comfortable with the former president, the beginning of the end for the somewhat Trump-averse establishment may have begun after the 2022 midterms. Trump was out of power, and Republicans were going it alone. They failed - some would say quite spectacularly. A much-anticipated red wave turned out to be barely a ripple. The party seemed a little lost without Trump, and, since then, it has tacked gradually toward him - until now, a time when he seems very much in control of the Grand Old Party, while the Old Guard fades into the background.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graham_j_noble@libertynation.com", "name": "Graham J Noble", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

This shift, announced by former President Donald Trump, predictably, has sparked a mix of reactions within the party and among its supporters.\n\nThe new platform, approved by the RNC panel, reflects Trump's broader policy agenda and aims to reshape the party as he makes his third bid for the White House. The platform's language on abortion now mirrors Trump's post-Roe v. Wade stance, emphasizing that restrictions should be left to the states. This approach aligns with the Supreme Court's decision that states have the authority to protect the rights guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.\n\nNotably, the platform does not call for a national abortion ban, a position that some social conservatives had hoped to see. This omission raises questions about the party's commitment to the pro-life cause and whether it represents a strategic move by Trump to broaden his appeal or a genuine shift in policy.\n\nThe updated platform also omits the traditional definition of marriage as between \"one man and one woman.\" This change reflects a significant departure from previous Republican platforms and suggests a more inclusive approach to same-sex marriage. However, it has left some conservative supporters feeling alienated and questioning the party's adherence to traditional values.\n\nTrump has signaled that his new stance is strategic, aimed at winning re-election and securing Republican majorities in the House and Senate. He has emphasized that the platform is a forward-looking agenda with promises to be swiftly fulfilled once in office.\n\nThe question remains whether this strategy will pay off or if it risks losing the support of the party's conservative base.\n\nThe alternative to supporting Trump's pragmatic approach is continuing under President Joe Biden's administration, which many Republicans find untenable. Biden's policies over the past four years have not satisfied conservative voters, and the prospect of another term is unappealing to them. Even potential Democrat candidates like Robert Kennedy, Jr., despite his strong stance against COVID-19 vaccines, still support pro-abortion policies, making them less favorable to pro-life Republicans.\n\nIn summary, while the softened language on abortion and same-sex marriage in the new Republican platform has sparked controversy, it may be a necessary strategic move for Trump to secure victory in the upcoming election. Trusting Trump's track record and his ability to implement conservative policies once re-elected could be the best option for Republicans committed to preserving their core values.", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Some on the right have raised concerns about the Republican Party's official platform and its less rigid positions on some social issues.\n\nThe official platform, adopted this week, does not include language about same-sex marriage, long opposed by the GOP, and calls for leaving abortion up to the states rather than for a federal ban on the procedure, which has been pushed by some conservative lawmakers.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News' Brian Kilmeade on Wednesday, Trump was pressed about why his platform takes a softer stance on these issues.\n\n\"For the first time, no nationwide ban on abortion,\" Kilmeade said. \"For the first time in 40 years. IVF is OK with you. No mention of traditional marriage because, I guess...you're pulling back on that a little. It seems as though this is something that's targeting moderates. What was your approach to this platform?\"\n\nTrump responded that the platform isn't intended to target moderate voters, some of whom may still be undecided about the two presidential candidates and could determine the outcome of the race.\n\n\"Well, it's not targeting moderates. It's common sense,\" Trump said. \"They basically had, in some cases, gay bans. I don't want that. It's not what we're about. They had other things that are ridiculous. The abortion issue is much simplified right now because I brought it out by getting rid of Roe v. Wade. That was an incredible thing.\"\n\nThe former president continued touting his administration's success in the overturning of Roe, which ended the constitutional right to an abortion. He appointed three justices to the Supreme Court who were crucial to its ruling against Roe in 2022.\n\nTrump also described the overturning of Roe as a \"great service,\" adding that states' votes on the issue have been \"turning out very liberal.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out by email to Trump's campaign for comment.\n\nTrump has faced questions about how he would approach these issues if he returns to the Oval Office next year.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats have sounded the alarm about Project 2025, a 900-page document created by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, that presents policy proposals for a future GOP administration. The project advocates for the reversal of federal protections for reproductive rights and includes measures to restrict LGBTQ+ rights nationally.\n\nTrump, however, has sought to distance himself from the project, saying that he doesn't agree with all of its proposals and that some are \"absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.\" Project 2025 was created by and has received the support of many Trump supporters, and his comments have done little to quell concerns about the project.\n\nMeanwhile, some conservatives have taken issue with Trump's approach to these social issues.\n\n\"The RNC platform is a profound disappointment to the millions of pro-life Republicans that have always looked to the Republican Party to stand for life,\" former Vice President Mike Pence wrote in a post to X (formerly Twitter).", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_stanton@newsweek.com", "name": "Andrew Stanton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kilmeade", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brian Kilmeade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

But a source familiar with the planning said DeSantis won't have a spot on the convention stage during the four-day affair.\"\n\nIt's not just on the national stage next week that voters will see how Trump has attempted to stomp out any dissent.\n\nFollowing the release of the draft Republican Party platform, reportedly in part written by Donald Trump, which \"could read like a MAGA rally,\" The New York Times reported, former Trump Vice President Mike Pence denounced the document.\n\nClaiming it \"removed historic pro-life principles that have long been the foundation of the platform,\" Pence said, \"I urge delegates attending next week's Republican Convention to restore language to our party's platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.\"\n\nOther leaders among the Christian far-right, which is one of the largest portions of Trump's base, have also denounced the RNC platform because it has removed some anti-abortion language, despite it actually paving the way for \"fetal personhood.\"\n\nRELATED: 'Pledge of Allegiance' to Trump: Draft RNC Platform Spins Abortion and LGBTQ Issues\n\nIn March, Pence announced he would not support Trump's re-election bid.\n\n\"It should come as no surprise that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year,\" Pence said.\n\n\"Pence has joined a faction of conservatives decrying the updated Republican National Committee platform rubber-stamped by former President Donald Trump for its inclusion of softened language on abortion, a marked change from past cycles,\" ABC News reports. Anti-LGBTQ hate group head Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, is a member of the RNC platform committee, and in an act of defiance submitted a minority report opposing the abortion language.\n\nIt's not just GOP leaders. After the Trump-endorsed platform was pushed through the committee with little debate, one platform committee member from Utah told WISN News (video below), \"they rolled us.\"\n\n\"It's never happened before,\" Gail Ruzicka said as she shook her head. \"There was no committees, we've always had subcommittees where we can go in and work on a section of the platform.\"\n\nBut leaders \"didn't allow any amendments,\" or discussion, she lamented.\n\n\"Everything they told us they were going to do isn't what happened.\"\n\n\"I didn't vote for this,\" she said, adding, \"I've never been treated so badly, to have them force this vote on us.\"\n\nRuzicka said they were given the draft language, had time just to glance at it before a motion was made and the committee voted on it. That platform will be voted on at the convention Monday.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the choreographed process -- which allowed no amendments to be discussed or voted upon -- was unbecoming of a party that champions free speech and due process. Delegates were given the platform this morning when they entered the convention hall with no time to review, much less the 72 hours that Republican lawmakers call for in the House of Representatives.

Heading into this week, the atmosphere was already emotionally charged, especially after weeks of speculation that the Trump team was planning to hijack the process and radically revamp the 60 pages of principles the party had ratified eight years before -- all behind closed doors. \"I've been involved in this nearly 20 years,\" Family Research Council Action Chairman Tony Perkins said. And the amount of secrecy is \"unprecedented.\"\n\nUnlike past years, when the media was welcome in the proceedings, \"there's kind of this cone of silence,\" Perkins warned. Not only were the 112 delegates ordered to leave their cell phones outside the room, but none of the participants had access to the proposed platform language in advance. \"That's not the way conservatives do business,\" FRC's president insisted in an interview beforehand. \"We like sunlight. We want the American people to see what we're doing and what we have to offer. That's very concerning to me.\" The whole point of this, he argued, is to \"reflect where the conservative movement, the Republican Party is at. ... But it needs to be open. ... The American people should be able to see the deliberation, the debate that formulates the vision of the [GOP].\"\n\nAs one delegate told Politico anonymously, \"The RNC is doing this process behind closed doors because they know that the Republican grassroots would never go for this establishment RINO bull****.\"\n\nFueling the concerns, of course, were the reports that Donald Trump was trying to gut the platform's pro-family planks to avoid unnecessary \"drama.\" Those rumors, to the dismay of millions of conservatives, turned out to be true. The 16-page draft was a shell of its 2016 self in all the ways that mattered. Gone were the calls for protecting life from conception, for opposing taxpayer-funded abortion -- at home through the Hyde Amendment or abroad through the Mexico City Policy. There was no insistence on safeguarding children from gender-mutilating surgery, no support for adoption, no demand for a federal role in limiting abortion.\n\nInstead, the 2024 document states simply: \"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the states and to a vote of the people. We will oppose late term abortion while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nThe version concocted by RNC leaders and Trump slashed the pro-life language from more than 1,300 words in 2020 to a paltry 90, telling Americans everything they need to know about its priority (or lack thereof) in this party.\n\nOn \"Washington Watch\" Monday evening, Perkins was frank about the outcome and the locked-down process. \"You win some and you lose some, and unfortunately, the unborn did not necessarily win [today].\" Is it a bad document? No, he explained to guest host and former Congressman Jody Hice. \"It's a fairly decent statement of a campaign's priorities, but not the enduring principles of a party.\" After all, Perkins reminded everyone, these are meant to be guiding documents. They \"aren't insignificant,\" he reiterated, pointing to the research that shows Republicans vote with their platform 87% of the time.\n\n\"This is a political party prone to taking the wrong direction,\" Perkins recognized. \"It's discouraging from that standpoint of all of the work for decades that has brought this party to the place of championing the unborn.\"\n\nAccording to FRCA's chairman, who represented Louisiana on the committee, \"Delegates were only given a few minutes of discussion before 'debate' was ended and a vote was taken. Ironically, the document calls for a vigorous defense of free speech and the end of government censorship. Deprived of the opportunity to discuss amendments to the draft platform document, we have submitted a minority report to supplement that campaign's platform.\"\n\nOn one of the biggest debates of the day -- transgenderism -- the delegates approved a document that includes no public endorsement of the states' SAFE Acts but did explicitly highlight the urgency of restoring parental rights in education. \"We trust parents!\" it reads. \"We will keep men out of women's sports, ban taxpayer funding for sex change surgeries, and stop taxpayer-funded schools from promoting gender transition, reverse Biden's radical rewrite of Title IX education regulations, and restore protections for women and girls,\" the new platform promises.\n\nIn a departure from the 2016/2020 version, marriage was mentioned but conveniently undefined -- sidestepping another social value that conservatives continue to care deeply about. \"Republicans will promote a Culture that values the Sanctity of Marriage.\"\n\nThe abbreviated document, which reads like something straight out of a Donald Trump fundraising email, flows from 20 overarching principles that the campaign released early Monday afternoon -- none of which mention the protection of human life. That won't sit well with GOP voters, 66% of whom think that Republicans should keep (32%) or strengthen (34%) the party's current platform position on the unborn.\n\nOf course, these concessions seemed almost inevitable after Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who many consider a frontrunner for the VP slot, very publicly caved on the issue in a devastating interview with CNN's Dana Bash. In a shocking betrayal of his longtime beliefs, he was asked whether the platform should abandon its strong defense of the unborn. \"I think our platform has to reflect our nominee,\" the Floridian said flatly. On the contrary, The Washington Stand's Ben Johnson fired back, \"the Republican Party platform should reflect the values of its voters and their enduring political positions. That's what grassroots means.\"\n\n\"Even if we wanted to,\" Rubio persisted, \"you couldn't pass\" an amendment protecting life from conception, he argued. Bash pressed him on whether he was fearful that leaving that language out of the platform would dampen enthusiasm. \"Not really,\" Rubio replied nonchalantly. \"There's only one pro-life candidate in this race,\" Rubio said, sounding more and more like a VP wannabe, \"and it's Donald Trump. And I think his position on this has been ... reality, which is you can't pass a federal law now even if we wanted to.\"\n\nStunned by Rubio's abandonment of more than 20 years of political advocacy, pro-life leaders took to X to vent their frustrations. Perkins was astonished by what he called the Florida senator's \"capitulation to the forces of abortion.\" \"First, a human life amendment has never been within political reach,\" he pointed out, \"it has always been aspirational and so it should remain. I can assure you that if the GOP abandons the unborn in the Party Platform, it will dampen Bible-believing, conservative voter enthusiasm and turnout.\"\n\nIn Rubio's home state, local GOP officials were just as horrified. \"I can't think of a time when I've been more disappointed in an elected official than I am with Marco Rubio,\" David Biddle, the Republican Chair of Gilchrist tweeted. \"The Marco I know is unabashedly pro-life, said we would be judged as the most barbaric people in history for what we have done to the unborn. Now this.\"\n\nRubio's desertion of pro-lifers comes as many of his colleagues urged delegates to hold the line on the GOP platform. \"Any effort to weaken the Republican Party's commitment to life and marriage would be a mistake,\" Missouri Senator Josh Hawley (R) cautioned Monday.\n\nOklahoma Senator James Lankford (R) was equally passionate, telling a Students for Life webcast, \"There are Republicans right now saying this is only a states' issue, we shouldn't talk about it on the federal side. When I talk to several of those Republicans, I think their core issue is: 'Why are we fighting this on a national level? We don't have the votes to win it. We don't have 60 votes in the Senate, the majority we need to win this big of a vote in the House to change things, so let's not discuss it all.'\"\n\nThat's not the point, Lankford wanted people to know. \"... I am keenly aware we don't have the votes in the Senate. But the worst thing we can do is not talk about it [at] all and somehow make people presume that ... we don't care about children anymore. We do care passionately about children. The way you win the argument is to keep talking about it, not talk about it less.\"\n\nEven Trump's allies, like Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), pushed back on this idea that abortion is somehow a states' rights issue now. \"If we change our platform and we buy into the narrative [that] being pro-life is bad politics ... we're going to be net losers, because the people who believe like we do are going to abandon us because we've abandoned what makes us different.\" Presidential candidates come and go, he pointed out -- but the platform \"is foundational.\"\n\nOthers from the former president's cabinet, Mike Pompeo and Ben Carson, have sounded the alarm on watering down the GOP's principles. \"I think it's a mistake,\" the former secretary of State shook his head. \"It will be difficult to get federal legislative limits,\" he admitted, but that doesn't mean we abandon that fight.\n\nAs Perkins emphasized in a conversation with pro-life leader Chuck Donovan, whose expertise spans five decades, including the Reagan administration, this isn't about politics. \"If there is a moral absolute,\" that we are in fact \"endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights\" like life, \"if that's an absolute, it doesn't stop at the state line. ... This is something that is universal.\" Calling it a states' issue, as this version of the platform does, is \"basically the same argument that the party had with the nation in 1856 over slavery and polygamy.\" You can't relegate life to the states, Donovan insists, because there's \"a bundle of federal legislation in existence that protects unborn children from being attacked.\"\n\n\"We have the Child Health Insurance Program, which specifically says the states may design programs that properly treat the unborn child as a beneficiary of those programs -- not a target. We have the Medicaid program, whatever you think of it, it's a federal-state partnership. And as of today, 42% of the births in the United States are to Medicaid eligible mothers. So it matters supremely whether the baby is a beneficiary of that program or a target of it.\" There's the military, he continues, \"that's federal jurisdiction. What do we do with military hospitals? We have the VA now being pushed by Joe Biden to provide abortion or refer for abortion. You have the District of Columbia, which allows abortions up to birth. ... And if Congress doesn't deal with it, then right there in our nation's capital, a few blocks from the halls that honor Jefferson and Lincoln, we will have babies near term being killed. It's unacceptable. \"\n\nAnd then there's the Wild West of the abortion pill that makes undermining state laws even easier, Chuck points out. \"You may not have abortion permissible in your state, but ... thanks to our Food and Drug Administration, they can mail your 13-year-old daughter abortion pills. She didn't even have to be pregnant. They can send them along and encourage her to use them if she needs them. They can encourage minors to be brought across state lines. They oppose limits that respect the rights of parents. So it matters to Rhode Island what happens in New York State,\" he underscored. \"It matters to Texas, what's permitted in Kansas. And essentially it comes back, though, to the question, is the protection of life a universal principle? And what happens when we walk away from that?\"\n\nAt the end of the day, this is one of those areas of clear contrast between the Republican and Democratic Parties, FRC's president emphasized. The GOP has become the party of life with \"the Democratic Party becoming ... literally [the party of] abortion until the moment of birth [with taxpayer funding].\"\n\n\"We have a chance, post-Dobbs, to protect the unborn,\" Donovan wanted people to know. \"But I have to tell you, we're not going to get there by retreat. The Republican Party, if it abandons almost 50 years of pro-life commitment, I think it's dooming the nation in some ways; it's certainly dooming itself.\"\n\nAs for Perkins, who left the committee vote Monday morning frustrated and disappointed at the RNC's missed opportunities on life, he's not giving up the fight. \"Look, I'm going to continue to champion the unborn,\" he reiterated. \"Number one, we have to redouble our efforts as it pertains to standing for human life -- supporting mothers in crisis pregnancies, adopting children, promoting these policies at the state level -- but still advocating and pointing out that this idea that this is just a states' issue is logically flawed, [as] we've seen with the abortion pill [comprising] 70% of all abortions.\"\n\n\"We need to continue to pray,\" he urged. \"We need to continue to vote, and we need to continue to stand.\"\n\nAsked what kind of impact this might have, Perkins was honest. \"I can only say that, unfortunately, I think it dampens enthusiasm. ... To what degree, I don't know -- but the elections are so close we can't afford any deviation.\" As for the party's critics who accuse him of being too tough on Trump, Tony said earnestly, \"That's not my intention. I was trying to help him. ... But I cannot compromise biblical truth to advance a temporal political objective. I won't do it,\" he insisted. \"I just can't do it.\"", "source": {"uri": "patriotpost.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Patriot Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

To wit: It took the unmasking of his successor as a befuddled geriatric to move the needle substantively among independents in this fall's election.\n\nThis week, Republicans rushed to adopt their 2024 platform ahead of this month's quadrennial convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. At Trump's urging, language contained in the platform regarding GOP opposition to abortion has been \"softened,\" \"shifted\" - or altogether removed.\n\nDiverging from previous platforms - which advocated for a national abortion ban and affirmatively posited that \"the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed\" - the new document leaves the issue of abortion entirely up to individual states.\n\nAnd removes the \"fundamental right to life\" language altogether ...\n\nThe only opposition to the practice expressly envisaged at the federal level by this platform? A ban on \"late term abortion.\"\n\n\"We believe that the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process, and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights,\" the platform stated.\n\nPontius Pilate would be proud of such hand-scrubbing ...\n\n\"After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the states and to a vote of the people,\" the platform continued.\n\nThat's a reference to the decisive role Trump's supreme court appointees played in overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling which created a de facto federal right to abortion.\n\nTrump's pivot on this issue is no surprise. Earlier this year, he blasted U.S. senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina for reintroducing a federal abortion ban - going so far as to blame himself for keeping Graham in office.\n\n\"Many Good Republicans lost elections because of this issue, and people like Lindsey Graham, that are unrelenting, are handing Democrats their dream of the House, Senate, and perhaps even the presidency,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social account.\n\nTrump's kabuki dance on abortion is naked political calculation. His pollsters have obviously done the math and determined the GOP is far more likely to gain ground this fall by softening its opposition to the practice than it would lose ground by remaining recalcitrant.\n\nBasically, they are betting hardcore pro-lifers will swallow this shift ... and early indicators are that's a safe bet.\n\n\"In contrast to what the Democratic Party offers to women and their pre-born children, the Republican Party platform offers life and hope,\" stated Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life. \"The Democratic Party is the party of unlimited abortion -- even abortions late in pregnancy.\"\n\nTobias' group added that \"contrary to the Biden administration and the Democratic Party, President Trump throughout his presidency championed policies designed to safeguard the lives of both unborn children and their mothers from unlimited abortions.\"\n\nNot everyone was thrilled with the move, though.\n\n\"The idea that all human life from conception until natural death deserves protection has become nearly foreign to the party proper,\" noted Laura Beth Kirsop, a pro-life political operative from the South Carolina Upstate. \"The updated language demonstrates that, within the Republican Party, abortion is primarily an issue to be used and abused for politicized and pragmatic reasons: to garner conservative votes or to persuade less conservative constituents to palatable moderation or compromise. While I fully believe that there is a time for open discussion on the best means to saving the most life with the resources we have, the writing of the party platform, to which we hold our leaders accountable, is not that time. It ought to be an uncompromising document -- especially on life or death issues for our most vulnerable. This new language is greatly disappointing.\"\n\nGOP stalwarts were also miffed by the process which led to the sudden policy shift.\n\n\"The document -- which was whittled down from 66 pages in 2016 to 16 pages this year -- was developed behind closed doors and hastily presented to and approved by delegates in just a few hours Monday morning,\" Megan Messerly and Irie Sentner reported for Politico.\n\nAccording to Messerly and Sentner, one GOP delegate told them party leaders \"didn't even give us a chance to read it before we voted on it.\"\n\nHmmm ...\n\nI've made my personal position on the abortion issue abundantly clear over the years. I believe life to be the \"indispensable liberty\" and have long argued if we cannot protect it, then \"none of the other rights really matter that much.\" Having said that, I acknowledge the political utility of Trump's retreat - although I believe he is deluding himself if he believes it will lessen either the ferocity or effectiveness of the left's attacks on him.\n\nI'd also love to have someone explain to me the cognitive dissonance of South Carolina GOP primary voters expelling three female senators for their retreat on abortion - but giving Trump a hall pass on the issue.\n\nAnyway, irrespective of my personal beliefs - or my best political analysis of the issue - FITSNews remains committed to covering abortion fairly, especially at the state level where the issue is being decided.\n\nAnd certainly this media outlet's open microphone is available to all perspectives ... pro-life, pro-choice and all points in between.\n\nWill Folks is the founding editor of the news outlet you are currently reading.

The RNC is set to begin next Monday, July 15, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a crucial swing state in the 2024 election, where Republican delegates are expected to nominate Trump as their official presidential nominee.\n\nThe convention comes as Trump continues to hold a lead in key swing states, while Democrats publicly question whether President Joe Biden, who won most delegates in the Democratic primary, should remain their nominee amid concerns about his age. Despite positive developments for the Trump campaign, he is still facing anger from many conservatives the week before the convention amid backlash over the Republican Party platform and speaker lineup at the convention. Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign for comment via email.\n\nSome conservatives have expressed outrage over the party's platform with regards to its language on abortion, set to be a potentially decisive issue in November. The platform, which was drafted by Trump and his team, does not include calls for a federal abortion ban, instead saying the issue should be left to the states.\n\nThe position is largely in line with what Trump has said publicly as abortion has become a sore spot from Republicans, who faced electoral losses after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the case that for decades guaranteed abortion rights nationwide, in 2022.\n\nRead more: https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-faces-angry-republicans-convention-1923463", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The Washington Post called it \"a bruising primary season.\"\n\nHe did.\n\nAt the 2008 convention, Hillary Clinton released her delegates and formally nominated Barack Obama to be the party's nominee, saying, \"let's declare all together with one voice right here and right now that Barack Obama is our candidate and he will be our president.\"\n\nAt the 2016 convention Hillary Clinton delivered a speech designed to unite the party, telling Sanders supporters, \"I've heard you. Your cause is our cause.\"\n\nNothing like that will happen next week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, because those who opposed the party's presumptive nominee have not been invited to speak. Donald Trump has made no attempt to unite the party by embracing his critics within the party - and now he will exclude them.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Wildly Irresponsible': NY Times Blasted Over Debunked Parkinson's Doctor 'Innuendo'\n\nAs \"Republicans happily watch Democratic turmoil over Biden\" after the President's poor debate performance nearly two weeks ago, the GOP has many internal battles of its own that threaten party unity.\n\nNikki Haley, Donald Trump's former UN Ambassador, was the last candidate opposing him to drop out.

But a source familiar with the planning said DeSantis won't have a spot on the convention stage during the four-day affair.\"\n\nIt's not just on the national stage next week that voters will see how Trump has attempted to stomp out any dissent.\n\nFollowing the release of the draft Republican Party platform, reportedly in part written by Donald Trump, which \"could read like a MAGA rally,\" The New York Times reported, former Trump Vice President Mike Pence denounced the document.\n\nClaiming it \"removed historic pro-life principles that have long been the foundation of the platform,\" Pence said, \"I urge delegates attending next week's Republican Convention to restore language to our party's platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.\"\n\nOther leaders among the Christian far-right, which is one of the largest portions of Trump's base, have also denounced the RNC platform because it has removed some anti-abortion language, despite it actually paving the way for \"fetal personhood.\"\n\nRELATED: 'Pledge of Allegiance' to Trump: Draft RNC Platform Spins Abortion and LGBTQ Issues\n\nIn March, Pence announced he would not support Trump's re-election bid.\n\n\"It should come as no surprise that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year,\" Pence said.\n\n\"Pence has joined a faction of conservatives decrying the updated Republican National Committee platform rubber-stamped by former President Donald Trump for its inclusion of softened language on abortion, a marked change from past cycles,\" ABC News reports. Anti-LGBTQ hate group head Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, is a member of the RNC platform committee, and in an act of defiance submitted a minority report opposing the abortion language.\n\nIt's not just GOP leaders. After the Trump-endorsed platform was pushed through the committee with little debate, one platform committee member from Utah told WISN News (video below), \"they rolled us.\"\n\n\"It's never happened before,\" Gail Ruzicka said as she shook her head. \"There was no committees, we've always had subcommittees where we can go in and work on a section of the platform.\"\n\nBut leaders \"didn't allow any amendments,\" or discussion, she lamented.\n\n\"Everything they told us they were going to do isn't what happened.\"\n\n\"I didn't vote for this,\" she said, adding, \"I've never been treated so badly, to have them force this vote on us.\"\n\nRuzicka said they were given the draft language, had time just to glance at it before a motion was made and the committee voted on it. That platform will be voted on at the convention Monday.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the choreographed process -- which allowed no amendments to be discussed or voted upon -- was unbecoming of a party that champions free speech and due process. Delegates were given the platform this morning when they entered the convention hall with no time to review, much less the 72 hours that Republican lawmakers call for in the House of Representatives. Delegates were only given a few minutes of discussion before 'debate' was ended and a vote was taken.\"\n\nAnd on Capitol Hill, Trump's impact is imploding the far-right House Freedom Caucus.\n\n\"The House Freedom Caucus Monday night voted to eject Rep.

Heading into this week, the atmosphere was already emotionally charged, especially after weeks of speculation that the Trump team was planning to hijack the process and radically revamp the 60 pages of principles the party had ratified eight years before -- all behind closed doors. \"I've been involved in this nearly 20 years,\" Family Research Council Action Chairman Tony Perkins said. And the amount of secrecy is \"unprecedented.\"\n\nUnlike past years, when the media was welcome in the proceedings, \"there's kind of this cone of silence,\" Perkins warned. Not only were the 112 delegates ordered to leave their cell phones outside the room, but none of the participants had access to the proposed platform language in advance. \"That's not the way conservatives do business,\" FRC's president insisted in an interview beforehand. \"We like sunlight. We want the American people to see what we're doing and what we have to offer. That's very concerning to me.\" The whole point of this, he argued, is to \"reflect where the conservative movement, the Republican Party is at. ... But it needs to be open. ... The American people should be able to see the deliberation, the debate that formulates the vision of the [GOP].\"\n\nAs one delegate told Politico anonymously, \"The RNC is doing this process behind closed doors because they know that the Republican grassroots would never go for this establishment RINO bull****.\"\n\nPlease follow LifeNews.com on Gab for the latest pro-life news and info, free from social media censorship.\n\nFueling the concerns, of course, were the reports that Donald Trump was trying to gut the platform's pro-family planks to avoid unnecessary \"drama.\" Those rumors, to the dismay of millions of conservatives, turned out to be true. The 16-page draft was a shell of its 2016 self in all the ways that mattered. Gone were the calls for protecting life from conception, for opposing taxpayer-funded abortion -- at home through the Hyde Amendment or abroad through the Mexico City Policy. There was no insistence on safeguarding children from gender-mutilating surgery, no support for adoption, no demand for a federal role in limiting abortion.\n\nInstead, the 2024 document states simply: \"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the states and to a vote of the people. We will oppose late term abortion while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nThe version concocted by RNC leaders and Trump slashed the pro-life language from more than 1,300 words in 2020 to a paltry 90, telling Americans everything they need to know about its priority (or lack thereof) in this party.\n\nOn \"Washington Watch\" Monday evening, Perkins was frank about the outcome and the locked-down process. \"You win some and you lose some, and unfortunately, the unborn did not necessarily win [today].\" Is it a bad document? No, he explained to guest host and former Congressman Jody Hice. \"It's a fairly decent statement of a campaign's priorities, but not the enduring principles of a party.\" After all, Perkins reminded everyone, these are meant to be guiding documents. They \"aren't insignificant,\" he reiterated, pointing to the research that shows Republicans vote with their platform 87% of the time.\n\n\"This is a political party prone to taking the wrong direction,\" Perkins recognized. \"It's discouraging from that standpoint of all of the work for decades that has brought this party to the place of championing the unborn.\"\n\nAccording to FRCA's chairman, who represented Louisiana on the committee, \"Delegates were only given a few minutes of discussion before 'debate' was ended and a vote was taken. Ironically, the document calls for a vigorous defense of free speech and the end of government censorship. Deprived of the opportunity to discuss amendments to the draft platform document, we have submitted a minority report to supplement that campaign's platform.\"\n\nOn one of the biggest debates of the day -- transgenderism -- the delegates approved a document that includes no public endorsement of the states' SAFE Acts but did explicitly highlight the urgency of restoring parental rights in education. \"We trust parents!\" it reads. \"We will keep men out of women's sports, ban taxpayer funding for sex change surgeries, and stop taxpayer-funded schools from promoting gender transition, reverse Biden's radical rewrite of Title IX education regulations, and restore protections for women and girls,\" the new platform promises.\n\nIn a departure from the 2016/2020 version, marriage was mentioned but conveniently undefined -- sidestepping another social value that conservatives continue to care deeply about. \"Republicans will promote a Culture that values the Sanctity of Marriage.\"\n\nThe abbreviated document, which reads like something straight out of a Donald Trump fundraising email, flows from 20 overarching principles that the campaign released early Monday afternoon -- none of which mention the protection of human life. That won't sit well with GOP voters, 66% of whom think that Republicans should keep (32%) or strengthen (34%) the party's current platform position on the unborn.\n\nOf course, these concessions seemed almost inevitable after Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who many consider a frontrunner for the VP slot, very publicly caved on the issue in a devastating interview with CNN's Dana Bash. In a shocking betrayal of his longtime beliefs, he was asked whether the platform should abandon its strong defense of the unborn. \"I think our platform has to reflect our nominee,\" the Floridian said flatly. On the contrary, The Washington Stand's Ben Johnson fired back, \"the Republican Party platform should reflect the values of its voters and their enduring political positions. That's what grassroots means.\"\n\n\"Even if we wanted to,\" Rubio persisted, \"you couldn't pass\" an amendment protecting life from conception, he argued. Bash pressed him on whether he was fearful that leaving that language out of the platform would dampen enthusiasm. \"Not really,\" Rubio replied nonchalantly. \"There's only one pro-life candidate in this race,\" Rubio said, sounding more and more like a VP wannabe, \"and it's Donald Trump. And I think his position on this has been ... reality, which is you can't pass a federal law now even if we wanted to.\"\n\nStunned by Rubio's abandonment of more than 20 years of political advocacy, pro-life leaders took to X to vent their frustrations. Perkins was astonished by what he called the Florida senator's \"capitulation to the forces of abortion.\" \"First, a human life amendment has never been within political reach,\" he pointed out, \"it has always been aspirational and so it should remain. I can assure you that if the GOP abandons the unborn in the Party Platform, it will dampen Bible-believing, conservative voter enthusiasm and turnout.\"\n\nIn Rubio's home state, local GOP officials were just as horrified. \"I can't think of a time when I've been more disappointed in an elected official than I am with Marco Rubio,\" David Biddle, the Republican Chair of Gilchrist tweeted. \"The Marco I know is unabashedly pro-life, said we would be judged as the most barbaric people in history for what we have done to the unborn. Now this.\"\n\nRubio's desertion of pro-lifers comes as many of his colleagues urged delegates to hold the line on the GOP platform. \"Any effort to weaken the Republican Party's commitment to life and marriage would be a mistake,\" Missouri Senator Josh Hawley (R) cautioned Monday.\n\nOklahoma Senator James Lankford (R) was equally passionate, telling a Students for Life webcast, \"There are Republicans right now saying this is only a states' issue, we shouldn't talk about it on the federal side. When I talk to several of those Republicans, I think their core issue is: 'Why are we fighting this on a national level? We don't have the votes to win it. We don't have 60 votes in the Senate, the majority we need to win this big of a vote in the House to change things, so let's not discuss it all.'\"\n\nThat's not the point, Lankford wanted people to know. \"... I am keenly aware we don't have the votes in the Senate. But the worst thing we can do is not talk about it [at] all and somehow make people presume that ... we don't care about children anymore. We do care passionately about children. The way you win the argument is to keep talking about it, not talk about it less.\"\n\nEven Trump's allies, like Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), pushed back on this idea that abortion is somehow a states' rights issue now. \"If we change our platform and we buy into the narrative [that] being pro-life is bad politics ... we're going to be net losers, because the people who believe like we do are going to abandon us because we've abandoned what makes us different.\" Presidential candidates come and go, he pointed out -- but the platform \"is foundational.\"\n\nOthers from the former president's cabinet, Mike Pompeo and Ben Carson, have sounded the alarm on watering down the GOP's principles. \"I think it's a mistake,\" the former secretary of State shook his head. \"It will be difficult to get federal legislative limits,\" he admitted, but that doesn't mean we abandon that fight.\n\nAs Perkins emphasized in a conversation with pro-life leader Chuck Donovan, whose expertise spans five decades, including the Reagan administration, this isn't about politics. \"If there is a moral absolute,\" that we are in fact \"endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights\" like life, \"if that's an absolute, it doesn't stop at the state line. ... This is something that is universal.\" Calling it a states' issue, as this version of the platform does, is \"basically the same argument that the party had with the nation in 1856 over slavery and polygamy.\" You can't relegate life to the states, Donovan insists, because there's \"a bundle of federal legislation in existence that protects unborn children from being attacked.\"\n\n\"We have the Child Health Insurance Program, which specifically says the states may design programs that properly treat the unborn child as a beneficiary of those programs -- not a target. We have the Medicaid program, whatever you think of it, it's a federal-state partnership. And as of today, 42% of the births in the United States are to Medicaid eligible mothers. So it matters supremely whether the baby is a beneficiary of that program or a target of it.\" There's the military, he continues, \"that's federal jurisdiction. What do we do with military hospitals? We have the VA now being pushed by Joe Biden to provide abortion or refer for abortion. You have the District of Columbia, which allows abortions up to birth. ... And if Congress doesn't deal with it, then right there in our nation's capital, a few blocks from the halls that honor Jefferson and Lincoln, we will have babies near term being killed. It's unacceptable. \"\n\nAnd then there's the Wild West of the abortion pill that makes undermining state laws even easier, Chuck points out. \"You may not have abortion permissible in your state, but ... thanks to our Food and Drug Administration, they can mail your 13-year-old daughter abortion pills. She didn't even have to be pregnant. They can send them along and encourage her to use them if she needs them. They can encourage minors to be brought across state lines. They oppose limits that respect the rights of parents. So it matters to Rhode Island what happens in New York State,\" he underscored. \"It matters to Texas, what's permitted in Kansas. And essentially it comes back, though, to the question, is the protection of life a universal principle? And what happens when we walk away from that?\"\n\nAt the end of the day, this is one of those areas of clear contrast between the Republican and Democratic Parties, FRC's president emphasized. The GOP has become the party of life with \"the Democratic Party becoming ... literally [the party of] abortion until the moment of birth [with taxpayer funding].\"\n\n\"We have a chance, post-Dobbs, to protect the unborn,\" Donovan wanted people to know. \"But I have to tell you, we're not going to get there by retreat. The Republican Party, if it abandons almost 50 years of pro-life commitment, I think it's dooming the nation in some ways; it's certainly dooming itself.\"\n\nAs for Perkins, who left the committee vote Monday morning frustrated and disappointed at the RNC's missed opportunities on life, he's not giving up the fight. \"Look, I'm going to continue to champion the unborn,\" he reiterated. \"Number one, we have to redouble our efforts as it pertains to standing for human life -- supporting mothers in crisis pregnancies, adopting children, promoting these policies at the state level -- but still advocating and pointing out that this idea that this is just a states' issue is logically flawed, [as] we've seen with the abortion pill [comprising] 70% of all abortions.\"\n\n\"We need to continue to pray,\" he urged. \"We need to continue to vote, and we need to continue to stand.\"\n\nAsked what kind of impact this might have, Perkins was honest. \"I can only say that, unfortunately, I think it dampens enthusiasm. ... To what degree, I don't know -- but the elections are so close we can't afford any deviation.\" As for the party's critics who accuse him of being too tough on Trump, Tony said earnestly, \"That's not my intention. I was trying to help him. ... But I cannot compromise biblical truth to advance a temporal political objective. I won't do it,\" he insisted. \"I just can't do it.\"", "source": {"uri": "lifenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_ertelt@lifenews.com", "name": "Steven

Marsha Blackburn celebrated her successful leadership overseeing the panel charged with crafting the platform for the Republican National Committee, touting the GOP's 2024 platform as a \"concise\" document that \"will draw more Americans to the Republican Party.\"\n\n\"The reason it earned the adoption so quickly is because people got it this morning.

The draft, itled the \"2024 GOP PLATFORM: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,\" walks voters through 20 promises former President Trump, as well as other Republican officials, are making to voters ahead of November, including sealing the border and ending the \"migrant invasion,\" ending inflation, preventing \"World War Three\" and uniting the U.S. \"by bringing it to new and record levels of success.\"\n\nBlackburn explained to Fox News Digital that the platform was crafted to address top voter concerns Trump has personally heard from the American people, brushing off questions regarding whether the platform was written with the Democratic Party's disarray in mind, or whether President Biden would actually be the party's nominee come November.\n\nTRUMP FOCUSED ON CAMPAIGNING, AS DEMS ARE 'IN DISARRAY' AMID BIDEN CHAOS\n\n\"We're going to let the Democrats sort their issues out,\" Blackburn said when asked about the Democratic Party's current disarray. \"What I can say is this platform is going to be well received by so many people. We've already heard from so many people how well received it is. And that they're so pleased to see instead of an 80-page, 60-page, 100-, 200-page document, that this is something that they can take to lunch, to their coffee group, to their Bunco group, their Sunday school class, and they can read it and discuss it, and use it to get people involved in the process and voting in November.\"\n\nWhen asked if the platform was crafted with the intention of defeating Biden in November or perhaps another nominee as calls mount for Biden to bow out of the race over concerns regarding his mental acuity, Blackburn said it was designed with a focus on the American people.\n\nBIDEN SURROGATE NEWSOM SAYS CALLS BY DEMOCRATS FOR PRESIDENT TO STEP ASIDE 'NOT HELPFUL'\n\n\"This platform is crafted to make certain that the American people know what Republicans are for, and they know what President Trump is for. This platform is simple, concise, easy to read, and it will be used from candidates from your local, state and federal elections. And it is a document we will use to send President Donald Trump back to the White House.\"\n\nBlackburn said that Trump personally had input on the platform, noting he \"read it, reviewed it, edited it, and approved it,\" and also called into the platform comittee's meeting on Monday.\n\n\"As we got started on today's activities, President Trump called in, and wished everyone well, thanked everyone for volunteering to be there and serving on the platform committee. And talked about some of the issues that he is hearing and the broad net that they cast,\" she said.\n\nSOME TOP HOUSE DEMOCRATS URGE BIDEN TO STEP ASIDE\n\nBlackburn pointed to Trump's recent vow that if re-elected, workers in the service industry would no longer face taxes on their tips, pointing Fox Digital to point number six of the platform, which reads: \"LARGE TAX CUTS FOR WORKERS, AND NO TAX ON TIPS!\"\n\n\"That gives you an idea of how granular this was to what he is hearing, what many of us who are in elected office are hearing. And what the American people are saying: 'Would you please put some attention on these issues that affect us.' And I think that really is one of the primary points ... this election is about them. It's not about the bureaucrats. It's not about elected officials. It is about them and their way of life,\" she said.\n\nBlackburn touted that, unlike previous party platforms that dragged on for dozens of pages, the 2024 platform is \"simple\" and easily digested by the American people.\n\n\"I am one of those that has for years said we need to make this simple. It doesn't have to be long. It needs to be concise. It needs to be simply stated, and it should be something that people look forward to printing out and reading and sharing with their friends,\" she said.\n\nThe platform this election cycle notably only mentions abortion once, instead focusing on the preservation of life and returning power to the states when developing laws surrounding abortion. Blackburn said that when the platform was drafted, committee members had to take into account the Dobbs decision of 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade, effectively ended the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion and ruled that individual states have the power to allow, limit or ban abortion procedures.\n\nEX-OBAMA ADVISER SAYS BIDEN CAN'T BEAT 'FATHER TIME' AND IS 'NOT WINNING THIS RACE'\n\n\"And so, having as we do with all other issues, whether it's defending religious liberty, or protecting free speech, or working to end the gender insanity - this left-wing gender insanity - and protecting our rights and freedoms. What the platform says is we proudly stand for families and for life.\"\n\n\"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process, and that the United States are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights. And that was a very appropriate way to approach this. This responsibility has come back to the states. The states are in the lead on this,\" she continued.\n\nBIDEN'S 'DISASTER' DEBATE PERFORMANCE SPARKS MEDIA MELTDOWN, CALLS FOR HIM TO WITHDRAW FROM 2024 RACE\n\nTrump touted the platform on his Truth Social account on Monday as a \"forward-looking Agenda with strong promises that we will accomplish very quickly\" while thanking Blackburn and Florida Rep. Michael Waltz, who served as vice chair on the committee, for their \"tireless work to PUT AMERICA FIRST.\"\n\n\"We are, quite simply, the Party of Common Sense! America needs determined Republican Leadership at every level of Government to address the core threats to our very survival: Our disastrously Open Border, our weakened Economy, Inflation, crippling restrictions on American Energy Production, our depleted Military, attacks on the American System of Justice, the Weaponization of Politics, and much more,\" he wrote.\n\nTRUMP APPROVAL RATING TOPS 50% AS HE LEADS BIDEN ON VOTERS' TOP TWO ISSUES: POLL\n\nFollowing its committee passage Monday, the platform will go to a full vote Tuesday before it is officially approved at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee.\n\n\"This is something that will draw more Americans to the Republican Party. I quite honestly believe that when they print this document off and look at it, they're going to open that first page and see that the Republican National Committee has dedicated this document to the forgotten men and women of America. And then, in the preamble, we talk about common sense, and we end with citing those 20 promises that people want to see activity on: energy issues, border issues, crime issues, making certain that we are dealing with rebuilding our military, being strong at home and abroad, protecting our freedoms, dealing with the weaponization of government.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_colton@foxnews.com", "name": "Emma Colton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blackburn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Blackburn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marsha Blackburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

It was, after all, just four years ago when the RNC -- for the first time since 1856 -- skipped the platform-writing process altogether and instead declared that it simply wanted whatever Donald Trump said he wanted.\n\nWith this in mind, the fact that Republicans actually bothered to write down their principles, priorities, values, and goals certainly looks like progress -- at least until one actually reads the document the party produced. USA Today's Rex Huppke made the case that the Republicans' new platform reads as if it were generated \"by an authoritarian-leaning AI that was fed a Trump rally transcript.\"\n\nWhat, specifically, makes the Republican platform so extraordinary? Let us count the ways.\n\nThe preamble: Before the blueprint begins in earnest, there's a preamble, spanning nearly three pages, which appears to have been written by Trump himself. It's filled with vapid, all-caps, bumper-sticker-style declarations, featuring a combination of vague goals and proposals that President Joe Biden has already delivered.\n\nThe contents: Some of the reporting about the new RNC blueprint has suggested that it was made deliberately more \"moderate\" than some far-right partisans preferred. Don't believe it. As American Bridge's Brandon Weathersby summarized in a statement, \"The Republican National Committee platform is one of the most extreme party platforms ever in the history of modern presidential elections.\" From immigration to education, taxes to law enforcement, there should be no doubt that this assessment is correct.\n\nThe omissions: Hoping to avoid campaign-season attacks, the Republican platform no longer calls for federal prohibitions against abortion and same-sex marriage, but as the editorial board of The Washington Post summarized, \"The former president wants the 2024 GOP platform to be anodyne, but don't be fooled. He has an extreme agenda.\"\n\nThe language: It was hard not to notice that the new Republican platform condemns \"Christian-hating Communists,\" which is a phrase with a deeply ugly history.\n\nThe length: The party's platform in 2016 was nearly 60 pages. There were some reports indicating that this total, at Trump's insistence, would be cut in half. Those reports understated matters: The actual text of the 2024 platform spans roughly 10 pages -- reinforcing the fact that the contemporary Republican Party just isn't serious about governing and policymaking.\n\nThe process: While Republicans have spent decades crafting the party's platform in public, this year, the process was moved behind closed doors. Even more incredibly, Politico published this report on the way in which the platform was approved: \"Representatives from Trump's campaign walked around the room with a 'vote yes' sign as voice votes were being held. ... One RNC member who was present inquired about why staff of the Trump campaign and RNC were taking photographs of delegates as they voted.\"\n\nFor now, the document is still a draft platform: As NBC News reported, the blueprint \"still must get approval from the full Republican National Committee.\" Watch this space.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240709-donald-trump-al-0811-6feee0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716769", "eventUri": "eng-9716769", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

In 2020, then-President Donald Trump mused he might shrink his party's platform from 66 pages in 2016 to just one page - but ultimately the party just kept the same platform document from four years earlier. Even as far back as 1996, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole claimed he had never read his party's platform.\n\nThe 2024 Republican Party platform, released July 8, closely follows Trump's policy proposals and campaign rhetoric. If the Republicans just adapted Trump's regular speeches, and Dole didn't even read it, why should you care about a party's platform?\n\nAs a scholar of U.S. party politics, I have seen that party platforms are a vital clue about which groups hold real power in the two major national parties. They can also help you predict what the national government will actually do during the next four years.\n\nWhere does the platform come from?\n\nEach national party has a platform-writing committee, composed of major party figures and representatives of interest groups closely linked with the party. They do their work in the spring and summer before the presidential conventions.\n\nWhen there's a first-term president, his or her party's committee gets its direction from the White House; presidents don't want to run for reelection on a platform other than their own. The opposition party's platform is very much under the control of its presidential candidate - for the Republicans, this year, Donald Trump - and his closest advisers.\n\nThe opposition party's platform committee normally holds hearings around the nation, in person and online, to hear from the public. In reality, those who testify are almost always leaders of interest groups.\n\nIn 2024, the Republicans decided not to follow that process. The Republican National Committee's platform committee met in private instead to create a platform under Trump's guidance.\n\nWriters of party platforms must combine the stirring - though very abstract - values that brought supporters to the party with the specifics desired by the party's allied interest groups as the price of their loyalty.\n\nThat means simultaneously touting rhetorical key points such as strong national defense, fair treatment of all people or a great educational system while making particular promises, such as pledges to nominate right-wing judges and devolve abortion policy to the states or reduce particular emissions that cause climate change. The strongest party factions can get their goals written directly into the text of the party platform.\n\nAs a result, platform writers have to navigate the tension between candidates' desire for a broad appeal to voters and interest groups' insistence on explicit commitments to their goals. Typically, most of the platform's language involves stirring appeals to the broader electorate. The rest is a laundry list of specific promises to organized groups.\n\nOnce it's written, the platform is adopted by the party's quadrennial national convention. In times past, fierce debate ensued over some platform elements, such as abortion. Now, the parties are so polarized, and the national conventions have become such a public display of unity and enthusiasm, that they try to avoid debate about the platform. JL: alt text missing for caption below\n\nWhat happens then?\n\nThe party leadership can't do anything to enforce its platform - and can't even expel candidates who reject or only weakly support the platform. That's because party leaders don't choose the party's candidates; the voters do, in primary elections, and voters don't necessarily heed the advice of national party leaders.\n\nThe classic example of this is Rep. Phil Gramm, elected by voters in his Texas House district as a Democrat in 1978. Gramm sided with Republican House members to support President Ronald Reagan's policies, and his Democratic colleagues punished him by taking away his seat on the prized House Budget Committee.\n\nUndaunted, Gramm returned to his district and ran for his old seat as a Republican. He won. The fact that Gramm had been elected as a Democrat but rejected a key plank in the Democratic national platform apparently didn't bother his voters at all.\n\nThere are even times a national party would rather that its candidate in a particular district not support the party's platform. For instance, if Republican voters in a swing congressional district have chosen to nominate a candidate who supports government action to combat climate change, that's probably the type of Republican most likely to win in that district.

In 2020, then-President Donald Trump mused he might shrink his party's platform from 66 pages in 2016 to just one page - but ultimately the party just kept the same platform document from four years earlier. Even as far back as 1996, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole claimed he had never read his party's platform.\n\nThe 2024 Republican Party platform, released July 8, closely follows Trump's policy proposals and campaign rhetoric.\n\nIf the Republicans just adapted Trump's regular speeches, and Dole didn't even read it, why should you care about a party's platform?\n\nAs a scholar of U.S. party politics, I have seen that party platforms are a vital clue about which groups hold real power in the two major national parties. They can also help you predict what the national government will actually do during the next four years.\n\nEach national party has a platform-writing committee, composed of major party figures and representatives of interest groups closely linked with the party. They do their work in the spring and summer before the presidential conventions.\n\nWhen there's a first-term president, his or her party's committee gets its direction from the White House; presidents don't want to run for reelection on a platform other than their own. The opposition party's platform is very much under the control of its presidential candidate - for the Republicans, this year, Donald Trump - and his closest advisers.\n\nThe opposition party's platform committee normally holds hearings around the nation, in person and online, to hear from the public. In reality, those who testify are almost always leaders of interest groups.\n\nIn 2024, the Republicans decided not to follow that process. The Republican National Committee's platform committee met in private instead to create a platform under Trump's guidance.\n\nWriters of party platforms must combine the stirring - though very abstract - values that brought supporters to the party with the specifics desired by the party's allied interest groups as the price of their loyalty.\n\nThat means simultaneously touting rhetorical key points such as strong national defense, fair treatment of all people or a great educational system while making particular promises, such as pledges to nominate right-wing judges and devolve abortion policy to the states or reduce particular emissions that cause climate change. The strongest party factions can get their goals written directly into the text of the party platform.\n\nAs a result, platform writers have to navigate the tension between candidates' desire for a broad appeal to voters and interest groups' insistence on explicit commitments to their goals. Typically, most of the platform's language involves stirring appeals to the broader electorate. The rest is a laundry list of specific promises to organized groups.\n\nOnce it's written, the platform is adopted by the party's quadrennial national convention. In times past, fierce debate ensued over some platform elements, such as abortion. Now, the parties are so polarized, and the national conventions have become such a public display of unity and enthusiasm, that they try to avoid debate about the platform. JL: alt text missing for caption below\n\nThe party leadership can't do anything to enforce its platform - and can't even expel candidates who reject or only weakly support the platform. That's because party leaders don't choose the party's candidates; the voters do, in primary elections, and voters don't necessarily heed the advice of national party leaders.\n\nThe classic example of this is Rep. Phil Gramm, elected by voters in his Texas House district as a Democrat in 1978. Gramm sided with Republican House members to support President Ronald Reagan's policies, and his Democratic colleagues punished him by taking away his seat on the prized House Budget Committee.\n\nUndaunted, Gramm returned to his district and ran for his old seat as a Republican. He won. The fact that Gramm had been elected as a Democrat but rejected a key plank in the Democratic national platform apparently didn't bother his voters at all.\n\nThere are even times a national party would rather that its candidate in a particular district not support the party's platform. For instance, if Republican voters in a swing congressional district have chosen to nominate a candidate who supports government action to combat climate change, that's probably the type of Republican most likely to win in that district. It wouldn't benefit national party leaders to fight for a pro-coal and -oil candidate who would likely lose that district to a Democrat.\n\nPlatforms may not bind elected officials, and they may go unread by almost everybody. Yet they do have meaning.\n\nThose who do read them can make a good guess about how a party's elected officials will behave in office. Researchers find that when a party controls Congress and the White House, its spending priorities reflect issues emphasized in its platform most of the time. Most presidents make some effort to carry out their campaign promises; when they fail, it's normally been because of congressional opposition or changing events.\n\nShifts in the platform over time are often significant indicators of change in the party. When the 1980 Republican platform dropped the party's long-standing commitment to the Equal Rights Amendment and adopted strong anti-abortion language, that was clear evidence of the shift toward right-wing populism that now characterizes the Republican Party.\n\nSo you may never read a party platform, but don't dismiss it as fluff; at least since World War II, it can tell you a lot about [how the party will spend your tax dollars] and seek to regulate your behavior if it wins power.\n\nThis is an updated version of an article originally published July 23, 2020.\n\nMarjorie Hershey does not

Wade and sent the matter back to state Legislatures.\n\nTrump Campaign Senior Advisors Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said the new platform \"articulates his vision to Make America Great Again in a way that is concise and digestible for every voter.\"\n\n\"While Joe Biden and Democrats argue about who will be at the top of their ticket and have implemented policies that have raised prices on everyday families, opened the floodgates to migrant crime via wide-open borders, shackled American energy with red tape forced by Washington bureaucrats, and sewn chaos across the world through weak foreign policy, President Trump will Make America Great Again through these America First principles,\" they said in a joint statement.\n\nAccording to the RNC, the short party platform -- it can be broken down to a list of 20 bullet points -- is a \"forward-looking agenda\" that will be implemented \"very quickly when we win the White House and Republican majorities in the House and Senate.\"\n\nSome of the party priorities outlined in the platform are sealing the border, the mass arrest and subsequent deportation of 11 million human beings, putting an end to inflation, energy and manufacturing dominance, preventing World War III, and maintaining the dominance of the U.S. dollar as a tool of international trade, among several others.\n\nAbsent, unlike in past years, is a call to ban abortion nationally. Trump has made clear that he will not support a national ban, telling his supporters to be realistic and that he's \"got to get elected.\"\n\nAlso missing is any reference to the LGBTQ community or the rights of same sex couples to marry. The platform does include a plan to \"cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, radical gender ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\"\n\nMassachusetts Republican Party Chair Amy Carnevale served as whip and Chair of the Sub-Committee on the Economy in drafting the GOP's new agenda, and she says the platform \"presents a unifying agenda, outlining what Americans can expect under another Trump presidency.\"\n\n\"It signifies a new direction of optimism for the Republican Party on a national level, addressing how we plan to rectify the disastrous outcomes of Biden-era policies and shifting to address the concerns of people in Massachusetts and across the Nation. Each policy in the platform builds on the others. Unleashing America's energy sector will reduce inflation and boost the economy, complemented by cutting taxes and regulations. Sealing the border to address the severe immigration crisis will free up funds for veterans and Social Security. The platform is pragmatic and straightforward, poised to usher America's economy and citizens into a new golden age,\" she said in a statement.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign staff said voters should not be fooled by the new GOP platform, that Republicans cannot be trusted when it comes to reproductive health or the rights of American minorities, and that \"Donald Trump has made it clear with his own words and actions what he will do if he regains power - rip away women's freedoms, punish women, and ban abortion nationwide.\"\n\n\"You don't have to take it from us, take it from Trump himself: He's 'proud' to have 'killed' Roe v. Wade and unleashed extreme bans with no exceptions for rape or incest, which he calls 'a beautiful thing to watch.' He promised to be 'leading the charge' to ban abortion nationwide, and said he'd fight 'side by side' with extremists who want to ban abortion entirely. Trump himself said that women should be punished for having an abortion, that doctors should be criminalized for doing their jobs, and that he's 'looking at' restrictions on birth control,\" Biden-Harris 2024 Spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_medsger@bostonherald.com", "name": "Matthew Medsger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Wiles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susie Wiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

So interesting, in fact, that the story was all over the mainstream press. The only problem with this very interesting story is that it didn't happen.\n\nOn Monday, a draft of the GOP platform began circulating ahead of the Republican convention. The coverage of the platform's position on abortion was remarkable in its uniformity. The New York Times' headline blared, \"Following Trump's Lead, Republicans Adopt Platform That Softens Stance on Abortion.\" NBC News announced, \"Trump Pushes New GOP Platform Softening Party's Positions on Abortion and Same-Sex Marriage.\" The Washington Post concurred: \"GOP Adopts Platform That Softens Language on Abortion, Same-Sex Marriage.\" These headlines could not be more misleading. (One outlet, The 19th, commendably got it right.)\n\nFirst, although the new platform omits language from the 2016 version opposing marriage equality, it is silent on equal rights for same-sex couples, and certainly does not endorse them. That omission is meaningful, and should not be interpreted as moderation. The Trumpified right-wing majority on the Supreme Court has already taken quiet aim at the decision that granted same-sex couples the right to marry, and some of the sitting justices, such as Samuel Alito, have denounced that decision outright. Once the right-wing bloc on the Court has the numbers and the right case, that decision will likely be overturned.\n\nRead: What would Trump really do on abortion?\n\nIn other words, the removal of the previous opposition does not amount to a recognition of equal rights for same-sex couples. It is a strategic silence asserted in the belief that the Roberts Court will narrow those rights in its own time without the GOP having to pay a political price for making that happen. Other language in the new platform refers to being able to \"act in accordance with those [religious] Beliefs, not just in places of Worship, but in everyday life.\" This is about justifying religious exemptions to anti-discrimination laws, which will target LGBTQ Americans and women, among others. This is an agenda that contemplates second-class citizenship for anyone who is not a right-wing Christian, and elevated status for those who are.\n\nSecond, if the party's stance on marriage equality is a matter of strategic silence, the media coverage of the abortion language amounts to strategic illiteracy. Here is the plank, under a heading that reads \"Republicans Will Protect and Defend a Vote of the People, From Within the States, on the Issue of Life\":\n\nWe proudly stand for families and Life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People. We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\n\nThe key language here is \"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied Life or Liberty without Due Process, and that the States are, therefore, free to pass Laws protecting those Rights.\" The actual language of the Fourteenth Amendment, plain to anyone who has read it, says, \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nThe doctrine that a fetus is morally equivalent to a fully born child is called \"fetal personhood\"; it asserts that a fetus obtains constitutional rights at the moment of conception, and therefore, ending a pregnancy is identical to murder. In its 2016 platform, the Republican Party made this claim by saying that the Fourteenth Amendment's due-process protections guarantee that \"the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed,\" and calling for a constitutional amendment to enshrine this understanding. Eight years later, the Trump-appointed justices on the Supreme Court who helped strike down Roe v. Wade have conservatives hoping that an amendment won't actually be necessary to change the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment -- that the right-wing justices will simply rewrite the Constitution to ban abortion nationally on those grounds. Instead of calling for an amendment, this year's platform asserts the same belief in fetal personhood, and says that protecting it is up to state law.\n\nBut this is incoherent. If the Fourteenth Amendment bars abortion -- the implication of the doctrine of fetal personhood -- then no state laws are necessary to enforce that constitutional guarantee. The wording of the platform restates the same radical position that Republicans took in the 2016 platform, but makes it more confusing. There is no softening of the GOP's position on abortion here, just a garbled reiteration of the party's position that abortion for any reason should be illegal everywhere in the United States, hidden behind an irrelevant aside about states' rights.\n\nFrom the January/February 2024 issue: A plan to outlaw abortion everywhere\n\nFurthermore, there is no \"states' rights\" version of the Fourteenth Amendment. The entire point of the Fourteenth Amendment is that the states cannot do whatever they want, that they cannot violate the fundamental rights of their residents. In the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment adopted by the Republican Party in its platform, abortion rights are unconstitutional because a fetus is a person and therefore entitled to those constitutional protections.\n\nThe point, presumably, of the muddled and contradictory language adopted by the platform was to get the media to run with a bunch of headlines announcing that the party was moderating on abortion, while allowing the language to serve as a promise to anti-abortion activists, who fully understand that Donald Trump intends to follow through on their agenda while in office. That includes, as my colleague Elaine Godfrey reported in February, banning abortion through novel enforcement of the 19th-century Comstock Act without any need for Congress. As Godfrey wrote at the time, \"Any Trump endorsement of a national abortion limit is nothing more than strategic messaging -- a ploy to win over moderate voters in the general election.\" The same is true of this new state-by-state approach.\n\nTrump and the Republican Party have records on abortion that show what they would do with federal power. Trump appointed three of the six justices who issued the decision overturning a national right to an abortion after he promised to do just that. Republican-controlled states acted swiftly to ban abortion as soon as they could, not just enacting draconian bans and restrictions on speech and movement related to abortion, but seeking to criminalize leaving the state to get an abortion or providing information on how to get one. Republicans in the Senate blocked a bill to protect in vitro fertilization. As with anything else, what politicians have actually done is a much more reliable guide to what they will do than what they say they will do.\n\nIf Trump returns to the White House, the power of the federal government will likely be focused on restricting Americans' rights to free expression, travel, and bodily autonomy in the name of preventing abortion. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation blueprint for a second Trump administration, which Trump has unconvincingly attempted to disavow despite the plan having been written by veterans of his first administration, details possible avenues for such restrictions. The Project 2025 agenda contemplates allowing employers to deny health-care coverage for contraception to their workers, allowing hospitals to refuse to provide abortion care when someone's life is at risk, and otherwise limiting access to abortion medication and contraception. Project 2025 also wants to use the Department of Health and Human Services to force states to track abortions in order to crack down on what it calls \"abortion tourism,\" that is, women being forced to leave their home state to obtain medical care that they are prevented from getting where they live. Last year, a Texas mother named Kate Cox had to flee the state to get an abortion because her fetus had a fatal abnormality, and carrying the pregnancy to term could have endangered both her life and her ability to get pregnant again. This is what the people who would run the next Trump administration regard as \"abortion tourism.\"\n\nThe idea that Republicans would not do such things because they are unpopular ignores the fact that abortion bans are also deeply unpopular -- even conservative voters in some red states have rejected them since the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision -- and many Republican-run states instituted draconian bans on abortion anyway. Red states' response to voters rejecting Republican extremism on abortion at the polls was not moderating on the issue, but attempting to take the decision out of voters' hands entirely by preventing abortion from being the subject of statewide referendums in which abortion bans keep losing.\n\nThe GOP platform is an obvious bait and switch, and it doesn't even try very hard to hide the switch. As the writer Jessica Valenti notes, \"The platform doesn't change a single thing about what Trump would do if elected, nor does it mean that there's an actual rift between his campaign and the anti-abortion movement. This is political theater, and the mainstream press is handing out programs.\" The GOP platform on abortion does not show Trump or the GOP \"softening\" or shifting on abortion rights; it shows them trying to avoid the political consequences of their position on the matter by hiding them in plain sight.\n\nIt has been clear from the beginning that Trump regards abortion rights as a political vulnerability for Republicans and would seek to seem moderate on the issue, just as it's clear that the anti-abortion camp understands that Trump will do its bidding when in office, as he did last time. One reason he may get the chance is mainstream press organizations' embracing the narrative of Trump as an abortion moderate -- despite all available evidence to the contrary.", "source": {"uri":

The 2024 platform removed historic pro-life principles that have long been the foundation of the platform. I urge delegates attending next week's Republican Convention to restore language to our party's platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.\"\n\nTrump imposed his priorities on the RNC's platform committee as he seeks to steer clear during his campaign of strict abortion language, even while taking credit for setting up the 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court. Trump appointed three of the six justices who voted in the majority to overturn the 1973 precedent that established a national right to have an abortion.\n\nThe scaled-down platform -- just 16 pages and with limited specifics on many key Republican issues -- reflects a desire by the Trump campaign to avoid giving Democrats more material for their warnings about the former president's intentions if he wins back the White House. President Joe Biden's campaign has repeatedly highlighted the \"Project 2025'' document produced by Trump allies as well as Trump's own promises to impose wide-ranging tariffs, replace thousands of government workers with party loyalists and stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\nIn March, Pence announced he won't back Trump this November.\n\n\"It should come as no surprise that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year,\" Pence said in an interview with Fox News Channel, weighing in for the first time since the former president became the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\nPence ran against Trump for their party's nomination but dropped his bid before voting began last year.\n\nHe was among Trump's most loyal defenders but broke with his two-time running mate by refusing to go along with Trump's unconstitutional scheme to try to remain in power after losing the 2020 election.

Marsha Blackburn oversaw the panel charged with crafting the platform and said the document \"will draw more Americans to the Republican Party.\" President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, personally had input on the platform, Blackburn said, noting he \"read it, reviewed it, edited it, and approved it,\" and also called into the platform committee's meeting on Monday.\n\n\"One of the complaints that we have heard from people is, well, 'Look, that platform is so long, nobody reads it, it gets used against our candidates, by their opponents, and it is time for us to be simple, concise and specific about what we're going to do,\" Blackburn told Fox News Digital in a phone interview Monday evening.\n\nTRUMP FOCUSED ON CAMPAIGNING, AS DEMS ARE 'IN DISARRAY' AMID BIDEN CHAOS\n\n\"The reason it earned the adoption so quickly is because people got it this morning. They were able to quickly read through it - because it is a total of 16 pages. And as they looked through it, they thought, 'This is really good. It is solid. It is hitting the issues that the American people are talking about.' And one of the complaints that we have heard from people is, well, 'Look, that platform is so long, nobody reads it, it gets used against our candidates, by their opponents, and it is time for us to be simple, concise and specific about what we're going to do,\" Blackburn told Fox News Digital in a phone interview Monday evening.\n\nSOFTENED ABORTION LANGUAGE IN TRUMP-APPROVED GOP PLATFORM IRKS SOME SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES\n\nThe Republican National Committee's Platform Committee, which Blackburn served as chairwoman, overwhelmingly passed its draft party platform Monday in an 84-12 vote. The draft, titled the \"2024 GOP PLATFORM: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!,\" walks voters through 20 promises former President Trump, as well as other Republican officials, are making to voters ahead of November, including sealing the border and ending the \"migrant invasion,\" ending inflation, preventing \"World War Three\" and uniting the U.S. \"by bringing it to new and record levels of success.\"\n\nBlackburn explained to Fox News Digital that the platform was crafted to address top voter concerns Trump has personally heard from the American people, brushing off questions regarding whether the platform was written with the Democratic Party's disarray in mind, or whether President Biden would actually be the party's nominee come November.\n\n\"We're going to let the Democrats sort their issues out,\" Blackburn said when asked about the Democratic Party's current disarray. \"What I can say is this platform is going to be well received by so many people. We've already heard from so many people how well received it is. And that they're so pleased to see instead of an 80-page, 60-page, 100-, 200-page document, that this is something that they can take to lunch, to their coffee group, to their Bunco group, their Sunday school class, and they can read it and discuss it, and use it to get people involved in the process and voting in November.\"\n\nWhen asked if the platform was crafted with the intention of defeating Biden in November or perhaps another nominee as calls mount for Biden to bow out of the race over concerns regarding his mental acuity, Blackburn said it was designed with a focus on the American people.\n\nBIDEN SURROGATE NEWSOM SAYS CALLS BY DEMOCRATS FOR PRESIDENT TO STEP ASIDE 'NOT HELPFUL'\n\n\"This platform is crafted to make certain that the American people know what Republicans are for, and they know what President Trump is for. This platform is simple, concise, easy to read, and it will be used from candidates from your local, state and federal elections. And it is a document we will use to send President Donald Trump back to the White House.\"\n\nBlackburn said that Trump personally had input on the platform, noting he \"read it, reviewed it, edited it, and approved it,\" and also called into the platform committee's meeting on Monday.\n\n\"As we got started on today's activities, President Trump called in, and wished everyone well, thanked everyone for volunteering to be there and serving on the platform committee. And talked about some of the issues that he is hearing and the broad net that they cast,\" she said.\n\nSOME TOP HOUSE DEMOCRATS URGE BIDEN TO STEP ASIDE\n\nBlackburn pointed to Trump's recent vow that if re-elected, workers in the service industry would no longer face taxes on their tips, pointing Fox Digital to point number six of the platform, which reads: \"LARGE TAX CUTS FOR WORKERS, AND NO TAX ON TIPS!\"\n\n\"That gives you an idea of how granular this was to what he is hearing, what many of us who are in elected office are hearing. And what the American people are saying: 'Would you please put some attention on these issues that affect us.' And I think that really is one of the primary points... this election is about them. It's not about the bureaucrats. It's not about elected officials. It is about them and their way of life,\" she said.\n\nBlackburn touted that, unlike previous party platforms that dragged on for dozens of pages, the 2024 platform is \"simple\" and easily digested by the American people.\n\n\"I am one of those that has for years said we need to make this simple. It doesn't have to be long. It needs to be concise. It needs to be simply stated, and it should be something that people look forward to printing out and reading and sharing with their friends,\" she said.\n\nThe platform this election cycle notably only mentions abortion once, instead focusing on the preservation of life and returning power to the states when developing laws surrounding abortion. Blackburn said that when the platform was drafted, committee members had to take into account the Dobbs decision of 2022, which overturned Roe v. Wade, effectively ended the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion and ruled that individual states have the power to allow, limit or ban abortion procedures.\n\nEX-OBAMA ADVISER SAYS BIDEN CAN'T BEAT 'FATHER TIME' AND IS 'NOT WINNING THIS RACE'\n\n\"And so, having as we do with all other issues, whether it's defending religious liberty, or protecting free speech, or working to end the gender insanity - this left-wing gender insanity - and protecting our rights and freedoms. What the platform says is we proudly stand for families and for life.\"\n\n\"We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process, and that the United States are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights. And that was a very appropriate way to approach this. This responsibility has come back to the states. The states are in the lead on this,\" she continued.\n\nBIDEN'S 'DISASTER' DEBATE PERFORMANCE SPARKS MEDIA MELTDOWN, CALLS FOR HIM TO WITHDRAW FROM 2024 RACE\n\nTrump touted the platform on his Truth Social account on Monday as a \"forward-looking Agenda with strong promises that we will accomplish very quickly\" while thanking Blackburn and Florida Rep. Michael Waltz, who served as vice chair on the committee, for their \"tireless work to PUT AMERICA FIRST.\"\n\n\"We are, quite simply, the Party of Common Sense! America needs determined Republican Leadership at every level of Government to address the core threats to our very survival: Our disastrously Open Border, our weakened Economy, Inflation, crippling restrictions on American Energy Production, our depleted Military, attacks on the American System of Justice, the Weaponization of Politics, and much more,\" he wrote.\n\nTRUMP APPROVAL RATING TOPS 50% AS HE LEADS BIDEN ON VOTERS' TOP TWO ISSUES: POLL\n\nFollowing its committee passage Monday, the platform will go to a full vote Tuesday before it is officially approved at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee.\n\n\"This is something that will draw more Americans to the Republican Party. I quite honestly believe that when they print this document off and look at it, they're going to open that first page and see that the Republican National Committee has dedicated this document to the forgotten men and women of America. And then, in the preamble, we talk about common sense, and we end with citing those 20 promises that people want to see activity on: energy issues, border issues, crime issues, making certain that we are dealing with rebuilding our military, being strong at home and abroad, protecting our freedoms, dealing with the weaponization of government.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxwilmington.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "foxwilmington.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fox_wilmington@foxwilmington.com", "name": "Fox Wilmington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blackburn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Blackburn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World War III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marsha Blackburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The document is calculated to appeal to the needs of ordinary voters sick of cultural and economic Marxism. However, purported Evangelical Christians are suddenly frantically hostile to the RNC and to Trump. There's something deeply weird about this position, given that it hands a win to \"no limits on abortion\" Democrats.\n\nYou can read the 16-page, small-font 2024 Republican platform here. However, if you don't want to, Wayne Allyn Root summarizes the core principles in the platform under the heading \"Trump chose the issues a huge majority of American voters agree on\":\n\nRoot is right: These are issues that appeal to most Americans, including their dislike for the Hamasniks and the alphabet-soup people taking over American education. It's a pro-American platform that cuts across racial, geographic, and economic divides. It's a broad-based MAGA winner, and anyone who wants to see the Democrat party harried (politically) from pillar to post should be happy with it.\n\nAnd yet what I see on X is screaming agony from pro-lifers who claim that, by leaving abortion off the platform, Trump is the second coming of Roe v. Wade:\n\nThis anger against Trump is weird, given that Trump is the most pro-life president in most of our lifetimes. He promised to end Roe v. Wade and, by nominating Supreme Court justices who take the Constitution seriously, he was able to get the correct ruling from the Court: Abortion is not a federal matter and, therefore, must be a state matter. (Check out the 10th Amendment.) That's a huge win, and, thanks to Trump, half of the American states have moderate to tough pro-Life laws. This is a far cry from the pre-Trump era when abortion was unlimited.\n\nAdditionally, the new Republican platform isn't pro-abortion. It simply goes back to core federal responsibilities and, properly, leaves abortion to the state parties.\n\nI think this speaks to a deep political naivete that characterizes conservatives on so many issues. They have goals but lack both strategy (the big plan to achieve the goal) and tactics (the specific steps in the plan). In this, they differ greatly from Democrats who, up until they painted themselves in a corner by backing a puppet with dementia, have proven to be exemplary strategists and tacticians.\n\nIf your goal is to end abortion in America, the first step to achieve that goal is to get Democrats out of power. After all, Democrats are the pro-abortion party. If they have their way, abortion would be legal even after the baby is born -- and, indeed, Princeton ethicist Peter Singer (who retired only last December) thinks abortion should be legal up to a month after the baby's birth.\n\nIf ousting Democrats is the necessary first step to reining in abortion, a bad tactic is to hysterically castigate the pro-life party's platform because it says the things it needs to say to appeal to the greatest number of voters, while leaving out your pet issue. Instead, you should applaud that platform for advancing you're the first step in your plan.\n\nAt the same time, you can and should bemoan in non-hysterical terms the fact that we live in a country where a pro-life stance can't be part of the platform. That is a tactic that advances your next strategic goal, which is to encourage more states to embrace pro-life laws. And of course, you should be ensuring that Democrats don't get to do an end-run around the Dobbs ruling by trying to federalize abortion via legislation.\n\nThere's something deeply weird about fierce pro-life advocates screaming so hysterically about the evil Republicans that they risk making other pro-life advocates unwilling to vote Republican. That, of course, increases the risk that Democrats retain the White House and Congress.\n\nEven if it doesn't succeed in keeping Evangelicals and other pro-lifers home on election day, that same hysteria will galvanize Democrats who are depressed at the thought of voting for Biden, Kamala, or whomever in the fall. In the face of all the screaming, the people who aren't the base (who are fanatic and will always vote) but are base adjacent (they share the values but will stay away from the polls if not sufficiently roused) will be roused. These lumpen leftists will have confirmed the base's claims that the only way to keep abortion alive in America is to support the Democrat party, no matter what corpse or moron sits atop it.\n\nI strongly suggest that the pro-life crowd moderate both strategy and tactics. What they're doing will empower the Democrats when they should be empowering the Republicans while working to keep a pro-life ethos within the party and, even more importantly, to change America's culture regarding abortion.", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Allyn_Root", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Allyn Root"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

NBC News would go on to call it an \"epic duel.\"\n\nShe did.\n\nIn 2016, having won the Democratic nomination, the focus turned from Clinton, the presumptive nominee, to Bernie Sanders, her main challenger, to see if he would support the her. The Washington Post called it \"a bruising primary season.\"\n\nHe did.\n\nAt the 2008 convention, Hillary Clinton released her delegates and formally nominated Barack Obama to be the party's nominee, saying, \"let's declare all together with one voice right here and right now that Barack Obama is our candidate and he will be our president.\"\n\nAt the 2016 convention Hillary Clinton delivered a speech designed to unite the party, telling Sanders supporters, \"I've heard you. Your cause is our cause.\"\n\nNothing like that will happen next week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, because those who opposed the party's presumptive nominee have not been invited to speak. Donald Trump has made no attempt to unite the party by embracing his critics within the party - and now he will exclude them.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Wildly Irresponsible': NY Times Blasted Over Debunked Parkinson's Doctor 'Innuendo'\n\nAs \"Republicans happily watch Democratic turmoil over Biden\" after the President's poor debate performance nearly two weeks ago, the GOP has many internal battles of its own that threaten party unity.\n\nNikki Haley, Donald Trump's former UN Ambassador, was the last candidate opposing him to drop out. After having denounced the \"chaos\" her former boss brings, and after declaring his mental fitness was in \"decline,\" in May she warned: \"Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me, and not assume that they're just going to be with him.\"\n\nIn January, Trump had warned he would blacklist Haley donors.\n\nOn Tuesday she released her delegates and called for \"unity,\" but stopped short of endorsing him.\n\nHaley has not been invited to the Republican National Convention and will neither speak nor attend, the Associated Press reported Tuesday.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was once considered the best chance Republicans had to defeat Donald Trump, in January dropped out of the race and endorsed the ex-president.\n\nHe, too, has not been invited to speak at the convention next week.\n\n\"DeSantis will be in Milwaukee, but only on the periphery of the convention,\" USA Today reports. \"The two-term Florida governor is scheduled to participate in a Moms for Liberty panel discussion and a breakfast with his state delegation. But a source familiar with the planning said DeSantis won't have a spot on the convention stage during the four-day affair.\"\n\nIt's not just on the national stage next week that voters will see how Trump has attempted to stomp out any dissent.\n\nFollowing the release of the draft Republican Party platform, reportedly in part written by Donald Trump, which \"could read like a MAGA rally,\" The New York Times reported, former Trump Vice President Mike Pence denounced the document.\n\nClaiming it \"removed historic pro-life principles that have long been the foundation of the platform,\" Pence said, \"I urge delegates attending next week's Republican Convention to restore language to our party's platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.\"\n\nOther leaders among the Christian far-right, which is one of the largest portions of Trump's base, have also denounced the RNC platform because it has removed some anti-abortion language, despite it actually paving the way for \"fetal personhood.\"\n\nRELATED: 'Pledge of Allegiance' to Trump: Draft RNC Platform Spins Abortion and LGBTQ Issues\n\nIn March, Pence announced he would not support Trump's re-election bid.\n\n\"It should come as no surprise that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year,\" Pence said.\n\n\"Pence has joined a faction of conservatives decrying the updated Republican National Committee platform rubber-stamped by former President Donald Trump for its inclusion of softened language on abortion, a marked change from past cycles,\" ABC News reports. Anti-LGBTQ hate group head Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, is a member of the RNC platform committee, and in an act of defiance submitted a minority report opposing the abortion language.\n\nIt's not just GOP leaders. After the Trump-endorsed platform was pushed through the committee with little debate, one platform committee member from Utah told WISN News (video below), \"they rolled us.\"\n\n\"It's never happened before,\" Gail Ruzicka said as she shook her head. \"There was no committees, we've always had subcommittees where we can go in and work on a section of the platform.\"\n\nBut leaders \"didn't allow any amendments,\" or discussion, she lamented.\n\n\"Everything they told us they were going to do isn't what happened.\"\n\n\"I didn't vote for this,\" she said, adding, \"I've never been treated so badly, to have them force this vote on us.\"\n\nRuzicka said they were given the draft language, had time just to glance at it before a motion was made and the committee voted on it. That platform will be voted on at the convention Monday.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the choreographed process -- which allowed no amendments to be discussed or voted upon -- was unbecoming of a party that champions free speech and due process. Delegates were given the platform this morning when they entered the convention hall with no time to review, much less the 72 hours that Republican lawmakers call for in the House of Representatives. Delegates were only given a few minutes of discussion before 'debate' was ended and a vote was taken.\"\n\nAnd on Capitol Hill, Trump's impact is imploding the far-right House Freedom Caucus.\n\n\"The House Freedom Caucus Monday night voted to eject Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) -- who supported the victorious Trump-endorsed candidate over the group's own chair Rep. Bob Goode in his failed primary last month -- spurring pro-Trump Rep.

It is a devastating indictment of our national values that neither of the national political parties' platforms will support federal protections for preborn children targeted for death by the abortion industry. The North Star of the pro-life movement remains equal protection for all as guaranteed to every person, regardless of their age or geography, under the 14th Amendment. In 2016 and 2020, the GOP platform embraced this truth by making it clear that \"the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to children before birth.\" Similar language has been a consistent part of the party platform since 1984. The draft 2024 platform, however, offers a watered-down statement that minimizes the hundreds of thousands of American children killed each year by abortion. This would be the first time in four decades that the GOP platform does not include language that supports federal protection for the preborn.\n\nWhile the new language is correct that the \"14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process,\" it is wrong when it says that the \"power\" to decide life or death \"has been given to the states and to a vote of the people.\" When states discriminate against preborn children by denying the equal protection of their laws against homicide, they act unconstitutionally. There is no \"states' right\" to permit elective abortion, which subjects thousands of American children each day to brutal, and for many, painful deaths. The policies proposed in this platform fall desperately short of justice.\n\nThe new platform says the party will \"oppose late-term abortion\" but does not mention opposing abortion at any other time. This false dichotomy suggests that older babies are somehow more valuable than younger babies. That is a morally and scientifically ridiculous position. Human life begins at the moment of fertilization. From that moment on, every human being has a right to life and equal protection. Holding that older preborn children deserve legal protection while younger children can be killed with impunity is destructive and false. A significant majority of abortions are performed early in pregnancy. More than 90% of abortions happen before 15 weeks gestation; opposition to \"late-term\" abortions alone would permit the vast majority of abortions to continue.\n\nResearch suggests that each year there are at least two million embryos - each one a unique human life - that are created via IVF but are never born, because they either die during the IVF process, are frozen indefinitely, or are directly destroyed. It is profoundly anti-life and barbaric to enact laws that allow the callous mass killing of preborn children, simply because they were created through IVF. Infertility can be an incredibly painful burden and is increasingly common. But the solution cannot be to deny legal protections to human embryos or to allow them to be frozen or killed at will in America's IVF industry; however, this is what the draft platform suggests when it says that the party will be supporting policies that advance access to IVF.\n\nThe new platform also supports advancing \"access to birth control\" in the same plank intended to satisfy pro-life Americans. 51% of women seeking abortion in the United States reported that they had used a contraceptive method in the month they became pregnant. Birth control contributes to an abortion mindset, where sex is totally disconnected from procreation, leading to abortion being used as a form of backup birth control.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic Party platform is also catastrophic for human life, as the current version reads, \"We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion.\"\n\nA democratic majority that disregards the equal natural and constitutional rights of the minority has no legitimate right to rule. Democratic majorities cannot deny the right to life to powerless minority groups. And there is no more powerless group than the preborn. They cannot vote, they cannot protest, they cannot speak -- but they are human beings. The fundamental right to life should not be subject to the whims of state legislatures or voter majorities. Roe v. Wade's gravest error was not that it stifled democratic debate, but that it denied equal protection to human persons in the womb. I urge the delegates to both the Republican and Democratic conventions to reject their current platforms and adopt language that protects the fundamental, God-given rights all Americans are guaranteed by our Constitution.\n\nThe full passage in the new (draft) RNC platform on abortion and life reads:\n\nWe proudly stand for families and life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process and that the states are, therefore, free to pass laws protecting those rights. After 51 years, because of us, that power has been given to the states and to a vote of the people. We will oppose late-term abortion while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\n\nBy contrast, the 2016 and 2020 RNC platforms said:\n\nThe Constitution's guarantee that no one can \"be deprived of life, liberty or property\" deliberately echoes the Declaration of Independence's proclamation that \"all\" are \"endowed by their Creator\" with the inalienable right to life. Accordingly, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to children before birth.\n\nWe oppose the use of public funds to perform or promote abortion or to fund organizations, like Planned Parenthood, so long as they provide or refer for elective abortions or sell fetal body parts rather than provide healthcare. We urge all states and Congress to make it a crime to acquire, transfer, or sell fetal tissues from elective abortions for research, and we call on Congress to enact a ban on any sale of fetal body parts. In the meantime, we call on Congress to ban the practice of misleading women on so-called fetal harvesting consent forms, a fact revealed by a 2015 investigation. We will not fund or subsidize healthcare that includes abortion coverage.\n\n--\n\nAbout Lila Rose & Live Action - Lila Rose founded and serves as president of Live Action.

The omission of language on a national ban for the first time in 40 years comes as the Republican nominee seeks to appeal to swing voters by downplaying the issue.\n\nThe platform lays out 20 \"promises\" that mirrors Trump's Truth Social posts in its slogans and capitalized letters. It also makes Trump's campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, an official tagline of the Republican party.\n\nThey address immigration, the economy, energy, taxes and crime, but avoids mentioning the word \"abortion\" in any of the key points.\n\nSeveral of the commitments are elaborated on later in the document, but they lack detail on how, exactly, these goals will be feasibly accomplished.\n\nThe RNC vows to \"reverse\" and \"defeat\" inflation, \"unleash American Energy,\" reinstate Trump's \"Deregulation Policies,\" \"SEAL THE BORDER\" and \"restore Peace through Strength\" to bring down prices. It also cements Trump's key campaign promises to make tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips, in order to \"BUILD THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY.\"\n\nImmigration is highlighted with the goals of \"STOP[PING] THE MIGRANT INVASION,\" bringing back Trump's travel ban and beginning the \"Largest Deportation Program in American History\" by strengthening ICE and increasing penalties for illegal entry.\n\nTo address crime, in addition to enforcing immigration laws, the platform calls for using the U.S. Navy to impose a \"full Fentanyl Blockade\" and \"ending the scourge of Illegal Alien gang violence once and for all.\"\n\nThe RNC also puts forth the creation of a \"GREAT IRON DOME MISSILE DEFENSE SHIELD OVER OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY,\" a reference to Israel's short-range missile air defense system. A promise that would come with an astronomical price tag and have minimal capacity to stop the kinds of longer-range threats the U.S. faces.\n\nSocial issues are addressed through several facets. The platform vows to defund schools that engage in \"inappropriate political indoctrination\" and critical race theory, something Trump has long opposed. Instead, the \"First Amendment Right to Pray and Read the Bible in school\" will be championed.\n\nRepublicans will also \"End Left-wing Gender Insanity\" by \"keep[ing] men out of womens' sports, ban[ning] Taxpayer funding for sex changes surgeries, and stop[ping] Taxpayer-funded Schools from promoting gender transition.\"\n\nNotably, the platform only mentions abortion once: \"We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments),\" the document states. This is in line with Trump's rhetoric to leave abortion laws up to the states under the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe document echoes Trump's promise to not makes cuts to Social Security or Medicare, departing from the long-held Republican stance on entitlement benefits.\n\nClimate change is not mentioned.\n\nThe RNC did not release a new platform during the 2020 presidential elections, opting to maintain the 2016 edition due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a RNC resolution.\n\nThe 2024 platform is 50 pages shorter than its predecessor, which came in at 66 pages. It has shifted GOP rhetoric on several fronts.\n\nThe platform's softened stance on abortion has come under scrutiny within the Republican Party. The 2016 and 2020 platforms endorsed a 20-week federal abortion ban, supported a \"human life amendment\" to the Constitution and promised to defund Planned Parenthood. The 2024 version only states that the RNC \"proudly stand[s] for families and life\" and states are \"free to pass laws protecting those rights,\" making no mention of a federal ban.\n\nThe principle of \"traditional marriage and family\" has also been replaced with a broader call for an end to \"Left-wing Gender Insanity.\" Rhetoric against same-sex marriage has also been replaced with opposition toward transgender rights. The 2024 platform advocates for \"keep[ing] men out of women's sports\" and banning \"Taxpayer-funded Schools from promoting gender transition.\"\n\nA stronger stance on practicing religion has been adopted. The new platform explicitly mentions reading the Bible in schools, whereas the 2016-2020 platforms only affirmed the rights of students to \"engage in voluntary prayer at public school events.\"\n\nThe new platform also deviates from past GOP positions on trade and explicitly supports tariffs, which it said will allow \"Taxes on American Workers, Families, and Businesses [to] come down.\"\n\nDespite Trump doubling down on his calls to replace the Affordable Care Act, it appears that the RNC has dropped the idea as no mention of Obamacare is made in the 16-page document. In 2016 and 2020, the RNC had written that \"any honest agenda for improving healthcare must start with the repeal of the dishonestly named Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nThe old platforms called for cuts and reforms to Medicare, including raising the age of eligibility due to \"today's longer life span.\" The 2024 platform also vows to protect Medicare from being \"financially crushed by the Democrat plan to add tens of millions of new illegal immigrants to the rolls of Medicare,\" a false claim as illegal immigrants are not eligible to enroll in federally funded coverage.\n\nThe new platform, both stylistically and substantively, signals Trump's expanding influence over the GOP.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [],

But Democrats are focused instead on a 900-page manifesto by the Heritage Foundation called Project 2025. Which is the best guide to a second Donald Trump term? Plus, NATO holds a summit in Washington, as the alliance steps up on Ukraine aid.\n\nThis transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSpeaker 1: From the Opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal, this is Potomac Watch.\n\nKyle Peterson: The Republican Party releases a 2024 platform document as Donald Trump disavows an outside agenda for his second term, the so-called Project 2025. Meantime, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance gets ready to meet this week in Washington as NATO plans to step up its role in supporting Ukraine's defenders. Welcome. I'm Kyle Peterson with The Wall Street Journal. We are joined today by my colleagues, columnist Kim Strassel and editorial board member Kate Bachelder Odell. The Republican National Convention in Milwaukee is now only one week away, and a last item on the to-do list for Donald Trump is naming his vice presidential running mate. In an interview Monday on Fox News, he said, \"I haven't made a final decision, but I have some ideas as to where we're going.\" So stay tuned for that. But one item that is getting settled in the early days of this week is the GOP's 2024 platform. On Monday, the Republican National Committee moved on a 16-page statement of principles and policies that, Kim, to my eye, looks like it is drafted in Donald Trump's image. There are lines about protecting American workers from unfair trade, no changes to the retirement age, no tax on tips, one of Donald Trump's recent proposals on the campaign trail, the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, and then a line that after Roe v. Wade, power has been given to the states to restrict abortion. Those are a few of the things, Kim, that jumped out to me. What do you make of this platform document and the effect that these platforms have on voters or not anyway?\n\nKim Strassel: The history here is worth going through just because as you note, this is a more Trumpian document, though I would note it would be the first time that that has happened, interestingly. If you go back to 2016, that was the last real time the GOP actually addressed its platform, and at that time at the convention, this was still a moment of upheaval for Donald Trump and Republicans. There was still that big chunk at the 2016 convention that was trying to remove Trump from getting the nomination. So his team was busy with that fight, and as a result, largely left the party delegates to get on with the platform, which they did. And as a result, it was a platform very much in keeping with more past Republican platforms. Then in 2020, because in part of COVID and as there wasn't an in-person convention that year, they just decided to readopt the 2016 platform. So here we are, 2024, and this is the first time Donald Trump's team decided it wanted to have some real input and engagement in the platform writing. And you are right, first thing that I noticed, they have drastically cut its size. The last version was 66 pages, it's now down to 16, and I think that was purposeful, trying to give the Biden team less to work with, less to dig into, and make headlines out of. Very much focused, as you said, on a lot of Trump's priorities in terms of the order that things come out. Obviously, the border is a big one, taxes are a big one, ending inflation and the cost of living are a big part of it, also national security, et cetera. If you really dig into those 16 pages and look at the language, a lot of it is in keeping with prior platforms. Like I said, I think the emphasis is more on Trump's priorities. I would say the biggest changes, you go through abortion, it now, instead of calling for national restriction on abortion, in keeping with the Roe v. Wade decision and what Donald Trump said in that debate, it says it now should be left to the states. There is certainly, on the issues of trade, there's a call for elected officials to adopt Trump's Reciprocal Trade Act, which has to do with tariffs. On foreign affairs, you've got a piece that says that we're now going to call on all of our allies to do more to contribute to their obligations to invest in our common defense. And then there's some things on cryptocurrency, et cetera, which are new ground for the party. What I see when I look at this is a Republican Party that's split the difference on a couple of Trump's key priorities. He's gotten them in there into the platform mostly as a question of emphasis. There have been some small changes but not enough to radically restructure the way Republicans have gone in the past. This is going to be out there, you can bet the Biden team will beat on it. These things don't tend to have a lot of legs or currency in the long run, but it does give a sense of the degree to which Trump's people are exerting new influence within the party in the delegate process.\n\nKyle Peterson: But on the point about giving the opposition some ammunition to work with, for better or worse, much of this in this Republican platform is the kind of stuff that President Trump is saying in his speeches anyway. And when I say, \"Better or for worse,\" on tariffs, for example, I tend to think it's for the worse. But the fact that it's reflecting what Trump is saying out loud in speeches and rallies is part of why, Kate, I think there's this effort to draw more attention by the public to this document called Project 2025. Let's listen to a clip of Chuck Schumer. This is him on the Senate Floor arguing that Donald Trump's real agenda for his second term is this Project 2025.\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer: Over the last few weeks, there's been a whole lot of attention about policy platform drafted by the Heritage Foundation, arguably the most influential conservative think tank in America. The platform in effect is the Trump Manifesto. The project is staffed by over 200 former officials of the Trump presidency and is connected to Trump cabinet members, former campaign advisors, political appointees, and more. And if you read through this Trump Manifesto, it's very clear what the hard right is telling America, \"Put us in power and we will gut America from the inside out.\"\n\nKyle Peterson: And this is Marco Rubio on CNN on Sunday saying this is not a document associated with Donald Trump.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio: Think tanks do think tank stuff. They come up with ideas, they say things. Look, I like Heritage Foundation. I agree with some of the things they stand for, but there's a bunch of scholars and people that turn around and work on different projects. But our candidate for president is Donald Trump and Donald Trump is running on restoring common sense, working-class values, and making our decisions on the basis of that, not on ideological lunacy, which is what we've seen over the last four years under Joe Biden.\n\nDana Bash: Is that what Project 2025 is? Is it ideological lunacy?\n\nSenator Marco Rubio: No, I think it's the work of a tank, of a center-right think tank, and that's what think tanks do.\n\nKyle Peterson: Kate, this Project 2025 document is 922 pages. So to the extent that I can ask you to summarize War and Peace, what is in this agenda and what do you make of it?\n\nKate Bachelder odell: So the Heritage Foundation put out this 900-page document, but they're also, I think, trying to build a Rolodex of staffers who would be available to go into the Trump administration, and then a separate plan about what Trump should focus on in his early days in office. I agree with Rubio that this is typically what think tanks do in trying to drive the policy ideas of the next administration. It's not unique in that regard. It is unique in some of its emphasis. It is an eclectic document with lots of different contributors from different think tanks, and I would call it a mix of good and slightly less-good ideas. It focuses heavily on what conservatives talk about as reigning in the administrative state as getting some of these independent agencies like Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission back under the authority of the executive. It also includes a lot of discrete ideas on economic policies. In some places, it says that the corporate tax rate should be 18% and that the corporate tax rate is the single-most destructive tax in the code, which is notable because there is some Republican movement away from that idea. It is a little more troubling in some areas on national defense. For instance, it says basically that we should prioritize the fight with China, which is, I think, correct, but we have to do that at an affordable cost. It does not, for instance, do what the Heritage Foundation did in the 1980s, which is support Ronald Reagan's buildup of the U.S. military to overtake the Soviet Union. I mention all this, and in some places, Kyle, it doesn't necessarily even provide much of a position. The document includes two essays on trade, one by Peter Navarro, Trump's advisor, and one by another economist who is making the case for lower trade barriers, which I think should carry the day. So it is an eclectic document, a mix of ideas, and I think politically, I understand why Trump is distancing himself from it. It also has a heavy cultural emphasis. When I searched the word abortion, it came up almost 200 times, and Trump of course has been trying to carve out what he thinks is a more electorally defensible stance on the abortion issue. So I see why Trump and Rubio, as his proxy there, are trying to maneuver without associating themselves with the document. And I question whether this will work for progressives, given that most Americans will never have heard of Project 2025 and not have any familiarity with its 900 pages, like those of us who are forced to do this for a living.\n\nKyle Peterson: Hang tight, we'll be right back in a moment. Welcome back. Whether or not most voters by November will have heard about Project 2025, it seems to me that Democrats are expecting that they will run on this as a boogeyman, that they are going to tell voters, \"This is the real Trump agenda. Don't worry about that Republican Party platform. There are 922 pages of this stuff from the Heritage Foundation that you can go look at if you want to get a sense of what the Trump administration would actually do.\" And so it's notable, Kim, that President Trump, Donald Trump the candidate, the guy actually running for office, is distancing himself from this. Here is his Truth Social post on July 5th. Trump says, \"I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.\" And Kim, I guess I have to say I have some sympathy for Donald Trump in saying that because I agree with what Marco Rubio said in that clip we played. Think tanks are free to offer whatever policy ideas, suggestions for an incoming administration that they want, and those policy suggestions can rise or fall on their own merit. But the idea that a think tank can create a 900-page document full of all sorts of details and more or less impose that on the candidate, I don't think washes with how politics works or how government works. And just to provide a sense of the level of detail here, I picked a department more or less at random, the Department of the Interior. And on page 524, this document is saying that, \"The Bureau of Land Management headquarters belongs in the American West.\" There's a whole page and a half about the Bureau of Land Management's policy on wild horses and burros, saying that the BLM's report to Congress included new proposals expanding adoptions and research on new contraceptive techniques, but those are not doing the job, so Congress has to permit the \"BLM to dispose humanely of these animals.\" And Kim, my only thought is that President Trump is going to have some thoughts about most of the stuff in this document, and he's going to hire people to run these agencies who are going to have their own feelings and agendas on a whole range of issues.\n\nKim Strassel: Well, your history on this is absolutely right. Look, it's worth remembering that Heritage has been writing these prescriptive documents for presidents going all the way back to Reagan. They call them their Mandate for Leadership series. Sometimes administrations lean on them more. Back in the Reagan administration, that Heritage document was sort of viewed as a bit of a Bible by some of the people who did work in the Reagan administration, and that's because think tanks were newer on the scene and it was a period of great intellectual thought and ideas generation for the conservative movement, and there were a lot of good ideas. There are good ideas in this current document as well too, but again, different presidents have decided how far they're going to lean on them or not. We had an equivalent, I would note, when Obama was in office. The Center for American Progress was viewed as an ideas factory for the Obama administration. Although I think when you go and look, I mean, they had varied success on how much of it actually made it into policy in the end. I do think that Heritage and other think tanks do see what they hope is a potential opportunity here. What Kate noted about this being not just a document but a bit of a vetting process for people who might go and end up working in this administration to try to get a list of those and to offer training opportunities for them to give them a greater sense and understanding of some of the policy issues out there, that's a big part of this project too. But what Heritage and others looked at is they remember the first Trump administration and one thing that happened, and it probably worked to Trump's benefit, is he hired really quality people who were the department heads in all of these areas and then let them get on with a lot of their agenda. The White House obviously had ultimate veto authority, but they left it to people who were deeply steeped in a lot of policy areas to do what they thought really would be most far-reaching in their departments. So probably that's motivating this a little bit as well. Trump is absolutely right to disavow it because it is true. It's just a document and think tanks do think-tanking, and we'll see what, if any, influence it ultimately has going down the road, but it is remarkable to me the degree to which Democrats are trying to make it central. I mean, that statement from the Biden administration was remarkable, basically saying Trump is lying to you. He's trying to hide his connection to this agenda. It was written for him. It should scare every American. It would give him limitless powers and allow him to take revenge on his enemies. I mean, none of that is really in this document. And again, I totally believe it. I believe that Donald Trump has not read a 900-page policy document from the Heritage Foundation. Okay? So I think he's right to tell the truth in that regard and let everybody know that there will be many other things that are influencing his decisions in office.\n\nKyle Peterson: Hang tight. We'll be right back after one more break. Don't forget, you can reach the latest episode of Potomac Watch anytime. Just ask your smart speaker, \"Play the Opinion Potomac Watch Podcast.\"\n\nSpeaker 1: From the Opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal, this is Potomac watch.\n\nKyle Peterson: Welcome back. Let's turn to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Summit in Washington this week. Kate, we're taping this before the summit begins, but to the extent that the agenda has been signaled in advance, what are the main takeaways that listeners should have about what NATO is up to?\n\nKate Bachelder odell: Well, I think all of the focus has been on Biden's own political prospects and whether he can weather another week of calls for him to drop out of the presidential election, and he seems to see the NATO Summit as an opportunity to show he's still capable of running the country. I think that's unfortunate because I think there is a lot of substance on the docket at the summit this week. Some things that I'm watching for really are about whether the alliance rolls out a new long-term package for Ukraine of military aid. NATO wants to take some of that military aid over and coordinating it and dealing with the international assistance. This has been presented in some quarters as buying an insurance policy against Trump so that NATO can keep funding Ukraine if Trump comes into office. I think that's a huge mistake. I think the reality of the package is that it should be about Europe meeting its commitments to defend Europe over the long haul and showing that Putin's gamble that he can take over Ukraine by just making incremental progress waiting out the West, that that's not going to pay off. So I think the Ukraine package is worth watching, but just one other thing would be whether the allies are willing to revisit their spending commitments. The 2% of GDP marker was agreed to in 2014 to a lot of fanfare. 23 of NATO allies of 32 are on track to meet that commitment in 2024, which is up from three in 2014, but it's clearly the 2% marker is outdated and the world doesn't look like it did in 2014. So the question is whether you could get some momentum to agree to a higher level, closer to 2.5, closer to even 3%. Only about five allies are meeting a 3% marker, and it's basically the Baltic countries who really understand the threat that Russia poses. And then finally, the spending numbers are important, but only if the underlying ability to defend Europe has been fleshed out, and I think NATO has made some progress in recent years organizing its collective defense plans and a better division of labor of, okay, which countries are going to provide which assets to the fight? I know that there's a lot of conventional wisdom that Russia simply doesn't pose a threat to NATO because NATO militaries are so far superior, but that doesn't necessarily mean that Russia couldn't present a huge problem for NATO, particularly in the Baltics and a blitz campaign. I mean, NATO doesn't have a lot of force concentrated on the eastern front. NATO has struggled to keep up with Russian artillery production. So these are the hard topics, I think, that should be the focus of the week's summit more so than Biden's own political prospects.\n\nKyle Peterson: Here's the quote from the NATO Secretary General on the Ukraine shift. He says, \"NATO will take over the coordination and provision of most international security assistance.\" And Kim, I guess I take Kate's point that to the extent that this is being pitched as a Trump-proofing of the Ukraine Defense Assistance Project, it seems to me that that might needlessly inflame President Trump and his supporters. And at this point in the 2024 election campaign, it looks like Donald Trump is probably the favorite to be the next president through 2028, and so maybe NATO does not need that inflaming of the guy who is going to be the commander in chief potentially for the next four years. On the other hand, I do still think there are questions about what Donald Trump's foreign policy is supposed to look like over the next four years, both in Ukraine, but also with regard to NATO, and I would point back to President Trump's debate against President Biden in late June, and he was there on the debate stage bragging again that he was in \"a very secret meeting,\" as he called it, of the 28 states at the time of NATO. And he was asked whether he would defend them and Trump bragged again that he said, \"No, if you don't pay, I won't do that.\" And so Kim, I still do think there's a potential vulnerability for him here in that voters who are worried about the chaos of the Trump years returning, that that sounds like Donald Trump hasn't necessarily backed off that idea.\n\nKim Strassel: Well, to the NATO point, this was a silly move on their part, both by NATO leadership, but by European heads and delegates that are leaking this notion to the press that they are baking in these commitments as an insurance policy against the Donald Trump presidency. This is not the way you go about courting the potential would-be next leader of the United States who is so central to your organization. They should be doing what they can to build those bridges and maintain good relations with a possible future president, especially because Trump has expressed some skepticism. Now, let me put it this way when it comes to Trump. I think Donald Trump's threats that he makes and the fact that he has leaked those have been in aid of him trying to broadcast that he got results. And we can't ignore that there has been a change and a change for the better, given the pressure that he did put on NATO. If you go back to 2014, there were only three countries that were making that 2% commitment, and now we're approaching 23 of the 32. I agree with Kate, that number needs to be even higher, and those are the unknown questions for Trump. I think what he has broadcast pretty clearly is that his main interest is that NATO step up and fulfill its commitments, and that assuming it does, he's a huge fan of this alliance and understands its importance. He needs to be far more clear about his views on that, about his views of European common defence, our role in it, and the Ukraine conflict, and how he views this new, unsettled world now that Putin's aggression and China too, that was another. I think it's going to be an important part of this NATO conversation is there was a recognition going into this that China is the main financial backer of Russia's war, and that puts China very much more on NATO's radar. All of those things Donald Trump needs to be a lot more clear about, but playing politics this early in the game before he's made that clarity, I think, is damaging to the organization.\n\nKyle Peterson: Kate, we'll give you the last word, but perhaps President Trump does deserve some credit for more NATO members meeting that 2% target. On the other hand, there's a lot that has happened since 2014, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which seems to have really put the fear of God into some of these countries, particularly in Eastern Europe.\n\nKate Bachelder odell: Where I think Trump deserves credit on this issue is that he did identify a salient issue early, which was that the Europeans were not meeting their defense commitments. However, I do think when you look at the data, it's pretty clear that what spurred Europe to change its behavior really was Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. I mean, an example from today's editorial, the Dutch we're spending 1.3% of its economy on defense in 2021. I mean, that's a pitiful number. It's not even close to 2%. They're now set to eke out 2.05% in 2024. So it's very obviously Putin's aggression that's driving this change. I think there was a lot of thinking in Europe that, \"Well, Putin wouldn't really roll in tanks to Kyiv. He would launch a hybrid war. He'd do a more minor military action.\" And so I think to have a basically World War I artillery land war in Eastern Europe has changed the dynamics in Europe. I think Trump can still point out that this has been an issue of his for a while, and he can capitalize on that issue. I think, for instance, he's been thinking about rolling out a 3% marker for NATO allies, and I think that would be a decent challenge to issue to allies at this point. Well, the 2% marker was not fit for a China-Russia-Iran axis that's challenging the U.S. and other Western nations across multiple theaters. And to Kim, I think connecting those dots is correct, that what's going on in the Pacific is increasingly NATO's problem if you have China bankrolling and helping Putin's invasion. So I think there's opportunity for Trump to take the political opening here, but I think it's unfortunate that he keeps retreating to these reckless remarks about how, \"Well, if you don't pay, I won't defend you.\" I don't think that's how he will get the high ground from this. And I also think Biden has a lot of vulnerabilities. He gets a lot of credit for uniting NATO after the Ukraine invasion, but he doesn't get enough criticism for how he's handled the Ukraine war, for what he did in the run-up to the invasion, that withdrawing from Afghanistan, calling it a potential minor incursion. I mean, there's a lot of vulnerability there that Trump hopefully will truly go after if he wants to win on this issue.\n\nKyle Peterson: Thank you, Kate. Thank you, Kim. Thank you all for listening.

Some liberal journalists - the opinion-makers of what has been called the Democrats' \"shadow party\" - dismissed the new platform as a \"joke\". They're wrong. The Republican party platform is scary. Not because it rolls out the usual litany of conservative policy preferences, but precisely because of where it breaks from that orthodoxy.\n\nThe new party platform is scary, because it can win.\n\nRemember, the Republican party did not release a platform in 2020. Presumably, many in the party had not yet accepted that Trumpism was not an aberrant virus but instead the new normal for conservative politics. But in 2024 party leaders, billionaire donors, and rightwing media have embraced Donald Trump without reservation. The new platform reflects his political formula: moderate, at least rhetorically, on abortion; double down on immigration; and reject the small-government Republican tradition.\n\nIn addition to the ex-president's signature anti-immigrant positions, consider the following changes: the drafters have dropped the party's longstanding commitment to cut \"entitlements\" and now say that Republicans \"will not cut one penny\" from social security or Medicare. The platform also does not mention reducing the national debt, opting instead for vague language about slashing \"wasteful spending\". The platform endorses an industrial policy to make the US the \"Manufacturing Superpower\". The platform rails against the \"unfair trade deals\" and politicians who \"sold our jobs and livelihoods to the highest bidders overseas\". And there is a new commitment to \"rebuild our cities and restore law and order\".\n\nMost strikingly, the platform does not mention any national abortion ban, only opposition to \"late-term abortion\". The platform describes itself as \"a return to common sense\" and Trump has distanced himself from the radical framing of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.\n\nIn US politics, platforms typically don't mean much, and both Democrats and Republicans tend to throw together broad programs designed to triangulate between appeasing ideologues and appealing to swing voters. But platforms can be consequential if they signal a genuine break from past orthodoxy, and if legislators take them seriously. Given the sudden advocacy of platform positions from several leading Republican figures such as JD Vance and Marco Rubio, the new Republican platform does not seem like window dressing.\n\nThis is the new core of the Republican party's appeals: moderate on certain cultural issues and economic issues. That can win against a feeble Democratic party that is too busy wrestling over who their nominee should be to promote a second-term agenda. (\"Let's Finish the Job\" says Joe Biden, in a recent ad, with no indication what that job is.)\n\nDemocrats seem to have tricked themselves into thinking that the voting public's general rejection of the US supreme court's Dobbs decision means that polarization around abortion will catapult them to victory. They seem to think that because Ron DeSantis lost by making his campaign all about \"wokeness\", voters really don't mind corporate DEI language. They seem to think that because the Republican party is unwilling to follow through on the populist economics presented in their 2016 and 2024 platforms, voters will laugh off those promises. And, of course, they underestimate the degree to which inflation has soured voters on the president and the Democrats.\n\nMuch was made in the lead-up to 2016 about the civil war within the Republican party between \"Never Trump\" conservatives and the Steve Bannon populist wing of the party. Moderate figures like Joe Scarborough and Colin Powell left the party in opposition to their presumptive candidate, while Marco Rubio said that Trump's nomination would \"fracture the party and be damaging to the conservative movement\". Far from crippling the Republican party, however, Trump brought it back to power. And in office, he reassured establishment figures by coupling largely symbolic protectionist measures with the deregulation and tax cuts for the wealthy that one would have expected from a Mitt Romney administration.\n\nAnd now, instead of moving the Republican party to the radical right, Trump, on key issues like abortion, is at least theoretically moving his party closer to the center. Indeed, the Republican platform appears to be a winning one. Yet while the Republican party is offering a relatively coherent program, Democrats are all over the place, with a nominee unable to effectively communicate with the American people and no unifying theme other than opposition to Trump. Rather than running on the Biden administration's oversight of job growth in distressed areas and its new industrial policy, liberals seem content to do battle on the cultural front.\n\nThis discursive failing has allowed common sense policies that are more reflective of the governing practice of today's Democratic party - from defending the social safety net to growing manufacturing jobs - to become rebranded as the bread-and-butter of the Republican party.\n\nIn power, it's likely that Trump will once again betray his working-class supporters and govern like a typical business conservative, because he is utterly committed to more tax cuts and weakening trade unions. He's promised his richest political donors whatever they want if they help him get back in power. As a result, we've seen billionaires lining up to shower him with cash.\n\nYet Trump has displayed surprising political discipline lately. While the Democrats bicker among themselves about Biden's fitness, Trump is only now beginning to spend big money in swing states like Wisconsin - where he is already leading in the polls.\n\nThis is a side of Trump we haven't previously seen; he is campaigning to win in a dangerously coherent way. If progressives don't wake up and offer an appealing alternative, Trump might do more than rule through the courts and through executive orders - he might forge a long-lasting, majoritarian movement.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bhaskar_sunkara@theguardian.com", "name": "Bhaskar Sunkara", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trumpism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Libertarian conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The finalized document leans into former President Donald Trump's \"America First\" outlook and parrots many of his stances on issues ranging from immigration to trade. However, it also minimized the party's emphasis on gun policy compared to its previous platform.\n\nThe entire platform discusses gun rights just once, in a preamble statement about the party's dedication to defending \"our fundamental freedoms, including freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to keep and bear arms.\" The final product omits any discussion of tangible gun policy ideas.\n\nThe Republican Party platform's downplaying of Second Amendment issues comes as the gun-rights movement finds itself in a precarious position politically. As guns have become increasingly polarized along party lines, gun-rights supporters have found themselves reliant on Republicans for political support. President Joe Biden has made gun control a fixture of his tenure in office and is already campaigning on even more sweeping proposals, including a ban on sales of the popular AR-15, in a potential second term. At the same time, while the GOP's current standard-bearer has continued to seek the support of the National Rifle Association and make promises in speeches to the group, he has been fickle on gun policy at times. His felony convictions also mean he can no longer legally own or possess firearms.\n\nThe 2024 platform's cursory discussion of gun policy priorities marks a significant departure from the party's 2016 platform. The party previously dedicated an entire section to the Second Amendment. In it, the GOP listed specific pro-gun policies it wanted to enact, as well as gun-control measures it opposed.\n\n\"We support firearm reciprocity legislation to recognize the right of law-abiding Americans to carry firearms to protect themselves and their families in all 50 states,\" the 2016 document reads. \"We support constitutional carry statutes and salute the states that have passed them.\"\n\n\"We oppose ill-conceived laws that would restrict magazine capacity or ban the sale of the most popular and common modern rifle,\" the section continues. \"We also oppose any effort to deprive individuals of their right to keep and bear arms without due process of law. We condemn frivolous lawsuits against gun manufacturers and the current Administration's illegal harassment of firearm dealers. We oppose federal licensing or registration of law-abiding gun owners, registration of ammunition, and restoration of the ill-fated Clinton gun ban.\"\n\nThe RNC did not respond to a request for comment about the party dropping gun-rights priorities from its platform. However, in a press release, RNC Chairman Michael Whatley and co-chair Lara Trump called the \"a bold roadmap that will undo the devastating damage that Joe Biden's far-left policies have done to this country, power President Trump to a historic victory in November, and Make America Great Again.\"\n\nThe GOP's old platform stood in stark contrast to the 2020 Democratic party platform, which dedicated several paragraphs to endorsing gun-control proposals aimed at \"Ending the Epidemic of Gun Violence.\"\n\n\"Democrats will enact universal background checks, end online sales of guns and ammunition, close dangerous loopholes that currently allow stalkers, abusive partners, and some individuals convicted of assault or battery to buy and possess firearms, and adequately fund the federal background check system,\" the 2020 platform reads. \"Democrats will ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We will incentivize states to enact licensing requirements for owning firearms and extreme risk protection order laws that allow courts to temporarily remove guns from the possession of those who are a danger to themselves or others.\"\n\nThe GOP's 2024 platform being nearly silent on gun policy was not the only instance of the party leaning away from its traditional issues and stances. The updated platform also featured notably softened language on abortion restrictions, a move that reflects former President Trump's recent sidelining of the pro-life movement. While the party's 2016 platform endorsed a federal abortion ban after 20 weeks, the updated document codified Trump's preference to leave the issue to the states. It also endorsed protections for birth control and fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nThe updated platform also removed the party's previous opposition to same-sex marriage, its emphasis on reducing the national debt, and its vision for entitlements reform. Instead, the platform explicitly called for the complete protection of Social Security and Medicare without any cuts or retirement age adjustments, a longtime Trump priority.\n\nThe Trump campaign celebrated the final draft of the platform and emphasized the former President's personal influence on its contents.\n\n\"President Trump's 2024 Republican Party Platform articulates his vision to Make America Great Again in a way that is concise and digestible for every voter,\" Trump Campaign Senior Advisors Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a press release. \"While Joe Biden and Democrats argue about who will be at the top of their ticket and have implemented policies that have raised prices on everyday families, opened the floodgates to migrant crime via wide-open borders, shackled American energy with red tape forced by Washington bureaucrats, and sewn chaos across the world through weak foreign policy, President Trump will Make America Great Again through these America First principles.\"\n\nThe 2024 platform will officially be adopted by the party at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week.", "source": {"uri": "freedomsphoenix.com",

The document, dedicated \"To the Forgotten Men and Women of America,\" makes clear -- as if there were any doubt at this point -- that this is Trump's party now and is much different compared with just eight years ago. The platform \"cements Mr. Trump's ideological takeover of the G.O.P.,\" The New York Times reports. \"The platform is even more nationalistic, more protectionist and less socially conservative than the 2016 Republican platform.\"\n\nTrump wrote and edited some parts of the platform himself, CNN reports.\n\nNews reports about the policy framework have focused largely on its softening the GOP's position on abortion rights in keeping with Trump's recently adopted stance that defers to the states, or its elimination of earlier references to \"traditional marriage\" as being between \"one man and one woman,\" or its promise to launch the largest deportation program in the nation's history.\n\nBut the platform also highlights the Republican Party's shifting positions on a range of fiscal matters. Gone is any reference to the national debt and budget deficits. The party's 66-page platform from 2016 referenced the debt 10 times. The new platform includes only a promise to rein in \"wasteful spending\" as part of a list of steps meant to tackle inflation.\n\nThe document's single page specifically dedicated to building \"the greatest economy in history\" promises to cut regulations and make permanent the 2017 Trump tax law provisions that \"doubled the standard deduction, expanded the Child Tax Credit, and spurred Economic Growth for all Americans.\" It also pledges to eliminate taxes on tips, an idea Trump embraced recently, and to pursue additional tax cuts.\n\nIn another shift away from conservative orthodoxy, the platform says that Trump \"has made absolutely clear that he will not cut one penny from Medicare or Social Security,\" a contrast with the 2016 platform, which said that \"all options should be considered to preserve Social Security.\" The new platform specifies that no changes will be made to the retirement age. It pledges that Republicans will \"ensure the long-term sustainability of Social Security\" and protect Medicare from what it baselessly describes as a \"Democrat plan to add tens of millions of new illegal immigrants to the rolls.\"\n\nWhy it matters: Republicans have long talked about restoring fiscal responsibility only to add to the debt when in power. The Trumpified party platform is now officially ditching even the talking points, much to the dismay of debt and deficit hawks.\n\n\"Ever since the party was taken over by Donald Trump, Republicans have backed away from speaking of debt reduction as an important goal -- even as the situation has deteriorated,\" writes Philip Klein at the conservative National Review. \"Now, they have made that fiscal irresponsibility part of their official platform.\"\n\nThe platform has additional political significance for Trump. It was released at a time when he has been trying to distance himself from \"Project 2025,\" a conservative plan overseen by the Heritage Foundation detailing a sweeping agenda for overhauling the government in a second Trump term.\n\nHeritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts drew new attention to the plan when he said in a recent interview that the United States is \"in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.\"\n\nMany of those involved in the plan served in the first Trump administration and are expected to play key roles in government should the former president be re-elected in November, though the group also sought to separate itself from the Trump campaign. \"As we've been saying for more than two years now, Project 2025 does not speak for any candidate or campaign.

Why Mecklenburg GOP sees chance for Trump to win Charlotte votes", "body": "With the right strategy, former President Donald Trump could make inroads with Charlotte-area voters at the Republican National Convention, local delegates and political strategists say.\n\nThe GOP will gather in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, next week to officially nominate Trump as he looks to unseat Democratic incumbent Joe Biden, if Biden stays in the race. The party released its official platform Monday, and it includes no call for a nationwide abortion ban for the first time in 40 years. Other planks include calls to \"seal the border,\" end inflation and cut taxes.\n\nBoth campaigns are vying to win over voters in the swing state's most populous metropolitan area, where Republicans say they want to see a focus on issues including the economy, public safety and national security.\n\nAnd they see a window after Biden's debate performance that raised questions about his viability as a candidate.\n\n\"Republicans need to be strategic with appealing to voters on common sense solutions,\" said delegate Sarah Reidy-Jones.\n\nThe convention is an opportunity for Trump's campaign to \"set the agenda for the voters,\" said Chris Cooper, a political science professor at Western Carolina University.\n\n\"If the Republicans are successful, they will set an agenda based on issues where people trust them and trust them more than the Democratic Party and the Democratic candidates,\" he said.\n\nLocal Republican strategist Larry Shaheen summed up his view of the convention in five words: \"It's Project Don't Look Crazy.\"\n\nMecklenburg Republicans: Trump can gain ground here\n\nReidy-Jones, who chaired the Mecklenburg GOP from 2021 to 2023, noted voters in and around Charlotte are \"no stranger to being courted during presidential years.\" Mecklenburg County reliably votes blue, but its large population means it's also one of the state's largest sources of Republican votes. And many of its more suburban areas and surrounding counties have more GOP-friendly electorates.\n\nBiden won Mecklenburg by a margin of 66.7% to 31.6% in 2020, and Hilary Clinton beat Trump in the county with 62.3% of the vote in 2016. But wins in counties such as Cabarrus, Iredell and Union helped propel Trump to statewide victories in both elections.\n\nReidy-Jones is hoping her party will use the convention to share its approach to inflation, border security, public safety and school choice: issues she believes will appeal to undecided voters in her community. The Republican platform calls for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, a new missile defense system and for schools to lose federal funding if they teach \"Critical Race Theory, radical gender ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content.\"\n\n\"As the target demographic of a suburban soccer mom, I've personally felt the pressures of these issues. I worry about putting food on my table, feeling safe in my own neighborhood and have witnessed first-hand a failing school system,\" she said. \"My husband and I are having the same conversations as others here: are we better off than we were four years ago? And it's a no. Voters want to feel like relief is coming.\"\n\nDelegate Rion Choate, a longtime Trump supporter from Charlotte, says the former president can connect with Mecklenburg voters by talking about taxes, voter ID laws and national security issues in Ukraine, North Korea and China.\n\nThe 2024 Republican platform calls for \"large tax cuts for workers\" and voter ID requirements. Trump became the first sitting president to visit North Korea in 2019. He's repeatedly said on the campaign trail he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\"We need to get back to America first,\" Choate said.\n\nThe 2024 Republican platform could be a launching pad for connecting with voters in the Charlotte area \"that have been alienated\" by Trump but aren't fully committed to the Democratic ticket, Larry Shaheen said.\n\n\"This platform is designed to appeal to the moderate folks in the suburbs,\" he said.\n\nCan platform change on abortion help Trump?\n\nThe change in language on abortion in the platform, which the Associated Press reported was driven by Trump, is an example of the party trying to market itself to \"those voters who we may have lost,\" Shaheen said. North Carolina Democrats have spotlighted abortion as a campaign issue after that proved to be a winning strategy for the party in other states since Roe v. Wad was overturned.\n\n\"There are a lot of Republicans like me who are actually relieved to see him take that issue potentially off the table,\" he said.\n\nCooper said the abortion change is a sign Trump's campaign doesn't feel the issue is \"electorally advantageous\" for Republicans.\n\n\"Could that make a difference in a state like North Carolina? Sure,\" he said of the change. \"If the state is as close as we expect it to be, or at least as close as it's been in the last few cycles, then not leaning into abortion I think is a very smart strategy for the Republican Party and for Donald Trump in particular.\"\n\nReidy-Jones said she thinks the pivot on abortion reflects the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which \"placed this issue back into the states' hands.\"\n\n\"We need to be focused on showing what strengths we would have with a Trump presidency over a Biden presidency,\" she said of abortion as a campaign issue. \"Including stronger national security, safer streets, and a stop to inflation that is affecting every household.\"\n\nHow much do conventions matter?\n\nAs conventions have become more choreographed coronations rather than floor fights over who should be a party's nominee, they've also become \"less important\" in swaying voters, Cooper noted. Still, he added, they present \"essentially a free advertisement for the political party.\"\n\n\"You're not going to persuade a whole lot of people, but you could set the agenda for the media,\" he said. \"You can set the agenda for the voters.\"\n\nHe predicted Republicans will likely see the typical \"small bounce\" in polling after their convention.\n\n\"The reason I call it a bounce instead of a bump is that bounces come back down, and that's what we tend to see now with conventions,\" he said.\n\nShaheen said recent turmoil on the Democratic side, where Biden has been plagued with questions about his age and health, presents Republicans with an opportunity to make more of a splash with their convention than normal.\n\nRepublicans would be wise to present a \"counter image\" to \"the Democrats who are disastrously in disarray,\" he said.\n\n\"If the Republicans stay on message -- one that's going to try to appeal to suburban voters and voters in urban centers -- they have an opportunity to vault ahead and potentially build up a lead,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who served as chair of the platform committee, said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily.\n\nBlackburn addressed concerns from some of the pro-life crowd, as the list of 20 promises in the Republican Party platform did not include anything about the pro-life cause. However, Blackburn said it is absolutely mentioned in the 16-page document, assuring that the Republican Party is the party of life.\n\nRELATED -- March for Life Participant to Republicans Avoiding Standing for Life: If You Stay Silent, \"That's on You\"\n\n\"The Republican Party is a pro-life party. It's a pro-family party. It is always going to be that,\" she said, explaining that the party platform is not an \"in-depth, long form missive.\"\n\n\"This is something, as I said, it's a total of 16 pages, and it is a promise that these are the things that we are going to do. One of the items in the chapter about government ... and bear in mind, the chapters are really short -- they're not even a page long -- and one of them is to continue to protect life,\" Blackburn said. She emphasized that protecting life is a \"promise that the Republican Party makes.\"\n\n\"And that is something they've always fulfilled, and they will continue to fulfill. I'll actually read it. It's one short paragraph,\" she said, reading the position in the document:\n\nWe proudly stand for families and life. We believe that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantees that no person can be denied life or liberty without due process, and that the states are therefore free to pass laws protecting those rights. After 51 years because of us, that power has been given to the state and to a vote of the people. We will oppose late term abortion while supporting mothers and policies that advance prenatal care, access to birth control, and IVF.\n\nLISTEN:\n\nBlackburn reminded listeners that this document is a quite different from the 2016 platform, noting that it is intended to be easily digestible and user-friendly.\n\n\"This is a good document. I encourage everybody to read it and then to work with us to elect Republicans from your local, state, and federal levels,\" she added, noting the entire platform is dedicated to the \"forgotten men and women of America.\"\n\nBreitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_knudsen@breitbart.com", "name": "Hannah Knudsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marsha Blackburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_for_Life_(Washington,_D.C.)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "March for Life (Washington, D.C.)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_values", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family values"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM_Patriot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM Patriot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/Marsha-Blackburn-getty.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716769", "eventUri": "eng-9716769", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide to set abortion policies tailored to the politics of each state.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNew store opens at Southlake Mall Golden Corral in Merrillville reopens after closing in 2020 after then-franchisee's cold case arrest for Missouri murder Judge rejects plea in domestic shooting; man threatens to throw chair at judge Region coffee shop employee empties registers in IRS phone scam, police say 18-year-old dies in car crash on Fourth of July in Portage, police said NWI Business Ins and Outs: Taco Pros, Brass Idol, Red Zone Sports Bar, Windy City Pizza Kitchen, Sweet Circle, Starbucks, Alexander McQueen and Caribbean Roots opening; Evvy's Coffee and Deep Blue Seafood closing Dispensaries stacking up on Michigan border despite weed remaining illegal in Indiana Inmate dies at Porter County Jail, police say Wrecking ball comes for St. Margaret's Hospital in downtown Hammond Cedar Lake man found dead while sitting in a pond, police say Hobart roundabout moving to phase two Church's much-anticipated Harvest Square Strip Mall to have ribbon-cutting, bring 'services of suburbs' to Gary $80 million Palace Theatre redevelopment billed as biggest investment in downtown Gary in 50 years Exterior of Region home found on fire early Friday, large response reported Twisted Sugar opens in Schererville Friday\n\nIn response, Pence said in a statement issued through his Advancing American Freedom organization that \"now is not the time to surrender any ground in the fight for the right to life.\"\n\n\"The right to life is not only a state issue; it is a moral issue, and our party must continue to speak with moral clarity and compassion about advancing the cause of life at the federal, state and local level,\" Pence said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not return the question of abortion to the states only but to the elected representatives of the people. Every life, born and unborn, is precious and deserving of their rights endowed by their Creator. The 14th Amendment, though rightly cited (in the proposed GOP platform), will not protect the unborn across the country without further federal action.\"\n\nTrump has taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped repeal Roe v. Wade. But he's also sought to distance himself from abortion issues after voters in numerous states overturned or rejected near-total abortion bans like the one in effect in Indiana, where Hoosier voters are not permitted to overrule at the ballot box actions taken by the Legislature.\n\nPence said he views such steps as symptomatic of \"a broader retreat in our party -- trying to remain vague for political expedience.\"\n\n\"Beyond the politics of the issue is the immorality of ending an unborn human life. We must never lose the moral clarity to say that abortion is wrong. The GOP platform may be retreating, but we in the pro-life movement never will. We will continue to be a people of life, and we will not rest or relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in our land,\" Pence said.\n\nRepublican delegates still can alter the party platform during the national convention in Milwaukee. Though it's unclear how many will risk appearing disloyal to Trump by advocating for a policy favored by Pence, who notably broke with Trump when the president pressured Pence to exceed his authority during the Jan. 6, 2021, electoral vote count that confirmed Trump's 2020 electoral defeat.\n\nPence, nevertheless, remains hopeful: \"My fellow Republicans, stand firm for life. Restore the RNC platform's historic commitment to the sanctity of human life. Pro-life Americans and generations born and unborn deserve nothing less.\"\n\nPhotos: Mike Pence through the years\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nDan Carden\n\nChief Political Reporter\n\nFollow Dan Carden\n\nClose Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nSave\n\nManage followed notifications\n\nClose Followed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature Log In\n\nDon't have an account?

We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments).\"\n\nWhile many said this is a big change for the party, Proto disagrees.\n\n\"It really isn't a policy shift and I know there are some folks in Connecticut who are calling it a retreat from the position, and it's not,\" he said. \"It's actually a restatement of the position the Republican Party has held for over 50 years, which was, we believe that Roe was wrongly decided, that it's an issue for the states.\"\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Gov. Ned Lamont had some strong words about the presumptive GOP nominee Tuesday.\n\n\"If Donald Trump Republicans took the House, the Senate, the Supreme Court and the presidency, bonnie bar the door,\" said Lamont. \"You may not recognize this country in four years.\"\n\nTrump and his team have also been working to separate themselves from Project 25 -- a controversial roadmap for the next Republican administration, crafted by the Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe plan makes calls to overhaul the federal government -- firing as many as 50,000 government employees -- and expand presidential powers.\n\nSome of Trump's closest advisors are tied to Project 2025 and he has posted on social media saying some of the ideas are \"very good.\"\n\nMORE NEWS:\n\nNew poll shows where Americans stand on abortion access\n\nBiden tells Hill Democrats he won't step aside amid party drama: 'It's time for it to end'", "source": {"uri": "fox61.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fox61.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_wulfhorst@fox61.com", "name": "Emma Wulfhorst", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Republican_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Republican Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

For the delegates, who were sideswiped by the unconventional, fast-tracked, secret process, the entire morning felt surreal. The outcome was so pre-determined, so tightly controlled that most of the men and women who traveled from the furthest corners of the country wondered what they were even doing there.\n\nWhile the RNC's team and the Trump camp cheered the adoption of a platform they vowed would Make America Great Again, the mood on the ground wasn't all that celebratory. It wasn't just the outcome that was disturbing, \"Washington Watch\" guest host and former Congressman Jody Hice pointed out from Wisconsin, but also \"how it all went down.\"\n\nBrent Keilen, FRC Action's vice president for Strategic Initiatives, was a guest in the proceedings and saw with his own eyes how different the situation was from 2016. Typically, he pointed out, the process of adopting and amending the Republican platform takes at least two days. There are usually five or six subcommittees devoted to certain aspects of the document. They sit down, Keilen explained, and say, \"Okay, let's analyze this. Let's have some good discussion just to make sure [nothing's being] left out.\" Incredibly, though, in a major break with tradition, there were no subcommittees at all.\n\nLifeNews is on GETTR. Please follow us for the latest pro-life news\n\nIn fact, Brent said, \"There were delegates going to the mic and saying, 'Hey, I actually thought I was going to be part of a subcommittee process first. What's going on there?'\" The whole thing happened \"extremely fast,\" he underscored -- despite the fact that delegates weren't given the platform language \"until literally\" they sat down that morning. \"They didn't have a chance to read it beforehand,\" and then immediately they were forced to vote on it. \"Many of them traveled [a long way]. ... They spend a lot of time [and] energy to get here,\" and frankly, Keilen said, they never got a say in what was adopted.\n\nHice, who spent a lot of years in Congress, pointed out that \"one of the things that aggravated my constituents -- and I think Republican voters all across the country, as much as anything else -- was when we would get a 1,500 piece of [legislation] two or three hours before we're voting on it, where none of us had time to read up, but we didn't know what was in it. And we always gripe about [former Speaker] Nancy Pelosi's famous comment of 'Pass it and then find out what's in it.' But ... it sounds very much like that's what took place even today in the platform.\"\n\nThat, many said, coupled with the secrecy of the whole event and the abandonment of longtime pro-life principles, rubbed plenty of delegates the wrong way. Gayle Ruzicka, a platform committee member from Utah, told Politico that the RNC staff \"didn't allow\" a discussion on the language the platform used on abortion. \"They didn't even give us a chance to read it before we voted on it,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm very frustrated,\" Ruzicka admitted. \"I think we were treated very poorly. We spent a lot of money to get here. We were supposed to have the opportunity to study it and read it. We didn't get even a chance to read it first,\" Ruzicka said. \"They gave it to us, but we kept waiting to go to our committee and then they didn't ever do committees.\"\n\nFRC's Travis Weber, who was also at the committee meeting, found it ironic that Republicans were vowing to fight censorship in their document while conducting the platform with an \"iron fist.\" \"You can't even sit there and talk about free speech when the process [was] conducted that way. It needs to be called out and reckoned.\" This should be an open forum \"with input, with collaboration,\" Weber insisted. \"None of that was present. ... The RNC wanted to retain a tight control on things and stop that.\"\n\nAnd what do you get when you silence people, he asked rhetorically? \"You get ... a frustrated group of people who are not feeling heard in a process in which they should feel heard. So that was very clear. I think it was a missed opportunity. And it was very disappointing because no one's fooling anyone. Everyone knows when someone is trying to ram something down their throat, and it was very clear that this was being rammed down the throats of everyone there today.\"\n\nIf you asked most delegates, Travis said frankly, \"it made a mockery of the people who were selected to go here.\" And to be fair, he continued, \"There [are] some good things in this document. I think you'd actually have more people rallying around it if they didn't feel so stepped on and disrespected in this entire process.\"\n\nOf course, one of the reasons for stiff-arming delegates was the Trump team's desire, along with the RNC's, to water down the 1,300-plus words of pro-life priorities in the 2016/2020 document. As the former president's advisors admitted to the press, they were worried the abortion language would create too much \"drama.\" And while a handful of pro-life groups accepted the 90 words in exchange for continued access to Trump, FRC Action Chairman Tony Perkins refused to accept the gutted plank. \"I cannot compromise biblical truth to advance a temporal political objective. I won't do it,\" he told Hice on \"Washington Watch\" Monday. \"I just can't do it.\"\n\nGathering together as many delegates as he could, the FRC Action chairman put together a minority report to RNC leadership, expressing their deep disappointment with the way the committee bypassed the process and the 112 representatives' views. Planting a flag in the ground that was so quickly surrendered, more than 20 delegates wrote, in part:\n\n\"Today we observe the vitality of a more recent but analogous set of commitments, embodied most prominently in the promise of the Republican Party to preserve the right to life of every human being from conception to natural death. That commitment made its way into the platform of 1976, twelve decades after that original session in Philadelphia. That commitment to a human life amendment and a call for the Fourteenth Amendment's protection application to children before birth has been repeated in every platform since and, by this declaration of principle, we extend it now.\n\n\"In no season, under no rationale spurred by the exigencies of a political moment, can or should we abandon the high principles that have created and sustained this party, with God's grace, into a third century.\n\n\"In the coming years, we pledge ourselves to continue to work for the good of every child, every parent, and every family. We rededicate ourselves to the core policy positions endorsed through deliberation and transparency with ever-increasing clarity in previous platforms, with respect to the funding of abortion domestically and internationally, the expansion of alternatives to abortion, support for credits for adoption and all children, ending the exploitation of embryonic human beings, and above all recognizing the application of 14th amendment protections to our developing offspring. These are issues for the ages and not for any single cycle in our national life.\n\n\"With heaviness of heart but fullness of optimism that the defense of life will inevitably prevail, we resubmit these ideals to our fellow Americans. As before, we do fondly hope and fervently pray that the scourge of abortion will speedily pass away, and to that end we renew our perpetual devotion and ceaseless labor to the cause of life.\"\n\nOther conservative leaders felt similarly betrayed by the hollowed out platform. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), mid-speech at NatCon, expressed dismay at the hijacking of the process in Milwaukee. \"As we speak, the Republican Party is dropping family and life from its platform. And we wonder why it lost the last elections. Work. Family. God. These are the great loves that unite Americans. Republicans need to start defending these loves.\"\n\nPrinceton's McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence Robby George blasted those so tempted to accept these empty words in exchange for remaining in the 45th president's good graces. \"Pro-life leaders ... will be tempted to go along with this without public complaint in order to retain some standing and influence in the future Trump administration. They may even claim that it is somehow a victory. In truth, it's the opposite of that,\" he posted candidly on Facebook.\n\n\"It is true that the thoroughly transactional Donald Trump appointed justices who provided the votes necessary to overturn Roe v. Wade. He kept his bargain with the pro-life movement on that one. But now Mr. Trump sees our cause -- the protection of unborn children -- as a political liability. He knows that seriously pro-life people cannot in conscience vote for Joe Biden and the Democrats, so he has no reason not to throw the pro-life cause under the bus. And, predictably, that is what he had now done.\"\n\nChad Connelly, who made headlines for being summarily booted from his delegate position for being \"too conservative, too Christian, too pro-life\" the week before the platform committee, told Hice that \"This cake was baked. [The RNC] had a desire to ... steamroll.\" Look, he pointed out, \"Everybody I know realizes the country can't take four more years of Joe Biden. At the same time, the process matters, the platform matters.\"\n\nThe CEO of Faith Wins mentioned that \"over a thousand pastors from all over the country\" have contacted him concerned about the outcome with \"disappointment, betrayal, shock.\" \"I took, I don't know, over a dozen phone calls yesterday from concerned pastors who were now like, 'What do we do? And how do we handle this?' ... Most pastors don't endorse, but they do want to have a platform they can stand by...\"\n\nAt the end of the day, they -- like so many conservatives -- understand that this is a document that transcends any one election. \"No one in there is opposing the president,\" Weber reiterated. \"They're just seeking to be honored and respected and around the table. ... We're raising concerns because we have to be honest. We cannot ignore things that we believe are essential for the flourishing of our nation. ... But we're going to continue to engage, to highlight the issues that we believe are essential [because] ... it's not about us,\" he insisted. \"... It's about being a blessing to the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "lifenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_ertelt@lifenews.com", "name": "Steven Ertelt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Research_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family Research Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jody_Hice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jody Hice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Perkins_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Perkins (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Connelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chad Connelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscience_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conscience vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

It is much worse than that.\n\nWhile Donald Trump's most ardent supporters project their hopes on the big man to make America great again, it appears the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is on a mission to have his most notorious acronym stand for \"make America gay again.\"\n\nAt a time when poll after poll shows that Republican voters (and many independents) have increasingly soured on the absurd idea of gay marriage, a 16-page draft of the new party platform circulated on Monday by the Trump campaign to platform committee members completely erases the party's opposition to gay marriage.\n\nIf we adopt the Democratic Party's policies as our own, what's the point? We might as well go the way of the Tories.\n\nHere is the operative wording from a draft first obtained by the Washington Post and later made public:\n\nThe new platform draft also removes language from 2016 condemning the U.S. Supreme Court's 2015 decision to grant same-sex couples the right to marry. The new language does not weigh in on same-sex marriage at all. \"Republicans will promote a culture that values the sanctity of marriage, the blessings of childhood, and the foundational role of families, and supports working parents,\" it says instead. \"We will end policies that punish families.\"\n\nWe already knew Trump was seeking to remove the goal of a national abortion ban from the party, and this draft reflects that idea. It only briefly mentions opposition to late-term abortion. But the clause on marriage shows that Trump's leftward shift goes beyond concerns about the pro-abortion movement's electoral strength. It is much more systemic.\n\nRemember, since winning the primary, Trump has endorsed nearly every liberal down-ballot candidate. He has stymied conservatives fighting the agenda of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.). He has endorsed Ukraine funding, opposed the repeal of Obamacare, thrown cold water on the Bud Light boycott, expressed support for a new FBI building, argued for an increase in immigration, and won't even commit as a Florida resident to opposing the abortion referendum on the ballot, which would enshrine a right to murder up until birth.\n\nIn fact, even as Trump says he wants to \"leave abortion to the states,\" he specifically pressured the Arizona legislature to repeal its anti-abortion law. Apparently, letting the states decide is a one-way street.\n\nAll of this is happening as Trump elevates figures like Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R), neocon technocrats whom his ardent supporters have opposed in the past. This occurs against the backdrop of him attacking Project 2025, a Steve Bannon-endorsed initiative to set the policy and personnel agenda for Trump's administration to avoid the \"Javanka\" globalism issues from his first term. The Trump campaign not only rejected this agenda but also made it clear it will ignore the \"conservative LinkedIn\" set up by his loyalists to hire MAGA-only applicants for administrative positions. Meanwhile, billionaires like Bill Ackman are promising to staff Trump's administration.\n\nAll these betrayals in such a short period should give conservatives pause and motivate them to voice displeasure. Trump needs a \"Harriet Miers moment.\" Back in 2005, conservatives made it clear that George W. Bush's nomination of his personal counsel to the U.S. Supreme Court was unacceptable. Thanks to pushback, we have enjoyed the jurisprudence of Samuel Alito for nearly two decades. I'm sure glad we didn't have losers on the right back then telling us to shut up and not express our dissatisfaction with the GOP leader because, \"Do you want the Democrat?\"\n\nWhich brings us back to the party platform. Trump's agenda to remake the platform is further proof that his leftward lurch is not just a temporary strategic choice to win an election but a permanent paradigm shift for governing more aligned with Britain's Rishi Sunak and France's Emmanuel Macron than Nigel Farage or Marine Le Pen.\n\nThe new platform aims to replace the social and fiscal conservatism disliked by some, which was adopted by two successive Trump-led conventions, without any committee meetings or amendment votes. Unlike abortion, an issue on which Republicans seem to be losing ground, they are gaining traction against the rainbow jihad, with growing opposition to gay marriage and even stronger opposition to the transgender agenda.\n\nThere is no need to moderate on these issues, even when considering the old establishment's tendency to abandon conservatism when it temporarily loses in polls. Yet the draft, shaped by carefully selected delegates, shows that Trump essentially supports Bruce Jenner's view: acknowledging transgenderism as real and important while arguing for the protection of female sports and opposing funding for minors' castration.\n\nHere is how the Washington Post explains the new platform in the context of the existing one:\n\nThe new platform stops short of seeking to bar parents from seeking medical treatment for minor children, while condemning any taxpayer funding of such procedures. \"We will keep men out of women's sports, ban taxpayer funding for sex change surgeries, and stop taxpayer-funded schools from promoting gender transition, reverse Biden's radical rewrite of Title IX education regulations, and restore protections for women and girls,\" the new platform says.\n\nJenner and Ric Grenell have long propagated this party line: Accept the premise of the homosexual and transgender agenda, but oppose a few of its more unpopular policies. This explains the absence of mentions of bathrooms, drag shows, or adoption issues. Additionally, the only two fundraisers held by Trump's wife this cycle have been for the Log Cabin Republicans, whose entire purpose is to normalize homosexuality within the GOP. Bruce Jenner is also slated to speak at the convention and be introduced as \"Caitlyn\" to normalize that behavior on the right.\n\nSo vociferous were party leaders in their pursuit to normalize liberalism in the platform that they tried to block social conservative delegates from the platform committee. I've heard from several socially conservative party delegates from Southern states that they were offered any committee of their choice at the RNC -- as long as it wasn't the platform committee.\n\nMeantime, the lukewarm Republican chairman of the Missouri GOP just led his executive committee in an unprecedented maneuver to nullify the delegates chosen by the convention activists in favor of a new establishment slate. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) warned against watering down the platform on life and marriage, but those warnings ring hollow if they are not followed up with a Harriet Miers moment.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) just suggested that the party platform should reflect Trump's most recent views. He is exactly wrong. Trump is what he is at this point. What we need is a bulwark against the uniparty down the ballot in the GOP and the red states because clearly Trump, while superior to Biden, will not be that bulwark. Accusing those of us concerned with Trump's direction of preferring Biden and the Democrats is a straw man. You can still nominate Trump at the convention while working to reverse the platform's damage over the next few days. But if we adopt the Democratic Party's policies as our own, what's the point? We might as well go the way of the Tories.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coattail_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coattail effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affordable Care Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Miers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harriet Miers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Globalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_loyalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulster loyalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neoconservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

In 2016, she met with candidate Trump to explain the importance of the pro-life language and felt confident in his commitment to its retention. Her last official activity before her passing was attending the GOP convention in Cleveland and hosting her final Life of the Party celebration upon re-adoption of a life-affirming Platform. Anne Schlafly, Phyllis Schlafly's daughter and Chairman of Eagle Forum, said, \"My mother would have been disgusted with the heavy-handed procedures that were used to stifle the grassroots and shove an insipid platform down our throats.\"\n\nThe Platform Committee was denied the opportunity to offer amendments or have any discussion on the issues before its rushed adoption. Phyllis loved the spirited debates and the friendships she developed by serving on nine Platform Committees.\n\nThe campaign repeatedly said they wanted to create a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand platform. They failed in this goal. The 'Life' language is not clear but intentionally vague and subject to various interpretations. Ronald Reagan said in 1976, \"Our Platform is a banner of bold unmistakable colors with no pastel shades.\" Sadly, this is not the case this year.\n\nRepublicans remain pro-life -- even if this platform does not reflect those views -- and will continue to advocate for laws protecting the life of the unborn at every level of government.\n\n-----------------------------", "source": {"uri": "timesexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eagle_forum@timesexaminer.com", "name": "Eagle Forum", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Schlafly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phyllis Schlafly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eagle Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716769", "eventUri": "eng-9716769", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 101, "relevance": 1}

PTI\n\nIndia recorded the highest-ever total in women's Tests, finishing their first innings at 603/6 declared before Sune Luus (65) and Marizanne Kapp (69*) led South Africa's fightback on Day 2 of the one-off Test in Chennai on Saturday. At stumps on Saturday, South Africa were 236/4, still trailing India by 367 runs.\n\nThe hosts resumed the day at the overnight score of 525 for four with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and Richa Ghosh beginning the proceedings.\n\nPlaying her fifth Test, the India skipper raised her maiden half-century in the long format, scoring 69 of 115 balls while Richa (86) also got her career-best knock of 86 to extend India's domination. They added 143 runs for the fifth wicket.\n\nAt 576, the Indians broke the record of the highest team total in the Women's Test cricket, bettering the previous record held by Australia, who had posted 575 for nine declared against South Africa in Perth this February. However, at 593, the stand was broken after Harmanpreet was trapped leg-before by Tumi Sekhukhune.\n\nJust 10 runs later, Richa departed too after being trapped leg-before by Nonkululeko Mlaba, and the Indian captain declared the innings. South Africa put up a spirited fight with top-order batter Sune Luus (65) and Marizanne (69 not out) as they finished the day at 236 for four, trailing by 367 runs.\n\nDelmi Tucker remained the most successful South African bowler with figures of two for 141, while Masabata Klaas was the most economical of all (4.35).\n\nThe Proteas began on a convincing note with the bat and remained safe at 29 for no loss at the lunch break. However, the hosts struck after the break, with Sneh Rana trapping the visiting captain leg-before for 20 with a delivery that surprisingly kept low, with the partnership lasting 33 runs.\n\nIn came Luss to join Bosch, and the pair made the most of the batting friendly wicket. The duo added 63 for the second wicket, but Rana broke the stand by removing Bosch for 39. As Kapp joined Luus, South Africa were 106 for two at the tea break.\n\nIn the day's final session, the two batters brought up their respective half-centuries and took the partnership to 93 runs before Luus was trapped leg-before by Deepti Sharma, with the score reading 189 for three. The stand was Proteas' best third-wicket partnership in the format.\n\nNine runs later, Delmi Tucker was caught behind off Rana for a duck. But, the pair of Kapp and Nadine de Klerk played out the remainder of the day with an unbeaten 38-run stand for the fifth wicket. The hosts did not exactly struggle with the ball. While the lack of enough turns did make it challenging out there, the ball occasionally kept low, troubling the visitors.\n\nThe Indians were decent with their fielding efforts, but a couple of close chances did not go their way. For India, Rana was the star with the ball, with her figures reading three for 61, whereas Deepti Sharma was also impressive (1/40).", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Proteas got off to a strong start and went into Lunch at 29/0. After Lunch, the hosts struck through Sneh Rana as the bowl kept low and trapped the visiting captain leg-before for 20.\n\nAnneke Bosch was joined by Sune Luus and the two capitalized on the batting-friendly track. After the pair put up a 63-run partnership for the second wicket, Bosch was removed by Rana for 39. South Africa were 106 for two at the Tea as Marizanne Kapp joined Luus. The two batters reached their respective half-centuries and pushed the partnership to 93 runs in the last session of the day. Deepti Sharma then trapped Luus LBW, leaving the Proteas 189/3.\n\nDelmi Tucker was caught behind by Rana for a duck. However, Kapp and Nadine de Klerk shared an undefeated 38-run partnership at the end of the day's play. Indian players missed a few easy opportunities. Rana was the star of the show for India with the ball, taking three wickets for 61, while Deepti also showed strong performance (1/40).\n\nEarlier, the hosts started the day with skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and Richa Ghosh at the overnight score of 525/4. In her fifth Test match, India captain achieved her first half-century in the lengthy format with 69 runs off 115 balls. Richa also recorded her best-ever innings of 86 to further solidify India's lead. The two added 143 runs for the fifth wicket.\n\nThe Indians, with a score of 576, surpassed Australia, who had set the previous record with 575 for nine declared against South Africa in Perth this February. But at 593, Tumi Sekhukhune trapped Harmanpreet's leg before, shattering their stand.\n\nAfter being caught leg-before by Nonkululeko Mlaba, Richa also went out and the Indian captain declared the innings with a score of 603/6.

The duo added 63 for the second wicket, but Rana broke the stand by removing Bosch for 39.\n\nAs Kapp joined Luus, South Africa was 106 for two at the tea break.\n\nIn the day's final session, the two batters brought up their respective half-centuries and took the partnership to 93 runs before Luus was trapped leg-before by Deepti Sharma, with the score reading 189 for three.\n\nThe stand was Proteas' best third-wicket partnership in the format.\n\nNine runs later, Delmi Tucker was caught behind off Rana for a duck. But, the pair of Kapp and Nadine de Klerk played out the remainder of the day with an unbeaten 38-run stand for the fifth wicket.\n\nThe hosts did not exactly struggle with the ball. While the lack of enough turns did make it challenging out there, the ball occasionally kept low, troubling the visitors.\n\nThe Indians were decent with their fielding efforts, but a couple of close chances did not go their way.\n\nFor India, Rana was the star with the ball, with her figures reading three for 61, whereas Deepti Sharma was also impressive (1/40).", "source": {"uri":

Harmanpreet, playing her fifth Test, achieved her maiden half-century, scoring 69 off 115 balls, while Richa played her career-best innings of 86. Together, they added 143 runs for the fifth wicket.\n\nAt 576, India broke the record for the highest team total in women's Test cricket, surpassing Australia's previous mark of 575 for nine declared against South Africa in Perth earlier this year. However, the partnership was broken at 593 when Harmanpreet was trapped leg-before by Tumi Sekhukhune. Richa departed soon after, also leg-before, to Nonkululeko Mlaba, prompting the Indian captain to declare the innings.\n\nIn response, South Africa showed resilience with Sune Luus (65) and Marizanne Kapp (69 not out) leading the charge. They finished the day at 236 for four, trailing by 367 runs. Delmi Tucker was South Africa's most successful bowler with figures of two for 141, while Masabata Klaas was the most economical.\n\nSouth Africa started positively, reaching 29 for no loss by lunch. However, Sneh Rana struck after the break, trapping the visiting captain leg-before for 20. Luus and Bosch then formed a solid partnership, adding 63 runs before Rana dismissed Bosch for 39. Kapp joined Luus, and the pair took the score to 106 for two at tea.\n\nIn the final session, both batters reached their half-centuries, but Luus was eventually trapped leg-before by Deepti Sharma for 65, breaking the 93-run stand, the best third-wicket partnership for South Africa in the format. Delmi Tucker was dismissed for a duck soon after, caught behind off Rana. However, Kapp and Nadine de Klerk ensured no further damage, ending the day with an unbeaten 38-run partnership for the fifth wicket.\n\nIndia's bowlers had to contend with a lack of turn and some low bounce.

Richa made her career-best knock of 86.\n\nBoth added 143 runs for the fifth wicket, dominating the South African attack.\n\nAt 576, India surpassed Australia's previous highest team total in Women's Test cricket of 575 for nine declared against South Africa in Perth this February.\n\nHarmanpreet's innings ended at 593, trapped leg-before by Tumi Sekhukhune, and just ten runs later, Richa also fell leg-before to Nonkululeko Mlaba, prompting India to declare their innings.\n\nSouth Africa began their innings strongly with Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp leading the way. Luus scored 65, while Kapp remained unbeaten at 69 by the end of the day. South Africa closed at 236 for four, trailing by 367 runs.\n\nDelmi Tucker was the most successful South African bowler with figures of two for 141, and Masabata Klaas was the most economical.\n\nThe Proteas started positively and went to lunch safely at 29 for no loss. After the break, India struck with Sneh Rana trapping the visiting captain leg-before for 20. The partnership ended at 33 runs. Luus joined Bosch and added 63 for the second wicket before Rana removed Bosch for 39.\n\nBy the tea break, South Africa was at 106 for two, with Kapp joining Luus. In the final session, both batters reached their respective half-centuries.\n\nTheir partnership was fruitful at 93 runs for the third wicket until Deepti Sharma trapped Luus leg-before, bringing the score to 189 for three. This stand was the best third-wicket partnership for South Africa in the format.\n\nNine runs later, Delmi Tucker was caught behind off Rana for a duck. Kapp and Nadine de Klerk then navigated the remainder of the day with an unbeaten 38-run stand for the fifth wicket.\n\nThe ball's occasional low bounce presented challenges, but the Indians maintained steady fielding efforts. They missed a couple of close chances but did not struggle significantly with the ball.\n\nSneh Rana was the standout bowler for India, finishing with figures of three for 61, while Deepti Sharma also made a notable impact, taking one wicket for 40 runs. India's strong batting performance and South Africa's resilient response have set up an intriguing contest for the remaining days of the Test.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

They each brought up their respective half-centuries in the final session of the day before Sharma struck to dismiss Luus and break the partnership.\n\nTucker didn't stay for long at the crease as she was caught behind by Ghosh off Rana.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richa_Ghosh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richa Ghosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_de_Klerk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nadine de Klerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\u00e9_Luus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun\u00e9 Luus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marizanne_Kapp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marizanne Kapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonkululeko_Mlaba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonkululeko Mlaba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumi_Sekhukhune", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tumi Sekhukhune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delmi_Tucker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delmi Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke_Bosch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anneke Bosch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Wolvaardt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laura Wolvaardt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masabata_Klaas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masabata Klaas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/201794-ilcfjavtyi-1719665984.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693057", "eventUri": "eng-9693057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

With the pitch offering a sharper turn, will be hoping to bundle out South Africa as early as possible on the third day and put them under further pressure in the four-day match being played at the MA Chidambaram Stadium here.\n\nAfter India had declared their innings for their highest score, just a few overs before the end of the morning session on Day 2, South Africa reached 29 no loss at lunch. The Indians however, struck the first blow soon after the resumption with Sneh Rana trapping skipper Laura Wolvaardt for 20 with one that turned and stayed low. South Africa lost their first wicket for 33.\n\nLuus and Anneke Bosch (39) raised 63 runs for the second wicket, taking the visitors to 96. Rana made another breakthrough for India as Bosch edged to Deepti Sharma in the slips. Luus completed her half-century in 131 balls, hitting four boundaries and one six. She was joined by Kapp as they took South Africa past 150 runs.\n\nOff-spinner Deepti Sharma broke the partnership when she trapped Luus LBW, ending her 164-ball vigil for 65 with a delivery that spun back into the batter, sneaked past the bat and struck her the back pad. Luus used the DRS, which showed that no bat was involved, and the ball would have hit the middle stump. South Africa were 169/3 in the 60th over.\n\nRana grabbed her third wicket of the day when she got Delmi Tucker to edge one behind to Richa Ghosh for an 8-ball duck.\n\nKapp found a willing partner in Nadine de Klerk as they took the score past the 200-run mark. Kapp completed her fifty off 67 balls, hitting seven boundaries and South Africa's hopes depend on her and her partnership with de Klerk as they have raised 38 runs for the unbeaten fifth wicket partnership.\n\nEarlier in the morning, India had batted superbly in their first innings, with Shafali Verma scoring 203 off 197 balls (4\u00d723, 6\u00d78) and Smriti Mandhana contributing 149 off 163 balls reaching 525/4 at the end of the opening day. Harmanpreet Kaur and Richa Ghosh, who were batting on 42 and 43 respectively at stumps on Friday, duly completed their half-centuries as the hosts attempted to bat out their opponents.\n\nHarman was the first to complete her fifty on Day 2, reaching the mark from 89 balls (2\u00d74). India reached 550 soon after in the 105th over and soon Richa reached her half-century off just 54 balls, studded with 11 boundaries. They raised 143 runs for the fifth wicket partnership as India surged past 600 runs.\n\nRicha Ghosh was finally out for 86 off 90 balls, studded with 16 boundaries. It was her attacking innings that helped India post a mammoth total.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nIndia 603/6dec in 115.1 overs (Shafali 205, Mandhana 149, Richa Ghosh 86, Harmanpreet 69, Tucker 2-141) lead South Africa 236/4 in 72 overs (Kapp 69*, Luus 65, Rana 3-61) by 367 runs.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_women's_national_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa women's national cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\u00e9_Luus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sun\u00e9 Luus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_women's_national_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India women's national cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richa_Ghosh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richa Ghosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marizanne_Kapp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marizanne Kapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke_Bosch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anneke Bosch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Wolvaardt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laura Wolvaardt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Chidambaram_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M.

If Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp fought hard on the second day after India declared at 603 for 6, Luus was at it again on Sunday, in the company of Laura Wolvaardt this time, which helped South Africa cut down the deficit to 105 runs after they were bowled out for 266 in the first innings.\n\nAt stumps on the third day, South Africa were 232 for 2 in their second innings, with Luus scoring her first Test hundred and Wolvaardt remaining unbeaten on 93. South Africa will hope for more of the same on the fourth and final day to push the game to a draw.\n\nIt was an eventful opening session for India on a hazy morning where Sneh Rana's sensational bowling on a pitch offering more turn fetched her five wickets - to go with three from Saturday - to give her figures of 8 for 77. South Africa lost six wickets for 30 runs after starting the day on 236 for 4.\n\nRana got the first breakthrough in her third over, the fifth of the day, when she dismissed a well-set Kapp for 74 with an almost unplayable delivery. Kapp was done in by the extra bounce as the ball, after pitching on off and middle, popped up to beat her outside edge and take the top of off stump. This triggered a collapse as three balls later, Rana removed Sinalo Jafta, who inside-edged one to Shubha Satheesh at short leg.\n\nThree overs later, Deepti Sharma picked up her second wicket. This time the ball stayed low when debutant Annerie Dercksen missed with her prod and was hit on her back pad. South Africa took the review but it was in vain. In the following over, Rana took her sixth when Nadine de Klerk perished whipping towards square leg where Rajeshwari Gayakwad dived in front to complete the catch. No. 7 and No. 8 came soon after as Rana finished off the innings.\n\nRana became only the second Indian woman to pick up eight wickets in an innings in Test cricket after Neetu David, now India's chair of selectors, who took 8 for 53 in a two-run loss against England in Jamshedpur in 1995.\n\nIndia enforced the follow-on with South Africa 337 runs behind. They then lost Anneke Bosch early to low bounce when she was trapped in front by Deepti in the first over. But Wolvaardt nailed her cover drives and looked assured in her approach.\n\nAt lunch, South Africa were 29 for 1. India struggled from that point, going wicketless for close to 66 overs across the second and third sessions.\n\nIn this period, Luus and Wolvaardt shared a mammoth 190-run partnership for the second wicket to provide South Africa hope of a draw. It was South Africa's highest partnership for any wicket in women's Tests.\n\nSouth Africa came out in the afternoon session determined to play the long game and they succeeded, scoring 95 runs in 34 overs to take tea at 124 for 1. Luus, who made 65 off 164 balls in the first innings, carried forward that form and temperament, moving to 64 off 121 balls at the end of the second session.\n\nHaving been trapped lbw to one that kept low from Rana in the first innings, Wolvaardt used the depth of the crease more in the second dig. She pulled short deliveries through square leg and drove the fuller ones to long-on.\n\nIndia toiled hard to break the stand with Harmanpreet Kaur trying as many as seven bowlers, including herself. But they weren't disciplined with their lengths and speeds. Perhaps not being used to such a long time in the middle affected them. Deepti also dropped two catches - Kapp benefitting both times - in the last two overs of the day. The first was at slip off a Rana delivery that Kapp edged, and the second was a straightforward return catch.\n\nWolvaardt and Luus, though, reaped the rewards of patience on a pitch that got slower after the first session.\n\nConsuming more than 200 balls meant Luus and Wolvaardt also had gotten used to the low bounce, with only the odd delivery popping up in the last two sessions of the day. Luus spent 234 minutes at the crease, hitting 18 fours. When she reached her half-century, Luus brought out the rocking-baby-cradle celebration, a gesture for the team's strength and conditioning coach Zane Webster, who is an expectant father. She scored her maiden century in the final session, and became only the second South African to score a hundred in India in women's Tests.\n\nThe huge stand was finally broken by Harmanpreet when she cleaned up Luus in the 74th over. The low bounce came to her aid as Luus went back to pull but missed.\n\nWith Kapp at the other end, Wolvaardt marched on to finish unbeaten. That has raised hopes of a South African lead on the last day, a scenario that looked near-impossible at the start of Sunday.\n\nFor India, Jemimah Rodrigues was off the field for a majority of the last two sessions because of cramps.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type":

The veteran batters helped the visitors to 236 for 4 on Saturday on yet another day of batting dominance.\n\nThe hosts had declared their first innings on 603 for 6 in the morning session after the overnight batters Harmanpreet Kaur and Richa Ghosh had departed following their respective half-centuries. The fifth wicket stand extended to 143 runs before the Indian skipper was trapped legbefore by Tumi Sekhukune. Ghosh continued with her aggressive batting but fell 14 runs short of a century.\n\nUnlike India, South Africa made a watchful start to their innings before skipper Laura Wolvaardt was trapped legbefore by Sneh Rana. Anne Bosch and Sune Luus kept the Indian bowlers at bay for more than an hour and stitched a 63-run stand for the second wicket before the former was undone by Rana delivery that turned and bounced sharply to take an edge to slips.\n\nLulus, however, continued to put up a defiant show with the bat on a surface where there wasn't much assistance for the bowlers. To give her company, Kapp came to the fore and helped the side to Tea without any further damage. However, in the last hour of the day, the offspin duo of Rana and Deepti Sharma struck twice in quick succession to pull the momentum back in India's favour. While Luus was pinged in front of the middle stump by Deepti, Ghosh took a fine low catch to send Delmi Tucker back for a duck.\n\nNadine de Klerk, who had survived a run out and was dropped early in her innings, took the attack to Deepti and Rajeshwari Gayakwad, stroking five boundaries to propel South Africa's scoring rate late in the day. She went to stumps unbeaten in the company of Kapp.\n\nBrief scores: India 603/6 decl.

The day began with India resuming their innings on 525/4 with captain Harmanpreet Kaur (42*) and Richa Ghosh (43*) at the crease.

Luss and Kapp added a massive 93 runs for the third wicket and took their team's score past 180. However, they couldn't extend their partnership with Deepti Sharma striking for the hosts by trapping Luus in front of the stumps for 65.\n\nDelmi Tucker walked in at number five but failed to trouble the scorers as she ended up giving a sharp catch to Richa Ghosh behind the stumps facing Sneh Rana and left South Africa reeling at 198/4. Following her dismissal, Nadine de Klerk and Kapp saw their team to stumps with their unbeaten 38-run stand.\n\nSneh Rana was the pick of the bowlers for India with figures of 3/61 in 21 overs while Deepti Sharma picked up 1/40.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke_Bosch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anneke Bosch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumi_Sekhukhune", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tumi Sekhukhune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_de_Klerk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nadine de Klerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marizanne_Kapp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marizanne Kapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richa_Ghosh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richa Ghosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\u00e9_Luus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sun\u00e9 Luus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Wolvaardt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laura Wolvaardt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delmi_Tucker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delmi Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/sune-luus-celebrates-her-half-century-29422622-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=Z7Mklsdpn3TkAS4c3tgIVno6wYMgzWVr", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693057", "eventUri": "eng-9693057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The visitors went to stumps on 232 for 2, still trailing India by 105 runs at the end of third day's play.\n\nResuming Day 3 on 236 for 4, South Africa lost overnight half-centurion Marizanne Kapp early.

Luus, playing only her third Test, registered her maiden Test century, after already having scored a 65 in the first innings.\n\nIt was the highest partnership for any wicket for South Africa, overhauling the effort of Johmari Logtenberg and Charlize van der Westhuizen (138 runs vs England in 2003).\n\nHowever, late in the day, she fell while attempting to pull Harmanpreet Kaur. She got an inside edge on to the stumps, handing India their second wicket of the innings after nearly four hours of vigil.

The first was Mignon du Preez when she scored 102 in Mysore back in 2014.\n\nThe second-wicket partnership was broken eventually by India captain Harmanpreet Kaur who snuck the ball through the defences of Luus to demolish her stumps.\n\nAfter the new ball was taken, Rana had a golden chance to rattle South Africa right before end of play when she got Kapp to edge one to first slip, but Sharma fumbled the chance.\n\nIn the next over, Sharma herself had a chance for redemption on a caught and bowled chance of Kapp, but failed to complete it once more.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\u00e9_Luus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sun\u00e9 Luus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Wolvaardt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laura Wolvaardt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow-on", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Follow-on"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_de_Klerk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nadine de Klerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marizanne_Kapp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marizanne Kapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashleigh_Gardner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashleigh Gardner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke_Bosch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anneke Bosch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mignon_du_Preez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mignon du Preez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/201816-qsabetwxlc-1719752263.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693057", "eventUri": "eng-9693057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

At stumps, the visitors were still 367 runs behind.\n\nSune Luus and Marizanne Kapp began the repair work for the Proteas with a 93-run stand for the third wicket after the Proteas were 96 for 2 at one stage. Both Sune and Marizanne displayed commendable resilience and technique during their half century knocks.\n\nCaptain Laura Wolvaardt and Anneke Bosch looked composed in the six overs before lunch, before Sneh Rana got the first breakthrough in the eighth over when she bowled one rare short ball. But it kept low and Wolvaardt completely missed her pull to be trapped lbw after scoring a 36-ball 20.\n\nBosch continued to build the innings in the company of Sune with a 63-run second wicket partnership. However, once the pair got their eyes in during their 23 overs in the middle, Rana struck once again to end Bosch's resistance that came in the form of a 73-ball 39, with the help of four fours and a six, falling a few overs before tea.\n\nAt 96 for 2, South Africa found stability with Kapp and Luus mixing caution with aggression. Luus respected the good deliveries, scoring almost equally on the off and leg side. In all, she scored 65 off 164 balls that included six fours and one six over long-on against Rana before Deepti broke the stand when she beat Luus' inside edge and trapped her lbw.\n\nLuus reviewed the on-field decision but it was in vain. Delmi Tucker became Rana's third victim when Richa Ghosh took a sharp catch to dismiss her for an eight-ball duck.\n\nKapp, however, scored predominantly on the off side, with seven of her eight fours coming in that area as she reached her 50 off 87 balls and remained unbeaten on 69 off 125 at stumps, despite battling cramps and a stiff back. Nadine de Klerk, who joined Kapp at the fall of Tucker, stitched an unbroken 38-run stand off 56 balls. De Klerk showed good intent in the final hour and hit five fours in her unbeaten 27 off 28 balls.\n\nEarlier, Richa Ghosh and captain Harmanpreet Kaur started cautiously but soon converted their starts into half-centuries. The pair stretched their stand to 143 runs. Harmanpreet made 69 off 115 balls before being dismissed in the 15th over of the day when fast bowler Tumi Sekhukhune trapped her in front to leave India at 593 for 5.

The visitors, however, showed remarkable grit in their first innings, thanks to Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp. On the second day, their partnership held firm, helping South Africa reach 236 for 4 at stumps. Yet, on Sunday morning, Sneh Rana's sensational spin bowling turned the game on its head.\n\nRana, exploiting the turn and bounce from the pitch, decimated the South African lineup, adding five more wickets to her tally from the previous day. She finished with figures of 8 for 85, orchestrating a collapse that saw South Africa lose six wickets for just 30 runs to bowled out for 266.\n\nRana's first breakthrough of the day came when she dismissed a well-set Kapp for 74 with a delivery that pitched on off and middle, taking the top of off stump. This triggered a rapid downfall, with South Africa losing wickets in quick succession.\n\nIndia enforced the follow-on with a significant lead of 337 runs, putting South Africa under immense pressure. They faced an early setback when Deepti Sharma trapped Anneke Bosch lbw in the first over. However, South Africa's fighting spirit shone through as Laura Wolvaardt and Sune Luus stitched together a monumental partnership.\n\nAt lunch, they were 29 for 1, and what followed was a masterclass in resilience and skill.\n\nThe duo batted through 66 overs across the second and third sessions, building a 190-run stand -- the highest partnership for any wicket in South African women's Test history. Wolvaardt, using the depth of the crease effectively, and Luus, who carried her first-innings form, blunted the Indian attack with solid defense and precise shot selection.\n\nAt tea, South Africa were 124 for 1, with Luus on 64 off 121 balls, playing positively and punishing loose deliveries.\n\nIndia's bowlers toiled hard to break the stand, with captain Harmanpreet Kaur employing as many as seven bowlers. Despite their efforts, they struggled with consistency in lengths and speeds. Fatigue also seemed to set in, as evidenced by Deepti Sharma dropping two catches off Kapp late in the day.\n\nAs the day wore on, the pitch slowed, and the South African pair grew more accustomed to the low bounce. Luus, after 234 minutes on the field, reached her maiden Test hundred, becoming only the second South African woman to score a century in India. Her celebration -- a rocking baby cradle gesture -- was a tribute to the team's strength and conditioning coach Zane Webster, who is expecting a child.\n\nHarmanpreet Kaur eventually broke the stand, dismissing Luus for 101 with a delivery that stayed low. Wolvaardt, unbeaten on 93, continued to march on with Kapp at the other end, giving South Africa hope of taking a lead on the final day -- a scenario that seemed improbable at the start of Sunday.\n\nFor India, the absence of Jemimah Rodrigues, who was off the field for much of the last two sessions due to cramps, was a notable setback.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nIndia 603/6 decl in 115.1 overs (Shafali Verma 205, Smriti Mandhana 149; Delhi Tucker 2-141, Tumi Sekhukhune 1-70) lead South Africa 266/10 & following-on 232/2 in 88 overs (Sune Luus 109 not out, Laura Wolvaardt 93; Harmanpreet Kaur 1-24, Deepti Sharma 1-56) by 105 runs.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\u00e9_Luus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun\u00e9 Luus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Chidambaram_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

However, SA found some fight in their second essay through Luus (109, 203b, 18\u00d74) and skipper Laura Wolvaardt (93 batting, 252b, 12\u00d74).\n\nResuming at the overnight score of 236 for four, Marizanne Kapp (74) and Nadine de Klerk (39) could not sustain the momentum as the former soon fell to Rana. Kapp's wicket opened the floodgates as the Proteas were bowled out in the subsequent 17 runs. Rana and Deepti Sharma got the job done with ease.\n\nRana's figures were the second-best in a Women's Test innings for India after record-holder Neetu David's eight for 53 against England in Jamshedpur in 1995. Overall, Rana holds the third-best Test innings figures, with Australia's Ashleigh Gardner (eight for 66) preceding her.\n\nTrailing by 337 runs, the Indians enforced follow-on as the South Africans suffered an early setback. Anneke Bosch was trapped leg-before for nine by Deepti with just 16 runs on the board. The end seemed near for the South Africans then.\n\nHowever, Wolvaardt and Luus joined forces to push the hosts on the backfoot. The visitors were 29 for one at the lunch break and they batted till the tea break without further damage to take SA to 124 for one. In the post-tea session, when their partnership surpassed 138, it also became the highest stand for the tourists against India in Test cricket.\n\nMeanwhile, Luus brought up her maiden Test century, as she became only the second South African to hit a Test ton against India after Mignon du Preez (102) in Mysore in 2014. Eventually, Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur broke the 190-run alliance, getting rid of Luus when the score was 206 for two.\n\nThe dismissal brought Kapp together with the skipper and they batted out the remainder of the day.

The visitors, however, showed remarkable grit in their first innings, thanks to Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp. On the second day, their partnership held firm, helping South Africa reach 236 for 4 at stumps. Yet, on Sunday morning, Sneh Rana's sensational spin bowling turned the game on its head.\n\nRana, exploiting the turn and bounce from the pitch, decimated the South African lineup, adding five more wickets to her tally from the previous day. She finished with figures of 8 for 85, orchestrating a collapse that saw South Africa lose six wickets for just 30 runs to bowled out for 266.\n\nRana's first breakthrough of the day came when she dismissed a well-set Kapp for 74 with a delivery that pitched on off and middle, taking the top of off stump. This triggered a rapid downfall, with South Africa losing wickets in quick succession.\n\nIndia enforced the follow-on with a significant lead of 337 runs, putting South Africa under immense pressure. They faced an early setback when Deepti Sharma trapped Anneke Bosch lbw in the first over. However, South Africa's fighting spirit shone through as Laura Wolvaardt and Sune Luus stitched together a monumental partnership.\n\nAt lunch, they were 29 for 1, and what followed was a masterclass in resilience and skill.\n\nThe duo batted through 66 overs across the second and third sessions, building a 190-run stand -- the highest partnership for any wicket in South African women's Test history. Wolvaardt, using the depth of the crease effectively, and Luus, who carried her first-innings form, blunted the Indian attack with solid defense and precise shot selection.\n\nAt tea, South Africa were 124 for 1, with Luus on 64 off 121 balls, playing positively and punishing loose deliveries.\n\nIndia's bowlers toiled hard to break the stand, with captain Harmanpreet Kaur employing as many as seven bowlers. Despite their efforts, they struggled with consistency in lengths and speeds. Fatigue also seemed to set in, as evidenced by Deepti Sharma dropping two catches off Kapp late in the day.\n\nAs the day wore on, the pitch slowed, and the South African pair grew more accustomed to the low bounce. Luus, after 234 minutes on the field, reached her maiden Test hundred, becoming only the second South African woman to score a century in India. Her celebration -- a rocking baby cradle gesture -- was a tribute to the team's strength and conditioning coach Zane Webster, who is expecting a child.\n\nHarmanpreet Kaur eventually broke the stand, dismissing Luus for 101 with a delivery that stayed low. Wolvaardt, unbeaten on 93, continued to march on with Kapp at the other end, giving South Africa hope of taking a lead on the final day -- a scenario that seemed improbable at the start of Sunday.\n\nFor India, the absence of Jemimah Rodrigues, who was off the field for much of the last two sessions due to cramps, was a notable setback.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nIndia 603/6 decl in 115.1 overs (Shafali Verma 205, Smriti Mandhana 149; Delhi Tucker 2-141, Tumi Sekhukhune 1-70) lead South Africa 266/10 & following-on 232/2 in 88 overs (Sune Luus 109 not out, Laura Wolvaardt 93; Harmanpreet Kaur 1-24, Deepti Sharma 1-56) by 105 runs.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hans_india@thehansindia.com", "name": "Hans India", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\u00e9_Luus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun\u00e9 Luus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Chidambaram_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

If Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp fought hard on the second day after India declared at 603 for 6, Luus was at it again on Sunday, in the company of Laura Wolvaardt this time, which helped South Africa cut down the deficit to 105 runs after they were bowled out for 266 in the first innings.\n\nAt stumps on the third day, South Africa were 232 for 2 in their second innings, with Luus scoring her first Test hundred and Wolvaardt remaining unbeaten on 93. South Africa will hope for more of the same on the fourth and final day to push the game to a draw.\n\nIt was an eventful opening session for India on a hazy morning where Sneh Rana's sensational bowling on a pitch offering more turn fetched her five wickets - to go with three from Saturday - to give her figures of 8 for 77. South Africa lost six wickets for 30 runs after starting the day on 236 for 4.\n\nRana got the first breakthrough, in her third over, fifth of the day, to dismiss a well-set Kapp for 74 with an almost unplayable delivery. Kapp fell for the extra bounce as the ball, after pitching on off and middle, popped up to beat her outside edge and take the top of off stump. This triggered the collapse as three balls later she removed wicketkeeper Sinalo Jafta, who inside-edged one to Shubha Satheesh at short leg.\n\nThree overs later, Deepti Sharma picked up her second wicket. This time the ball stayed low when debutant Annerie Dercksen missed her defence to get hit on her back pad and was trapped lbw. South Africa took the review but it was in vain. In the following over, Rana took her sixth wicket when Nadine de Klerk perished while trying to whip one towards square leg where Rajeshwari Gayakwad dived in front to complete the catch.\n\nWith her 8 for 77, Rana became only the second Indian to pick up eight wickets in an innings in Tests, after Neetu David, India's chair of selectors.\n\nWhen India enforced the follow-on, South Africa were still trailing by 337 runs. They then lost Anneke Bosch early to low bounce when she was trapped lbw by Deepti in first over. Wolvaardt nailed her cover drive a few times and looked assured in her approach. At lunch, South Africa were 29 for 1. The hosts struggled from thereon to go wicketless for close to 66 overs across the second and third session.\n\nIn this period, Luus and Wolvaardt shared a mammoth 190-run partnership for the second wicket to blunt the Indian attack and provide South Africa a hope of a draw, going into the final day. It was South Africa's highest partnership for any wicket in women's Tests.\n\nSouth Africa came out in the afternoon session, determined to play the long game and they succeeded, scoring 95 runs in 34 overs to take tea at 124 for 1. Luus, who made 65 off 164 balls in the first innings, carried forward that form and temperament, moving to 64 off 121 balls at the end of second session. She was positive and solid while defending and punished the loose deliveries.\n\nHaving been trapped lbw due to a low bounce in the first innings, Wolvaardt used the depth of the crease more in the second dig. She pulled short deliveries through square leg and drove the fuller ones to long-on. The duo was unhurried and compact through their partnership.\n\nIndia toiled hard to break the stand with Harmanpreet Kaur trying as many as seven bowlers, including herself. They couldn't stay disciplined with their lengths and speeds in the second innings. Perhaps longer time in the middle could have led to tired legs. That reared its head when Deepti dropped two catches - both of Kapp - in the last two overs of the day.\n\nWolvaardt and Luus, though, reaped rewards of patience on a pitch that got slower after the first session.\n\nConsuming more than 200 balls meant Luus and Wolvaardt also had gotten used to the low bounce, with only the odd delivery popping up in the last two sessions of the day. Luus spent 234 minutes on the field, hitting 18 fours. When she reached her half-century, Luus brought out the rocking baby cradle celebration, a gesture for the team's strength and conditioning coach Zane Webster who is an expectant father. She scored her maiden century in the final session, and became only the second South African to score a hundred in India in women's Tests.\n\nThe huge stand was finally broken by Harmanpreet when she cleaned up Luus in the 74th over. The low bounce came to her aid as Luus went back to pull but missed the ball. With Kapp on the other end, Wolvaardt marched on to finish unbeaten. That has raised hopes of a South African lead on the last day, a scenario that looked near-impossible at the start of Sunday.\n\nFor India, Jemimah Rodrigues was off the field for a majority of the last two sessions because of cramps.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki",

The pair managed to add a further 68 runs to the score to see both batters reach their respective fifties before Tumi Sekhukhune (1/70) broke the 143-run partnership by dismissing Kaur.\n\nThe innings eventually came to an end, with India declaring on 603/6, following Ghosh's wicket off the bowling of Nonkululeko Mlaba (1/122).\n\nIn reply to the hosts' first innings score, openers Anneke Bosch (39) and Laura Wolvaardt (20) led South Africa to the lunch break unscathed on 29/0 before the latter became the first scalp to fall shortly after the interval.\n\nDespite losing her captain, Bosch combined well with Luus for a crucial 63-run stand for the second wicket to take the Proteas near the 100-run mark prior to the departure of Bosch, who edged a Sneh Rana (3/61) for her second scalp of the afternoon.\n\nWith South Africa still behind by 507 runs, Luus was joined at the crease by the experienced Kapp as the duo collaborated for a 93-run partnership, with Luus reaching her maiden Test fifty before Kapp emulated the feat with her very own half-century in the final session of the day.\n\nWith the two batters looking settled out in the middle, India's Deepti Sharma (1/40) made the all-important breakthrough to remove Luus LBW before Rana quickly picked up her third wicket to send all-rounder Delmi Tucker (0) back to the hut to leave the Proteas Women 198/4.\n\nAn unbeaten 38-run stand between Kapp and Nadine de Klerk (27*) then helped South Africa end the day's play on 236/4, still trailing by 376 runs.\n\nDay 3 will commence on Sunday, 30 June from 09h30 (06h00 SAST),

South Africa will hope for more of the same on the fourth and final day to push the game to a draw.\n\nIt was an eventful opening session for India on a hazy morning where Sneh Rana's sensational bowling on a pitch offering more turn fetched her five wickets - to go with three from Saturday - to give her figures of 8 for 77. South Africa lost six wickets for 30 runs after starting the day on 236 for 4.\n\nRana got the first breakthrough in her third over, the fifth of the day, when she dismissed a well-set Kapp for 74 with an almost unplayable delivery. Kapp was done in by the extra bounce as the ball, after pitching on off and middle, popped up to beat her outside edge and take the top of off stump. This triggered a collapse as three balls later, Rana removed Sinalo Jafta, who inside-edged one to Shubha Satheesh at short leg.\n\nThree overs later, Deepti Sharma picked up her second wicket. This time the ball stayed low when debutant Annerie Dercksen missed with her prod and was hit on her back pad. South Africa took the review but it was in vain. In the following over, Rana took her sixth when Nadine de Klerk perished whipping towards square leg where Rajeshwari Gayakwad dived in front to complete the catch. No. 7 and No. 8 came soon after as Rana finished off the innings.\n\nRana became only the second Indian woman to pick up eight wickets in an innings in Test cricket after Neetu David, now India's chair of selectors, who took 8 for 53 in a two run loss against England in Jamshedpur in 1995.\n\nIndia enforced the follow-on with South Africa 337 runs behind. They then lost Anneke Bosch early to low bounce when she was trapped in front by Deepti in the first over. But Wolvaardt nailed her cover drives and looked assured in her approach.\n\nAt lunch, South Africa were 29 for 1. India struggled from that point, going wicketless for close to 66 overs across the second and third sessions.\n\nIn this period, Luus and Wolvaardt shared a mammoth 190-run partnership for the second wicket to provide South Africa hope of a draw. It was South Africa's highest partnership for any wicket in women's Tests.\n\nSouth Africa came out in the afternoon session determined to play the long game and they succeeded, scoring 95 runs in 34 overs to take tea at 124 for 1. Luus, who made 65 off 164 balls in the first innings, carried forward that form and temperament, moving to 64 off 121 balls at the end of the second session.\n\nHaving been trapped lbw to one that kept low from Rana in the first innings, Wolvaardt used the depth of the crease more in the second dig. She pulled short deliveries through square leg and drove the fuller ones to long-on.\n\nIndia toiled hard to break the stand with Harmanpreet Kaur trying as many as seven bowlers, including herself. But they weren't disciplined with their lengths and speeds. Perhaps not being used to such a long time in the middle affected them. Deepti also dropped two catches - Kapp benefiting both times - in the last two overs of the day.\n\nWolvaardt and Luus, though, reaped the rewards of patience on a pitch that got slower after the first session.\n\nConsuming more than 200 balls meant Luus and Wolvaardt also had gotten used to the low bounce, with only the odd delivery popping up in the last two sessions of the day. Luus spent 234 minutes at the crease, hitting 18 fours. When she reached her half-century, Luus brought out the rocking-baby-cradle celebration, a gesture for the team's strength and conditioning coach Zane Webster, who is an expectant father.

South Africa still trail India by 105 runs, having been bowled out for 266 in their first innings in response to India's 603 for six. Off-spinner Rana's deadly spell of eight for 77 expedited their collapse.\n\nDespite the tough situation, South Africa showed resilience in their second innings, with Luus scoring 109 off 203 balls, including 18 fours, and skipper Laura Wolvaardt remaining unbeaten on 93 off 252 balls, with 12 fours. Resuming at the overnight score of 236 for four, Marizanne Kapp (74) and Nadine de Klerk (39) failed to maintain momentum, as Kapp soon fell to Rana.

They stitched a near-century stand to stay alive in the contest.\n\nThe visitors remained unfazed about India's gigantic total and went about their business calmly on Saturday.Proteas openers Laura Wolvaardt (20) and Anneke Bosch (39) were undeterred by the scorching heat in their seven overs at the MA Chidambaram Stadium as they began their innings in smooth fashion. Both got off the mark with a four and went on to hit the pacers for boundaries occasionally.\n\nTo separate the duo, India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who had closely observed the passage of play in the morning session, was tempted to bring in the ever-reliable Sneh Rana (3-61) on the spin-friendly surface. Right after the lunch break, Sneh hit the nail on the head by giving India their first breakthrough.\n\nThe right-arm off-break bowler looked determined to get rid of South Africa captain Wolvaardt. In the eighth over, she first lost a review when a sharply turning delivery appeared to be on the path of Wolvaardt's stumps. Three deliveries later, she finally got her prized wicket as the ball kept low and did not turn as much as it did in the previous deliveries, trapping Wolvaardt LBW.\n\nSpeaking to the media after the match, Sneh, who was the pick of the bowlers, said: \"Laura's wicket was the most satisfactory one because I have been manifesting her wicket for a long time.\"\n\nAfter losing Wolvaardt, Bosch and Luus kept India at bay in a well-curated stand of 63 runs off 137 balls. It was Sneh who once again did the job for the hosts, dismissing Bosch as her fellow offie Deepti Sharma took a catch at first slip.\n\nThe day's highlight was the alliance between Luus and Kapp, who made most of the dropped catches and missed chances. They took time to settle in and shared a crucial 93-run partnership for the third wicket. The pair showed defiance against the Indian bowlers with their good techniques and kept SA in the contest.\n\nBefore the curtains were brought down on day's play, Kapp and Nadine de Klerk (27*) survived the last phase to remain unbeaten. South Africa amassed 130 runs in the final session of the day and will be satisfied with their fightback.\n\nEarlier, after being completely outplayed and conceding 525 runs on the opening day, the South African bowlers encountered another dazzling display of batting from the Indians -- Harmanpreet (69, 115b; 4x4) and Richa Ghosh (86, 90b; 16x4) -- motored to their fifties as the duo added 143 runs off 154 balls for the fifth wicket.

Crisp technique, stroke play that's pleasing to the eye, resilience and patience - some of the hardest physical and emotional attributes of a player are tested to an extreme in a format where time can seem endless and suffocatingly short for two sides at the same time.\n\nThat's why underdog stories, redemption arcs and tales of defiance are so popular in the game's purest form. Ask South Africa.\n\nThe Proteas finished day two of the one-off Test against India, having lost four wickets for 236 on the board and still trailing by a Herculean 367-run margin in the first innings.\n\nIf you're a South African player or even a fan, it's easy to feel a bit overburdened by uncontrollables. Imagine having a weak spin attack for a Test to be played on what was shaping up to be a dust bowl. Imagine coming into the game with your best pacer (Marizanne Kapp), not bowling due to injury management, your second-best pacer (Ayabonga Khaka) miles away from red-ball cricket after a potentially career-threatening injury, and a serious dearth of spin resources. Add a complete lack of a red-ball base in your nation to this. The baggage is fairly heavy and was tied up neatly with a bow when India hounded an unsteady bowling contingent en route to a mammoth score of 603.\n\nBut then, Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp happened. Two warhorses who have time and again pulled unreal shifts for their nation did it once more as they defied India through the day.\n\nAfter Laura Wolvaardt fell cheaply, the onus of rebuilding the innings fell on the two senior pros. Luus first stitched a 63-run stand with Anneke Bosch for the second wicket and then put up a 93-run third-wicket stand with Kapp to help South Africa gain ground in Chennai.\n\n\"Obviously, we needed to bat through the whole day and get some partnerships going. I think the big thing was just to be patient. (The balls) outside off, be patient with that, not to go fishing too early on. (The idea was to) just keep the straight one out and make sure that your defence is very good and every shot you play is just very solid and how you planned it,\" a tanned and tired Luus told reporters after the day's play.\n\nThere was plenty of uncertainty about the Chepauk pitch. Ahead of the Test, South Africa anticipated jitters handling India's spin attack and focussed on different variations in the nets. Wolvaardt looked shaky, Tazmin Brits struggled to time her sweeps and there were plenty of instances of players getting beaten.\n\nOf the 164 balls Luus faced, 129 were from India's spin quartet of Deepti Sharma, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Sneh Rana and Harmanpreet Kaur and made a conscious effort to not get frazzled by anything even mildly dangerous from the tweakers.\n\n\"It's either going to roll or there's going to be even bounce. I don't think you can play for the one that doesn't bounce. It's obviously very unpredictable. I think we just stuck to our game plans and we obviously had certain plans against the various bowlers and we felt using the depth of our crease was probably the way to go today... just keeping a straight bat. I think that's the only thing we probably could have done better is just keep the bat straight instead of looking square early on in the innings,\" Luus said in hindsight.\n\nDay 2 Report - Luus, Kapp help South Africa gain ground in against India on Day 2\n\nThe heat did not make things easy for the side. At every drinks break, Protean subs would bring out a large umbrella for the batters in the middle to briefly escape under, temporarily shielded from the harsh sunlight. Ice packs and countless bottles of water were exhausted. Kapp even looked to have some discomfort in her lower back paired with cramps towards the end of the day courtesy of the sapping conditions here.\n\n\"I think Perth felt like winter compared to Chennai, now that I look back. Today was really one of the hottest days I've ever experienced in my career. It really was a good challenge as a cricketer today. I think mentally you just had to stick in there and forget about the heat however you could. We had four days in between the ODIs and the Test. It feels long but we only had two days to prepare for this. I think our game plan was just to bat longer, be patient and have a good defence.\"\n\nWolvaardt's dismissal is an example of a momentary loss of composure which resulted in a wicket. Sneh Rana set up Wolvaardt perfectly. She kept angling the ball in, attacking her on the pads. After one vociferous appeal was negated, Sneh got her wicket, with Wolvaardt trapped plumb. Deepti too was remarkably stingy. In 15 overs, she gave away just 40 runs taking one wicket at an economy of 2.66.\n\n\"The two offspinners bowled exceptionally today. They were hitting those revs and we didn't know where to go - back or forward - or when the balls were popping or staying low. Our priority was to build partnerships - whether we were on zero off 20 or zero off 30 balls. As long as we stayed there, I thought we'd have the best chance.\n\n\"No bowler is good enough to bowl on the same spot every single ball for how many ever overs are required. We knew at some point she (Sneh) would give us something, either just to get off strike or to get that boundary. But we just needed to be patient.\"\n\nSouth Afric's Sune Luus plays a shot against India during the lone test match. | Photo Credit: JOTHI RAMALINGAM B/The Hindu\n\nSouth Afric's Sune Luus plays a shot against India during the lone test match. | Photo Credit: JOTHI RAMALINGAM B/The Hindu\n\nLuus credits a spin camp for the batters held weeks ago for some of the confidence the Proteas showed with the bat on Saturday.\n\n\"We've got a new batting coach - Baakier Abrahams - with some new ideas and a fresh perspective on things. He really helped us just to tweak one or two things. Not big changes to our game; I think it's very hard to change just before a series, but just to add some elements to the game that could help us in this situation. Using the depth of the crease, coming forward...All those things came into play today and helped us get to those 40-50 runs and expanded our games a little.\"\n\nThrough their defiant innings, Kapp - who came into the series nursing a back issue - was seen holding her hip and leaning on her bat for support while standing at the non-striker's. Standing in the field for an entire day plus an hour and a half on day two did not make life easy for the Proteas.\n\n\"There were a few conversations about whether they were going to go for 1000 runs or declare before lunch. But we were prepared to stand in the field for however long. I think this is what you train for. This is why we go to the gym..why we run. So we were prepared to stick it out and try and fight for those wickets.\n\n\"I think they were kind of batting to get those centuries so it was sweet to get them out. Obviously, you'd love to see people you played with to get those milestones, but I'm glad we took those wickets and we could go off before lunch.\"\n\nKapp and Luus' partnership was a confluence of different energies. While Luus dropped anchor, Kapp scored at a brisk ODI pace, keeping the Indian field on its toes. She was eventually forced to take her foot off the pedal when wickets began falling at the other end. Much of her zen was maintained with some help from Luus at the non-striker's end.\n\nSouth Afric's Marizanne Kapp plays a shot against India. | Photo Credit: JOTHI RAMALINGAM B/The Hindu\n\nSouth Afric's Marizanne Kapp plays a shot against India. | Photo Credit: JOTHI RAMALINGAM B/The Hindu\n\n\"There were a lot of conversations about keeping her calm today because she felt she was hitting the ball so nicely. In that space, you feel like you can just hit every ball and it'll go where you want it to go. But she knew that she needed to be patient, and she still had a long way to go. My job today was really just to have those conversations with her. She needed to be level-headed today and she asked me to help her out with that,\" Luus revealed.\n\nKapp is no stranger to lone-wolf efforts with the bat. In the one-off Test against England in 2022, she scored a brilliant 150 which eventually proved crucial in securing a draw in the side's first Test in eight years. Luus, for one, would love to see an encore.\n\n\"It's very impressive to bat with someone([like her). Her game is just sorted. She knows what she wants to do. She looks invincible at the moment, and I'm hoping she gets another 150 and maybe converts to 200 tomorrow.\"\n\nAnother thread that ties these players together is how crucial they've become with bat and ball for their countries. Luus is a handy leg-spinner alongside being a top-five batter. However, the 28-year-old has swapped to off-spin recently for reasons neither she nor the team management has explained.\n\nWith South Africa's spin contingent struggling to contain the Indians, it was puzzling to see Luus bowl all of three overs in the innings. Delmi Tucker told the media that Wolvaardt intended Luus to come in to give the mainstream spinners a breather and nothing else.\n\nWhile Luus looks disillusioned with being a leggie, the desperation Wolvaardt might feel for her to get settled into life as an off-spinner is not lost on her.\n\n\"It's obviously still very early days with the off-spin. I only started this a month ago. So it's very new. I wasn't expecting to bowl in India at all. So it was a bit of a challenge. That said, it's nice to get the ball in hand again. I've missed it. So hopefully I can just continue to work on it and make it a permanent thing and be that extra spinner that Laura needs whenever. I think I always look at myself as someone who can make an impact, whether it's with the bat, the ball, in the field. I know the team needs that extra allrounder and I am trying to get there.\"\n\nThe phrase 'on paper' can carry heavy prejudice. Not many people gave South Africa a chance against a team as dominant in Tests as India, particularly on its home turf. Given the magnitude of that first innings score, it might even be safe to call it improbable. That said, India's bowling muscle was expected to trigger a collapse, expected to draw out a submission akin to what it managed against England and Australia last December.\n\nThat Luus and Kapp could resist in this manner, with barely any red ball infrastructure to work within, might be the positive that keeps the Protean spark alive, in this game and in this format.\n\nLatest on SportstarIND-W vs SA-W, One-off Test: Luus, Kapp defy conditions, Indian spin threat to keep South Africa afloatLavanya Lakshmi NarayananCAN 0-0 CHI highlights, Copa America 2024: Canada reaches quarterfinals in maiden campaign, Chile eliminatedTeam SportstarArgentina vs Peru highlights, ARG 2-0 PER, Copa America 2024: Lautaro brace guides Albiceleste to win, Messi and Co top group A, Peru eliminated Team SportstarCopa America 2024: Qualification scenarios after matchday 2; How can teams reach quarterfinals?Team SportstarArgentina vs Peru LIVE match in pictures, ARG 1-0 PER, Copa America 2024: Lionel Messi photos, real-time galleryAneesh Dey _11547READ MORE STORIES", "source": {"uri": "sportstar.thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportstar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_women's_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_2021\u201322", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India women's cricket team in Australia in 2021\u201322"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marizanne_Kapp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marizanne Kapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First-class cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\u00e9_Luus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sun\u00e9 Luus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke_Bosch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anneke Bosch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tazmin_Brits", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tazmin Brits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayabonga_Khaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayabonga Khaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Wolvaardt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laura Wolvaardt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Chidambaram_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

South Africa still trail India by 105 runs, after they were bundled out for 266 in the first innings chasing India's 603 for six. Off-spinner Sneh Rana's deadly effort of eight for 77 hastened their collapse.\n\nHowever, SA found some fight in their second essay through Luus (109, 203b, 18x4) and skipper Laura Wolvaardt (93 batting, 252b, 12x4).\n\nResuming at the overnight score of 236 for four, Marizanne Kapp (74) and Nadine de Klerk (39) could not sustain the momentum as the former soon fell to Rana.\n\nKapp's wicket opened the floodgates as the Proteas were bowled out in the subsequent 17 runs. Rana and Deepti Sharma got the job done with ease.\n\nRana's figures were the second-best in a Women's Test innings for India after record-holder Neetu David's eight for 53 against England in Jamshedpur in 1995.\n\nOverall, Rana holds the third-best Test innings figures, with Australia's Ashleigh Gardner (eight for 66) preceding her.\n\nTrailing by 337 runs, the Indians enforced follow-on as the South Africans suffered an early setback. Anneke Bosch was trapped leg-before for nine by Deepti with just 16 runs on the board.\n\nThe end seemed near for the South Africans then.\n\nHowever, Wolvaardt and Luus joined forces to push the hosts on the backfoot.\n\nThe visitors were 29 for one at the lunch break and they batted till the tea break without further damage to take SA to 124 for one.\n\nIn the post-tea session, when their partnership surpassed 138, it also became the highest stand for the tourists against India in Test cricket.\n\nMeanwhile, Luus brought up her maiden Test century, as she became only the second South African to hit a Test ton against India after Mignon du Preez (102) in Mysore in 2014.\n\nEventually, Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur broke the 190-run alliance, getting rid of Luus when the score was 206 for two.\n\nThe dismissal brought Kapp together with the skipper and they batted out the remainder of the day. India took the new ball just three overs before stumps but did not do any wonders.

Sune Luus (65, 164b, 6x4,1x6)) and Marizanne Kapp (69 n.o, 125b, 8x4)) embodied that image at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on day two of the one-off Test between India and South Africa on Saturday.\n\nAfter India declared with 603/6 on the board, South Africa had the unenviable task of keeping a blood-thirsty Indian spin arsenal at bay while braving heat and humidity like they'd never experienced before.\n\nSkipper Laura Wolvaardt and Anneke Bosch got off to an assured start in the six overs of play the side got before lunch.\n\nHarmanpreet Kaur deployed an over of spin with Sneh Rana sharing the new ball, but the openers saw her off safely. India has managed to cut Wolvaardt's opportunities to whip out her signature cover drive, something the captain had prepared for in the run-up to the fixture.\n\nPost lunch, a battle ensued between Sneh and Wolvaardt in the eighth over. With a tight field in place anticipating errors from the skipper, Sneh began with fuller deliveries to try and test the skipper on the pads and to draw out a shot.\n\nSneh appealed for LBW off the second delivery courtesy of a turning delivery that looked like it had rapped the right-hander on the pad.\n\nThe review showed India woefully off the mark with the ball missing the leg stump by a mile. The Indians laughed it off, with Rajeshwari Gayakwad pulling Sneh's leg for the blip.\n\nBut it would be the Indian offie who had the last laugh when she reduced an otherwise graceful classical batter like Wolvaardt to an awkwardly bent mess as a low ball struck her on the pads.\n\nSneh later revealed that she particularly cherished this wicket, having manifested it in training leading into the game.\n\nSneh Rana celebrates the wicket of South Africa's Wolvaardt in their one-off Test at the M.A Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. | Photo Credit: B.

Jothi Ramalingam / The Hindu\n\nBosch's resistance continued with the ball progressively coming onto the bat nicely. Harmanpreet tested the Proteas with tight fields allowing no room to find runs. Bosch and Luus, who came in at number three, were happy to allow India its experiments, only bothering to punish the oddball in their slot.\n\nPooja Vastrakar was given plenty of protection on the offside to curb any use of the shorter boundary side and to get on the visitor's nerves just a little. Bosch eventually replied with a six, smoking Rajeshwari over long-on for six.\n\nSouth Africa could not score at the pace India had managed so effortlessly for three and a half sessions. One's wicket held more value than any audacious runs. Luus took on Deepti, picking her lines perfectly to place the ball in the gaps. A few overs later, she smashed Sneh for a six, a clean strike over long-on.\n\nRELATED: India Women registers highest Test team total during encounter against South Africa Women\n\nSouth African batters had a spin camp a few weeks ago, keeping key assignments in the subcontinent including a T20 World Cup in mind. The dividends were there for all to see.\n\nSneh then got India the breakthrough, with a back-of-a-length delivery to Bosch moving outside off, She drew a shot out of the South African who reluctantly bit the bait and edged the ball to Deepti at first slip. Kapp joined Luus in the middle and India went on to hit a brick wall for most part of the afternoon.\n\nMarizanne Kapp and Sune Luus' partnership frustrated India for most part of the afternoon in their one-off Test in Chennai. | Photo Credit: B.

Jothi Ramalingam / The Hindu\n\nThe pair went on to a 93-run stand in 176 balls, wearing the Indian attack out. Luus revealed that Smriti Mandhana walked up to her and asked if she should bring herself on with the ball (Smriti had dismissed Luus for her first international wicket in the second ODI a few days ago in Bengaluru).\n\nWhile the mood was light, the burden of seeing out the day was on Luus and Kapp's shoulders and the two played their parts to perfection. Luus took no risks, deadbatting and defending anything tempting.\n\nAs promised, Smriti even came on to bowl a couple of overs of right-arm medium pace, but in vain. The visitors were comfortably settled with the pitch - despite visible wear and tear - offering little to no assistance for the bowler, regardless of pace or spin.\n\nDeepti believed she had Luus trapped leg before in the 43rd over and reviewed a not out call only to find the impact well outside off. A couple of deliveries later, Sneh gave the former South African skipper a lifeline on 44 when she dropped her at first slip.\n\nLuus eventually brought up her maiden Test fifty and her first in the last 26 international outings with an elegant sweep to square leg for four.\n\nKapp, at the other end, underlined why she was in the form of her life, maintaining a one-day strike rate as she kept the Protean scoreboard ticking.\n\nALSO READ: IND-W vs SA-W, One-off Test: Shafali Verma, Smriti Mandhana maraud South Africa as India plunders 525/4 on Day 1\n\nThe allrounder thumped the ball past the nonstriker for four to bring up her own half century.\n\nDeepti gave India a breather removing Luus, caught leg before with the ball heading into the middle stump.

Jothi Ramalingam / The Hindu\n\nBy this time, Kapp, her shirt soaked in sweat, was starting to feel the pinch of the conditions. She needed physio attention for cramps in the back and leg and plenty of hydration but managed to see the day through unscathed with Nadine de Klerk, the pair putting on an unbeaten 38-run stand for fifth wicket, with South Africa ending day two at 236/4 in 72 overs.\n\nEarlier, Harmanpreet and Richa Ghosh picked up from where India left off at the end of day one, each quickly getting to their half centuries. This was particularly sweet for the India captain who finally registered her maiden fifty-plus score in the format in her ninth batting inning.\n\nThe Indian dugout looked like it wanted to give its batters time to get to their centuries, however, the skipper in the 113th over to Tumi Sekhukune courtesy a brilliant review from the side. Sekhukune sent a length ball angling into Harmanpreet which hit her on the pads.\n\nThe umpire was unconvinced and the call went upstairs where the ball was seen heading right into the middle of middle stump.\n\nMlaba then took out Richa three overs later with the Indian keeper-batter trying to sweep in vain, copping the ball on her pads. A review found the ball heading into the leg stump and brought the curtains down on Richa and India's innings, the declaration call coming from the dugout.\n\nBRIEF SCORES Stumps, day two: India 603/6d in 115.1 overs (Richa Ghosh 86, Harmanpreet Kaur 69, Delmi Tucker 2/141) leads South Africa 236/4 in 72 Overs (Marizanne Kapp 69, Sune Luus 65, Sneh Rana 3/61) by 367 runs.

This was before Wolvaardt struck a confident drive through mid-off in the first over of the innings by Renuka Singh.\n\nHowever, Rana - who got the ball to spin more than any other spinner - got the first breakthrough in the eighth over when she bowled one rare short ball. But it kept low and Wolvaardt completely missed her pull to be trapped lbw. Bosch and Luus stayed on for the next 23 overs, stitching 63 runs. However, Bosch, who hit four fours and a six, fell a few overs before tea. Rana was at it once again. After the previous ball spun sharply, Rana bowled one full outside off. Anticipating the turn, Bosch leaned forward and nicked it to Deepti Sharma at slip.\n\nAt 96 for 2, South Africa found stability via Kapp and Luus who blended caution with aggression. Luus respected the good deliveries, scoring almost equally on the off and leg side. In all, she scored 65 off 164 balls that included six fours and one six over long-on against Rana.\n\nThe duo put on 93 before Deepti broke the stand when she beat Luus' inside edge and trapped her lbw. Luus reviewed the on-field decision but it was in vain. Delmi Tucker became Rana's third victim when Richa Ghosh took a sharp catch to dismiss her for an eight-ball duck.\n\nKapp, like Luus, played more off the back foot and scored predominantly on the off side, with seven of her eight fours coming in that area. She reached 50 off 87 balls and remained unbeaten on 69 off 125 at stumps. She fought cramps and a stiff back towards the end of the final session, but didn't throw her wicket away.\n\nOnce Tucker departed, Nadine de Klerk joined Kapp with the pair stitching an unbroken 38-run stand off 56 balls. De Klerk showed good intent in the final hour and hit five fours in her unbeaten 27 off 28 balls.\n\nEarlier, Ghosh and Harmanpreet Kaur started sedately but soon converted their starts into half-centuries. The pair stretched their stand to 143 runs. Harmanpreet made 69 off 115 balls before being dismissed in the 15th over of the day when fast bowler Tumi Sekhukhune trapped her in front to leave India at 593 for 5.\n\nGhosh hit seven more boundaries on Saturday, 16 in all, her 90-ball innings, using her strong wrists to good use to play powerful cut shots. She fell for her career-best 86 when she missed a sweep off left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba and was lbw.", "source": {"uri": "island.lk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thilina_walpola@island.lk", "name": "Thilina Walpola", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boundary (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renuka_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renuka Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke_Bosch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anneke Bosch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Wolvaardt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laura Wolvaardt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pooja_Vastrakar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pooja Vastrakar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delmi_Tucker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delmi Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richa_Ghosh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richa Ghosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonkululeko_Mlaba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonkululeko Mlaba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumi_Sekhukhune", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tumi Sekhukhune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine_de_Klerk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nadine de Klerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmanpreet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harmanpreet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duck (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "http://island.lk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marizanne-Kapp-1000x600.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693057", "eventUri": "eng-9693057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Rana and Deepti Sharma got the job done with ease.\n\nRana's figures were the second-best in a Women's Test innings for India after record-holder Neetu David's eight for 53 against England in Jamshedpur in 1995.\n\nOverall, Rana holds the third-best Test innings figures, with Australia's Ashleigh Gardner (eight for 66) preceding her.\n\nTrailing by 337 runs, the Indians enforced follow-on as the South Africans suffered an early setback. Anneke Bosch was trapped leg-before for nine by Deepti with just 16 runs on the board.\n\nThe end seemed near for the South Africans then.\n\nHowever, Wolvaardt and Luus joined forces to push the hosts on the backfoot.\n\nThe visitors were 29 for one at the lunch break and they batted till the tea break without further damage to take SA to 124 for one.\n\nIn the post-tea session, when their partnership surpassed 138, it also became the highest stand for the tourists against India in Test cricket.\n\nMeanwhile, Luus brought up her maiden Test century, as she became only the second South African to hit a Test ton against India after Mignon du Preez (102) in Mysore in 2014.\n\nEventually, Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur broke the 190-run alliance, getting rid of Luus when the score was 206 for two.\n\nThe dismissal brought Kapp together with the skipper and they batted out the remainder of the day.

South Africa ended the day at 232/3 after being put on follow-on. However, India's Sneh Rana stole the show with her eight-wicket haul during the 2nd innings. Currently, South Africa trail by 105 runs after they were bundled out for 266 runs in their first innings. However, they put up a spirited show in their 2nd innings and trail by 105 runs in response to India's mammoth total of 603 runs.\n\nIndia's off-spinner Sneh Rana ran through South Africa's batting line up as she made full use of the spinning conditions on offer at the M Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The visitors managed to add only 30 runs to their overnight total from Day 2. Sneh Rana registered her name in record books as she became only the 2nd Indian and third overall bowler to pick an eight-wicket haul in Women's Tests.\n\nSneh Rana reflected on her performance and how the pitch played on Day 3.\n\n\"It was initially challenging for the spinners because the ball wasn't turning much. Later on, enjoyed as we got it to spin. Mindset is clear - to bowl in the right areas. We were trying hard for wickets. We are going for the kill - that's our mindset. Laura and Kapp are two of best batters in the world. They have done really well in the past. They played really well, and you got to give them credit. We (bowlers) have been complementing each other and even the fielders have supported us,\" Sneh Rana told the broadcasters.\n\nSouth Africa were trailing by 337 runs and the Indians enforced the follow-on as the visitors suffered an early setback. Anneke Bosch was trapped leg-before for nine by Deepti with just 16 runs on the board. The end seemed near for the South Africans then. However, Wolvaardt and Luus joined forces to push the hosts onto the backfoot. Meanwhile, Luus brought up her maiden Test century, as she became only the second South African to hit a Test ton against India after Mignon du Preez (102) in Mysore in 2014.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\u00e9_Luus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun\u00e9 Luus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow-on", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Follow-on"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Off spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke_Bosch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anneke Bosch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mignon_du_Preez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mignon du Preez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mysore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mysore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/sneh-rana-304755591-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=8WO7nNtyQVIH.gbKedmo3zV7yL7ndb10", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693057", "eventUri": "eng-9693057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

We saw videos of their top four-five batters and planned against them,\" Rana told reporters after second day's play.\n\n\"There was not enough turn initially on this track, and we had to use our fingers and hard grip quite a lot. But, as the wicket kept deteriorating, we saw more (variable) bounce and turn. There is always a challenge with the wickets, and we are always prepared for it.\"\n\nShe was also the star in the previous Test against Australia last December in Mumbai, where she took seven wickets in the entire encounter.\n\n\"It's been an amazing feeling so far. I tried to pick up from where I had left off (against Australia), aiming to play with the same focus,\" she said.\n\nFor her, there is no magic mantra but sheer hard work.\n\n\"It's not magic but sheer hard work that has paid off in this contest. Having performed against Australia, it was a challenge for me to keep up with that performance. Thus, I was looking to deliver that.\"\n\nAlthough there was not enough turn on the Chepauk pitch, discussing her bowling plans, Sneh stated that using her stock balls more often helped her.\n\nSneh gave credit to the South African batters for making the most out of the good Chepauk batting surface but expressed her confidence in getting the job done on Sunday.\n\n\"The opponent batters are also out there to bat, and the pitch was helping them. They have played really beautifully, especially how they have taken control of the innings,\" she concluded.\n\nIndian off-spinners bowled exceptionally well: Sune Luus\n\nMeanwhile, South African all-rounder Sune Luus was all praise for the Indian off-spinners for having bowled beautifully, which included Rana and Deepti Sharma (1-41).\n\n\"The two (Indian) off-spinners bowled exceptionally well. They were hitting the spots, and we didn't know whether to go back or forward or stay put,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked about her 93-run partnership with Kapp and the discussions, Sune conceded that she had complete faith in the latter's ability and current form.\n\n\"Kapp and I discussed that we just need to build a partnership. Our best chance was to stay out there as long as we could.\n\n\"Kapp has quite some experience in Tests and has a lot of runs under her belt. I had full confidence in her.

India's off-spinner Sneh Rana had earlier taken eight wickets to bowl South Africa out for 266 in their first innings, trailing India's 603 for six by 337 runs.\n\nSouth Africa still trail India by 105 runs.Sneh Rana's exemplary eight for 77 in the first innings hastened South Africa's collapse. In South Africa's second innings, Luus, with 109 runs off 203 balls including 18 fours, and skipper Laura Wolvaardt, who is unbeaten on 93 from 252 balls with 12 boundaries, played pivotal roles in their fight back.\n\nStarting from their overnight score of 236 for four, South Africa's Marizanne Kapp (74) and Nadine de Klerk (39) could not sustain their momentum. Kapp fell to Rana, sparking a collapse that saw the team all out after adding just 17 more runs. Rana and Deepti Sharma were instrumental in wrapping up the innings.\n\nRana's first-innings figures were the second-best in a Women's Test innings for India, behind Neetu David's eight for 53 against England in 1995. Rana now holds the third-best figures overall in a Women's Test innings, with Australia's Ashleigh Gardner's eight for 66 taking the second spot.\n\nTrailing by 337 runs, India enforced the follow-on. The South Africans suffered an early setback when Anneke Bosch was trapped leg-before for nine by Deepti with the score at just 16. It seemed the end was near for South Africa at that point.\n\nHowever, Wolvaardt and Luus steadied the innings. They took South Africa to 29 for one at lunch and batted through to tea without further damage. By tea, South Africa was 124 for one.\n\nTheir partnership became the highest stand for South Africa against India in Test cricket when it crossed 138 runs. Luus achieved a milestone by bringing up her maiden Test century. She became only the second South African to score a Test century against India, following Mignon du Preez's 102 in Mysore in 2014.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Sneh Rana emerged as the standout among the bowlers, claiming three of the four Proteas' wickets, including the crucial dismissal of Sune Luus, who batted impressively during her 65-run knock in the middle.\n\nIt was all about Rana in the first hour of Day 3 though, as she bagged five of the remaining six South African wickets to register her best bowling figures of 8/77 in 25.3 overs. This splendid achievement marked her as only the second Indian woman to claim eight scalps in an innings, following Neetu David against the English (8/53 in 1995).\n\nCheck Here: IND-W vs SA-W: Sneh Rana continues red ball dominance, claiming eight wicket haul against South Africa in Chennai Test\n\nKapp and de Klerk's tenure at the crease was brief, which was majorly compounded by Rana's impeccable bowling spell. What followed was a staggering collapse of the remainder of the batting line-up. The last five South African batters could only contribute a combined total of nine runs as the Proteas folded for 266.\n\nIt was a straightforward decision for skipper, Harmanpreet Kaur, to enforce a follow-on, who anticipated the Indian bowlers to further assert dominance on a deteriorating pitch. This expectation seemed further justified when opener, Anneke Bosch, got trapped in front to a delivery that kept exceedingly low, giving Deepti Sharma her third wicket of the match. However, what ensued was a remarkable blend of resilience, determination, and grit, served up to the Indians during what was already shaping up to be a taxing day in the field for them.\n\nLuus and skipper, Laura Wolvaardt, persevered relentlessly, gradually wearing down the Indian bowlers and capitalizing on any loose deliveries offered to them. Their partnership exhausted the resources of the Indian bowling attack, which showed no signs of yielding wickets as the overs unfolded.\n\nCheck Here: IND-W vs SA-W Fantasy League Tips\n\nIt was only in the 74th over of the innings that a skidding delivery from Harmanpreet breached the defences of Luus, who departed after a commendable 109 off 203, which was her maiden century in the format.

The South African batters now face the challenging task of chipping away at the deficit and batting long to stay competitive in the match.", "source": {"uri": "cricket.one", "dataType": "news", "title": "OneCricket"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sakshi_sharma@cricket.one", "name": "Sakshi Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke_Bosch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anneke Bosch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_women's_national_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa women's national cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_women's_national_cricket_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India women's national cricket team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Wolvaardt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laura Wolvaardt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepti_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepti Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\u00e9_Luus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sun\u00e9 Luus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight_Edge", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Straight Edge", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://onecricketnews.akamaized.net/parth-editor/oc-dashboard/news-images-prod/1719653585102_Untitled design (8).jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693057", "eventUri": "eng-9693057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

For the uninitiated, just 10 days ago Luus had become the maiden international victim of India's new-found wrong-footed 'medium-pace allrounder' that is their vice-captain now.\n\nA session and a half later, it did come down to that. On the match-eve Harmanpreet Kaur had joked, and hoped, that it wouldn't, but it did. Luus and Marizanne Kapp had forced India's hand going into the final hour's play.\n\nThere were no signs of wear and tear yet, but the Day 2 Chepauk wicket was keeping low and beginning to offer turn. And, the hosts had plenty of spinners in their ranks to exploit that to their advantage against the tired South Africans, who had been at the recieving end of the highest innings total ever in a women's Test. In fact Laura Wolvaardt, who had refrained from her trademark drives as she'd anticipated she would have to in Chennai, had just been dismissed to one such rare short ball from Sneh Rana that kept surprisingly low and pinged plumb in front of middle as she went deep in her crease to shape up for an ill-advised pull for the conditions.\n\nIn the attritional post-Lunch session, veteran Rana would go on to claim another vital wicket - that of Wolvaardt's equally fluent fellow opener Anneke Bosch - but the defiance from the Luus-Kapp partnership had left the hosts searching for answers and turning to even the most part-time option of them all.\n\nIt all started with Luus, who showed commendable application and restraint on a pitch with low bounce to wear down India's spinners, especially Rana who was keeping it tight bowling in the stump-to-stump channel or just outside, and also extracting sharp turn on other occasions to sow the seeds of doubt in the batters' minds.\n\nWith a gigantic deficit staring down at the visitors, Luus was just happy to get on the front foot and block most of them out with a straight bat or nudge it around for a single. A lap shot in the vacant fine leg region brought Luus her first boundary in 42 deliveries and she creamed an overpitched one from Deepti Sharma through the covers later in the same over for her second.\n\nAs inviting as they were, the ones generously tossed up by either of the two offspinners would just be stabbed and smothered lunging forward. The frustration was bound to get to the bowlers, and when Rana erred to dish out a slot ball, Luus gleefully accepted the invitation and tonked it over long-on for maximum damage.\n\nThere would be the occasional peach, particularly from Rana. Like the classical offbreak around offstump that turned and bounced just about enough to beat Luus' inside edge as well as the 'keeper, about half an hour before Tea, had South Africans gasping alongside the Indian fielders.\n\n\"I felt like the two offspinners bowled exceptionally today. They were hitting those revs and we didn't know where to go - back or forward - or when the balls were popping or staying low. They've really bowled exceptionally [well],\" Luus said at the end of the second day's play. \"But Kappy and I just decided we needed to just build a partnership. It doesn't matter if you're 0 off 20, 0 off 30. As long as we stay in here, I think we have the best chance...Kappy's got so much experience and her game is so sorted at the moment that I had full confidence in her to stick with me and to just get through that period. No bowler is good enough to bowl on the spot every single ball for how many overs. So we knew at some point she [Rana] is going to give us something, either just to get off strike or to get that boundary. But we just needed to be patient.\"\n\nKapp, with whom Luus put on a 93-run stand in 29 overs following Bosch's dismissal, was equally up for the grind too. She played predominantly off the back foot and looked more proactive, but interspersed between some perfectly timed off-side strokes were a few uppish drives that somehow evaded the fielders. Luus admitted she had to help Kapp dial it down a notch with the follow-on threat still lurking.\n\n\"I think because she's coming off so many runs at the moment and she's hitting that purple patch in career, there was a lot of conversation about just me keeping her calm today,\" Luus revealed. \"In that space, you feel like you can just hit every ball... But she knew that she needed to be patient, and she still had a long way to go. So I think my job today was really just to have those conversations with her. I think some of the balls I went down on the pitch just tapped the pitch and just said a bit of words to her just to keep her calm. When there was two or three balls left and she just needed to be level-headed today and she just asked me to help her out with that. So I think those were the conversations we had today.\"\n\nIndia's desperation for a wicket grew, and boundary balls made a more frequent appearance even from an on-song Rana. A well-set Luus was also down to exploring the option of going square of the wicket now with the sweeps to unsettle the spinners. Aggressive field settings were used, and shuffled often, but a handful of chances were also either put down or fell marginally short to add to India's frustration.\n\nLuus brought up her fifty in 131 balls while Kapp took 87 to hers, riding her luck. Together, the duo managed to keep the home team and their aspirations of triggering a collapse at bay. As it turned out, the extended evening session was indeed the most productive for the visitors with 130 runs coming off it at 3.51 an over.\n\nIn this tug-of-war, Deepti did finally manage to break apart the threatening stand when she got one to spin back in and ping Luus on the pads as she tried to defend yet another time in her 164-ball block-a-thon. With a back that still hasn't recovered enough to take the bowling workload, Kapp on the other hand fought through cramps to keep the fight going alongside Luus, and later Nadine de Klerk until the umpires finally called stumps on an absorbing day's play.\n\nFrequently seeking shade under umbrellas during drinks, hydration breaks, and some help with stretches, both Luus and Kaap's fight wasn't just against the 11 in the field in a slightly different shade of Test whites. In hindsight Luus could joke about it all, stating that Perth - where South Africa played their last one-off Test four months ago in peak Australian summer - \"felt like winter\" in comparison to Chennai.\n\n\"Playing in India, it's one of the toughest Test matches you'll play in your career. I think Perth felt like winter when I looked back now. Today was really one of the hottest days I've ever experienced in my - I don't know how long - career. So it really was a a good challenge as a cricketer today.\n\n\"I think mentally you just had to stuck in there and just kind of forget about the heat however you can. Just try and set every ball. Try and concentrate as much as you can. In terms of coming from the ODIs we had four days in between. It feels long but we only had two days to prepare for the Test. I think your game plan is just to bat longer and to I guess be patient and have a good defence.\n\n\"We needed to bat through the whole day, get some partnerships going... The big thing was to just be patient. [Anything] outside off - just be patient with that, not to go fishing too early on and just keep the straight one out and just make sure that your defence is very good and every shot you play is just very solid and how you planned it.\"\n\nWith Kapp still out in the middle to similarly guide the batting that is to follow, South Africa can hope to keep chipping at India's mammoth 603. Even though it will still prove a pretty steep climb, Luus and Kapp have shown that it isn't exactly insurmountable either.", "source": {"uri": "cricbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

With a day left, the Proteas still trail by 105 runs.\n\nDay 3 is termed the moving day, but during the India vs South Africa Test, it was anything but. India Women were already on top before the day's play, with the Proteas trailing by 367 runs. Having already taken 3 wickets the day before, Sneh Rana came in and ripped South Africa apart. She alone took five wickets to end with an 8-wicket haul, while Deepti Sharma chipped in with a wicket as well.\n\nSouth Africa's epic collapse\n\nThe Proteas lost 6 wickets for 30 runs in just 12.3 overs. A collapse that you don't normally see. Team India decided to send the visitors in for a bat with an early finish in mind. It looked like Harmanpreet Kaur and Co. would wrap up the match by the third session.\n\nBut skipper Laura Wolvaardt and Sune Luus had other things in mind. Despite a poor show in the first inning and losing an early wicket (Anneke Bosch), South Africa weren't ready to give up. After a disappointing outing in the first dig, Wolvaardt was ready to give her all.\n\nShe decided that the Indian bowlers weren't dismissing her today, and she batted the whole day, facing 252 balls. Luus, who'd missed out on a ton in the first inning (65), took the proactive approach. She brought up her maiden Test ton in 179 balls, becoming the fourth South African women's cricketer to score a century.\n\nUnfortunately for her, she'll soon depart. The 190-run stand was broken at last, and that too was due to a slice of luck for India. Bowling her sixth over of the day, Harmapreet bowled a ball outside off that spin, skidded, and kept low to rattle the stumps. Luus walked back with a 109-run knock and a standing ovation from teammates and the crowd.\n\nWolvaardt ended the day, 7 runs away from her maiden century as well. While Luus' ton was more about counterattacking, the South African captain represented an old-school style of play, grit, and determination.

After India declared their innings following a monumental Test score, South Africa's response shimmered with improvement from their overnight stance.\n\nIndia's pacers, relentless in their quest for breakthroughs, were met with sturdy resistance, prompting the astute Harmanpreet Kaur to summon her spinners. The spinners spun webs of opportunity, yet India's bowlers saw many golden chances slip away, including a couple of elusive runout opportunities. Amidst this, Sune Luus shone brightly with a composed 65 off 164 balls before being ensnared by Deepti Sharma's wiles (1/40).\n\nIn the morning session, India fortified their dominance by adding 78 runs to their overnight tally, ascending to a towering total of 603/6. Harmanpreet (69), with grace and determination, reached her maiden Test fifty, while Richa Ghosh (86), with equal flair, notched her second, though both missed the chance to turn these fifties into centuries. India's declaration, a strategic move, came in the wake of Richa's departure.\n\nThe post-lunch session unveiled a pitch full of surprises. Laura Wolvaardt (20) was ensnared by a low bounce, and Anneke Bosch, amidst a flurry of powerful strikes and near-misses, succumbed to Sneh Rana for a spirited 39 off 73 balls. India, poised for more, saw another chance slip when Richa dropped a catch off Luus.\n\nWith Kapp steadfast at the crease, South Africa's primary aim on day three will be to stave off the follow-on. The pitch, with its hints of inconsistent bounce, promises to weave a compelling narrative into the coming play. As the tension mounts and the stakes rise, fans are bracing themselves for the exhilarating day of cricket that lies ahead.\n\nBrief Scores:\n\nSouth Africa 236/4 (Stumps, Day 2): Marizanne Kapp 69*, Sune Luus 65, Senh Rana 3/61. India 603/6 declared: Shafali Verma 205, Smriti Mandhana 149, Richa Ghosh 86, Harmanpreet Kaur 69, and Jemmimah Rodrigues 55.

The 30-year-old off-spinner finished second day with figures of 3/61, which included the prized wickets of the Proteas' opening pair, skipper Laura Wolvaardt (20) and Anneke Bosch (39), along with Delmi Tucker (0). South Africa ended the day at 236 for 4 in reply to India's gigantic first innings score of 603 for 6.\n\n\"My plan is simple -- do channel bowling and use more of your stock balls. We saw videos of their top four-five batters and planned against them,\" Rana told reporters after second day's play.\n\nAlso Read | Argentina vs Peru, Copa America 2024 Live Streaming and Match Time in IST: How to Watch Free Live Telecast of ARG vs PER on TV and Online Stream Details of Football Match in India.\n\n\"There was not enough turn initially on this track, and we had to use our fingers and hard grip quite a lot. But, as the wicket kept deteriorating, we saw more (variable) bounce and turn.

I tried to pick up from where I had left off (against Australia), aiming to play with the same focus,\" she said.\n\nFor her, there is no magic mantra but sheer hardwork. \"It's not magic but sheer hard work that has paid off in this contest. Having performed against Australia, it was a challenge for me to keep up with that performance. Thus, I was looking to deliver that.\"\n\nAlthough there was not enough turn on the Chepauk pitch, discussing her bowling plans, Sneh stated that using her stock balls more often helped her.\n\nSneh gave credit to the South African batters for making the most out of the good Chepauk batting surface but expressed her confidence in getting the job done on Sunday.\n\n\"The opponent batters are also out there to bat, and the pitch was helping them. They have played really beautifully, especially how they have taken control of the innings,\" she concluded. Indian off-spinners bowled exceptionally well: Sune Luus ===================================================================\n\nMeanwhile, South African all-rounder Sune Luus was all praise for the Indian off-spinners for having bowled beautifully, which included Rana and Deepti Sharma (1-41).\n\n\"The two (Indian) off-spinners bowled exceptionally well today.

Our best chance was to stay out there as long as we could.\n\n\"Kapp has quite some experience in Tests and has a lot of runs under her belt. I had full confidence in her.

Rana, bowling after almost five months for India on Day 2 of the women's Test at Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium, plotted Wolvaardt's dismissal with a clever delivery to end South Africa openers' resistance in reply to India's first innings 603/6, the highest total in women's Test.\n\nSouth Africa ended the day on 236/4, trailing by 367 runs.\n\nRana also accounted for the crucial wickets of Anneke Bosch (39) and Delmi Tucker (0) to finish as the most successful bowler on Day 2, on a wicket that started assisting spin post lunch. Wolvaardt and Bosch tackled the bowling well early to reach 29 in six overs before lunch.\n\nHowever, success for India came when Sneh Rana delivered a blow in the second over after lunch by removing the SA captain on the final ball by trapping Wolvaardt in front (20 -- 36b). India had to wait 22 overs for the next wicket, Rana again drawing Bosch (39 -- 73b) to edge to slips where Deepti Sharma took the catch.\n\nThe experienced Sune Luus and Marizzane Kapp then raised a 92-run partnership to frustrate the Indian bowlers. The duo played with caution and collected runs with ease. India pacers Pooja Vastrakar and Renuka Singh bowled nine and seven overs respectively, but found no success for 29.1 overs.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad, the most experienced bowler, failed to make an impact. In the wicketless 16 overs she bowled on Day 2, she leaked 50 runs. India's bowling charge was led by Rana, who found support in off-spinner Deepti Sharma.\n\nDeepti broke the Kapp-Luus stand by dismissing Luus for a patient 65 off 164 balls. The last wicket of the day for India came when Rana removed Delmi Tucker, having her caught behind by Rich Ghosh to make it 198/4.\n\nAt close, Kapp, with eight boundaries, was batting on 69 with Nadine de Klerk on 27.\n\nIn the morning, India resumed on 525/4 with Harmanpreet (69) and Richa Ghosh (86) together. India declared innings at 603/6 on the dismissal of the Indian wicketkeeper.\n\nAfter the day's play, Sneh Rana said: \"It was so satisfying to take Wolvaardt's wicket. The openers were playing well and we just wanted to get the first breakthrough. It was Wolvaardt and I was elated to get that.\"\n\nRana had scalped a match-winning seven wickets in her last Test, against Australia at the Wankhede Stadium in December. \"Australia is the No.1 team in the world and doing well against them is always special. Coming back to the Indian team and bowling is a great feeling. A lot of hard work has gone into preparing. We had a camp and also an inter-zonal tournament with the red-ball. My plan is always very simple with the red ball, that is to bowl the stock ball and go for wickets. We had done some homework on their batters, which helped,\" said Rana, who pointed out that initially in the day there wasn't much turn in the wicket, but later turn and bounce came into the picture.\n\nWith the wicket expected to afford more turn on Day 3, the Indian spinners will hope to quickly take the six wickets in the SA first innings and force the follow on.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delmi_Tucker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delmi Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anneke_Bosch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anneke Bosch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._A._Chidambaram_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M.

They stitched a near-century stand to stay alive in the contest.\n\nThe visitors remained unfazed about India's gigantic total and went about their business calmly on Saturday. Proteas openers Laura Wolvaardt (20) and Anneke Bosch (39) were undeterred by the scorching heat in their seven overs at the MA Chidambaram Stadium as they began their innings in smooth fashion. Both got off the mark with a four and went on to hit the pacers for boundaries occasionally.\n\nTo separate the duo, India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who had closely observed the passage of play in the morning session, was tempted to bring in the ever reliable Sneh Rana (3-61) on the spin-friendly surface. Right after the lunch break, Sneh hit the nail on the head by giving India their first breakthrough.\n\nThe right-arm off-break bowler looked determined to get rid of South Africa captain Wolvaardt. In the eighth over, she first lost a review when a sharply turning delivery appeared to be on the path of Wolvaardt's stumps. Three deliveries later, she finally got her prized wicket as the ball kept low and did not turn as much as it did in the previous deliveries, trapping Wolvaardt LBW.\n\nSpeaking to the media after the match, Sneh, who was the pick of the bowlers, said: \"Laura's wicket was the most satisfactory one because I have been manifesting her wicket for a long time.\"\n\nAfter losing Wolvaardt, Bosch and Luus kept India at bay in a well-curated stand of 63 runs off 137 balls. It was Sneh who once again did the job for the hosts, dismissing Bosch as her fellow offie Deepti Sharma took a catch at first slip.\n\nThe day's highlight was the alliance between Luus and Kapp, who made most of the dropped catches and missed chances. They took time to settle in and shared a crucial 93-run partnership for the third wicket. The pair showed defiance against the Indian bowlers with their good techniques and kept SA in the contest.\n\nBefore the curtains were brought down on day's play, Kapp and Nadine de Klerk (27*) survived the last phase to remain unbeaten. South Africa amassed 130 runs in the final session of the day and will be satisfied with their fightback.\n\nEarlier, after being completely outplayed and conceding 525 runs on the opening day, the South African bowlers encountered another dazzling display of batting from the Indians - Harmanpreet (69, 115b; 4x4) and Richa Ghosh (86, 90b; 16x4) -motored to their fifties as the duo added 143 runs off 154 balls for the fifth wicket.

Promptly, two deliveries later, Wolvaardt went for an ill-advised pull shot on a pitch with low bounce. Rana expertly pulled back her length slightly and the ball shot through low. The result was as plumb an LBW dismissal as you could see. The seed of doubt didn't even have enough time to sprout, and she had to walk back. It was the kind of delivery that could have easily demoralised a tired side, for the kind of threat that was potentially to come.\n\nHowever, the visitors, after four sessions of toiling in the Chennai heat, fought back. Sune Luus dug in. Marizanne Kapp continued her rich vein of run-scoring form. Two half-centuries were scored, with the ball occasionally spitting off the surface, and India too were made to work hard. The hosts are still very much in control with a lead of 367 runs, but 236/4 at stumps was a solid effort on a day when things could have easily unravelled. South Africa said... not today.\n\nEarlier in the day, records tumbled at Chepauk as India became the first ever team to cross 600 in the history of women's Test cricket on Saturday. India declared on 603/6 after 115.1 overs, a few minutes after they broke the record set by Australia just earlier this year (575/9 in Perth). Unfortunately for South Africa, they were at the receiving end on both occasions.\n\nSouth Africa's fightback started with Luus neutralising the spinners with impressive front-foot play. She read the length well, going forward a majority of the time, but also rocking back on the rare occasion Rana and Co dropped it short. \"Glad it looked that way,\" Luus told the broadcasters when they told her she looked to be batting with a lot of clarity. \"Hitting the ball under the eyes as much as possible was key, every time we reached out to play away from the body was when we got under trouble.\"\n\nElaborating on the visitors' gameplan Luus added: \"I don't think you can play for the one that goes low. We used the depth of the crease and kept a straight bat instead of going across. We had to be patient outside off and not go fishing, keep the straight one out, and trust your defence.\"\n\nAs much as the Indian spinners threatened, the weather too was a strong foe for South Africa. \"Weather in Perth (earlier this year when South Africa played a Test there) felt like winter compared to Chennai today, it was one of the hottest days of cricket I have faced in my career,\" Luus said later. \"But this is what we train for, we run and go to the gym, to be ready for such situations.\"\n\nLuus and Rana both had immense respect for what each of the teams tried to accomplish on Day 2, in what was often a gripping contest. The Indian spinner conceded that the South Africans batted beautifully but was confident enough on the state of play given that the pitch was starting to offer more and more assistance as the day went on. Rana, who was once again impressive with the red-ball, was India's best bowler on the day. With a bit more luck (a couple of edges that were put down or evaded the close-in fielders by inches), her figures would have been better than 3/61.\n\n\"A lot of hard work has gone into (being good with the red ball). The plan is simple for me, I just want to bowl in a good channel and use my stock ball as frequently as possible,\" Rana said, adding that the wicket of Wolvaardt was very satisfactory because she was manifesting it. On a pitch that definitely had assistance for spinners but got easier to bat on once the batters got their eye in, Rana said that the key was to have a hard grip and impart revolutions a bit more than they normally would.\n\nIndeed, last over of the day, things ended on an ominous note for South Africa. A well-set Kapp was left bamboozled by a couple of length deliveries from Rana, that turned and bounced viciously. Like a good episode of a TV series, the day ended on an intriguing note.\n\nBrief scores: South Africa (1st Innings): 236/4 in 72 overs (Marizanne Kapp 69 not out, Sune Luus 65; Sneh Rana 3/61) vs India: 603/6 declared", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vinayakk_mohanarangan@indianexpress.com", "name": "Vinayakk Mohanarangan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chepauk", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chepauk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chepauk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneh_Rana_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sneh Rana (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stump_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stump (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun\u00e9_Luus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sun\u00e9 Luus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marizanne_Kapp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marizanne Kapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First-class cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/IND-SA-Test.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693057", "eventUri": "eng-9693057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Photograph: BCCI WomenX\n\nSenior India spinner Sneh Rana depended on channel bowling to get three wickets on the second day of the one-off Test against South Africa but also benefitted from the variable bounce due to considerable deterioration of the Chepauk track.\n\nThe 30-year-old off-spinner finished second day with figures of 3/61, which included the prized wickets of the Proteas' opening pair, skipper Laura Wolvaardt (20) and Anneke Bosch (39), along with Delmi Tucker (0).\n\nSouth Africa ended the day at 236 for 4 in reply to India's gigantic first innings score of 603 for 6.\n\n\"My plan is simple -- do channel bowling and use more of your stock balls. We saw videos of their top four-five batters and planned against them,\" Rana told reporters after second day's play.\n\n\"There was not enough turn initially on this track, and we had to use our fingers and hard grip quite a lot. But, as the wicket kept deteriorating, we saw more (variable) bounce and turn. There is always a challenge with the wickets, and we are always prepared for it.\"\n\nShe was also the star in the previous Test against Australia last December in Mumbai, where she took seven wickets in the entire encounter.\n\n\"It's been an amazing feeling so far. I tried to pick up from where I had left off (against Australia), aiming to play with the same focus,\" she said.\n\nFor her, there is no magic mantra but sheer hardwork.\n\n\"It's not magic but sheer hard work that has paid off in this contest. Having performed against Australia, it was a challenge for me to keep up with that performance. Thus, I was looking to deliver that.\"\n\nAlthough there was not enough turn on the Chepauk pitch, discussing her bowling plans, Sneh stated that using her stock balls more often helped her.\n\nSneh gave credit to the South African batters for making the most out of the good Chepauk batting surface but expressed her confidence in getting the job done on Sunday.\n\n\"The opponent batters are also out there to bat, and the pitch was helping them. They have played really beautifully, especially how they have taken control of the innings,\" she concluded.\n\n\\Meanwhile, South African all-rounder Sune Luus was all praise for the Indian off-spinners for having bowled beautifully, which included Rana and Deepti Sharma (1-41).\n\n\"The two (Indian) off-spinners bowled exceptionally well today. They were hitting the spots, and we didn't know whether to go back or forward or stay put,\" she realised.\n\nWhen asked about her 93-run partnership with Kapp and the discussions, Sune conceded that she had complete faith in the latter's ability and current form.\n\n\"But, Kapp and I discussed that we just need to build a partnership. Our best chance was to stay out there as long as we could.\n\n\"Kapp has quite some experience in Tests and has a lot of runs under her belt. I had full confidence in her.

They had a subtle start until Deepti Sharma hit right on the pads to send Anneke Bosch back to the pavilion.\n\nDespite a steady 39-run knock in the first innings, the opener fell cheaply to a mere 9 (2x4) in the second.\n\nTrailing by 308 in the mid-day, the duo effortlessly accelerated the innings post-lunch.\n\nWithout losing a wicket, South Africa dominated the home side by securing 95 runs in the second session.\n\nWith a mammoth run set on the board, Sune Luus braved the opponents by hammering a century. Despite the home side's efforts to chip away at the top order by trying various bowling options, Wolvaardt and Luus stitched together a record-breaking 190-run partnership, the highest-ever for the South Africa women's team in Test cricket.\n\nWhile South Africa appeared to be in full control, Indian skipper Harmanpreet Kaur provided a much-needed breakthrough by hitting the timber perfectly to dismiss Luus for 109 (18x4).

We saw videos of their top four-five batters and planned against them,\" Rana told reporters after second day's play.\n\n\"There was not enough turn initially on this track, and we had to use our fingers and hard grip quite a lot. But, as the wicket kept deteriorating, we saw more (variable) bounce and turn. There is always a challenge with the wickets, and we are always prepared for it.\" She was also the star in the previous Test against Australia last December in Mumbai, where she took seven wickets in the entire encounter.\n\n\"It's been an amazing feeling so far. I tried to pick up from where I had left off (against Australia), aiming to play with the same focus,\" she said.\n\nFor her, there is no magic mantra but sheer hardwork.\n\n\"It's not magic but sheer hard work that has paid off in this contest. Having performed against Australia, it was a challenge for me to keep up with that performance. Thus, I was looking to deliver that.\" Although there was not enough turn on the Chepauk pitch, discussing her bowling plans, Sneh stated that using her stock balls more often helped her.\n\nSneh gave credit to the South African batters for making the most out of the good Chepauk batting surface but expressed her confidence in getting the job done on Sunday.\n\n\"The opponent batters are also out there to bat, and the pitch was helping them. They have played really beautifully, especially how they have taken control of the innings,\" she concluded.\n\nIndian off-spinners bowled exceptionally well: Sune Luus =================================================================== Meanwhile, South African all-rounder Sune Luus was all praise for the Indian off-spinners for having bowled beautifully, which included Rana and Deepti Sharma (1-41).\n\n\"The two (Indian) off-spinners bowled exceptionally well today. They were hitting the spots, and we didn't know whether to go back or forward or stay put,\" she realised.\n\nWhen asked about her 93-run partnership with Kapp and the discussions, Sune conceded that she had complete faith in the latter's ability and current form.\n\n\"But, Kapp and I discussed that we just need to build a partnership. Our best chance was to stay out there as long as we could.\n\n\"Kapp has quite some experience in Tests and has a lot of runs under her belt. I had full confidence in her. But also, we needed to be patient as no bowler would keep hitting the spot every single time,\" she added.

On the back of her spell, India bowled the Proteas out for 266 in 84.3 overs at the Chepauk.\n\nThe pressure was immensely on South Africa after India piled up a mammoth score of 603 for 6 (declared) in the first innings. Smriti Mandhana laid the platform with a knock of 149, after which Shafali Verma's 205 injected momentum into the innings. Jemimah Rodrigues, Harmanpreet Kaur and Richa Ghosh also scored brisk half-centuries. Ghosh fell agonisingly short of a Test century after Nonkululeko Mlaba dismissed her on 86.\n\nAfter the batters made hay, it was Rana's turn to shine. The spinner made early inroads by getting the wickets of Laura Wolvaardt and Anneke Bosch. Thereafter, he churned out the prized wicket of Marizanne Kapp, who made 74 runs.

As she walks into the press conference room after a gruelling day under the hot Chennai late-summer sun, she requests in jest, \"Please aaj questions chota rakna\" (Please keep the questions short today). But questions to Sneh, during media obligations and on the field, have never been short and she's learnt to deal with life and cricket's probing tendencies with wisdom and an endearing smile.\n\nOn Saturday, she was the pick of the bowlers, taking three of the four South African wickets to fall in the one-off Test at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.\n\nHer first spell got underway right before lunch, with skipper Harmanpreet predictably allowing her to get a feel of the new ball. She struck right after the start of the second session, rattling skipper Laura Wolvaardt with fuller balls in the stump line, threatening the pads. Wolvaardt survived one LBW appeal but finally succumbed to Sneh's wiles at the end of the over, unable to read a ball that stayed low and into the stumps and copped it on her pads.\n\nAnneke Bosch then took matters into her own hands when she held forte for 73 balls. She audaciously went for the boundary opportunities too. Sneh did everything she could with her variations and line to draw out a false shot or an edge to the attacking fields skipper Harmanpreet Kaur made available for her. She even bore being smacked over the ropes.\n\nIn the 31st over, she took the attack to Bosch, striking her on the arm with a ball turning in. Bosch fell off the very next ball to a similar back-of-the-length delivery. Bosch expected the ball to turn but it straightened, taking a thick edge and going straight to an alert Deepti Sharma in first slip.\n\nShe then sent back Delmi Tucker without allowing her to add to the score, drawing a shot out of the South African which swiftly went to Richa Ghosh behind the stumps. There were a few chances put down (like that of Nadine de Klerk in the dying minutes of the game or Sune Luus in the second session) which if taken would have handed Sneh a milestone at a venue which embraces spinner triumphs with open arms.\n\n\"I'd say Laura's wicket was more satisfactory...\" Sneh revealed after the day's play. \"...because I had manifested it for a long time. Finally getting that wicket was more satisfying for me.\"\n\nAll the spin love aside, Chennai's red soil strip, despite visible cracking, offered little assistance to the spinners for most of the day. Deepti and Sneh managed to make the ball turn more so due to their exaggerated efforts to get some revs on the ball. Barring some fluctuating bounce in small phases, the track had no real demons in it to rattle the Proteas.\n\nMuch like Deepti, the vastly experienced Sneh had her plans in place.\n\n\"The challenge really was that there wasn't a lot of turn early on. As a spinner, you had to use your fingers a lot in that phase. We had to use a harder grip. But as the wicket wore out, we got to see more bounce on the wicket and there was more turn later on,\" Sneh shrugged.\n\nThe 30-year-old's imperious showing was a tale of two halves. Her control and manufactured turn made the Proteas cautious. However, as the ball got harder to work through and fields with more open spaces were handed to her, the Proteas started finding ways to get to the ropes. She finished the day having bowled the most overs for India with an enviable economy rate of 3.05, second only to Deepti (among those who bowled at least 10 overs or more).\n\n\"We'd watched the videos of their main batters, the top five, and planned accordingly. We were all focused on our stock ball,\" she said.\n\nAmol Muzumdar's red ball acumen came through in the field settings Harmanpreet dished out for the batters early on. At one point, Shafali Verma was stationed at short mid-on, right between the non-striker and the stumps, to prevent the runs coming down the ground. Shubha Satheesh was a forward short-leg staple while Harmanpreet kept giving her spinners circular protection.\n\n\"Fielding is such an aspect in Test cricket where you can actually dominate the opposition, with your fielding positions,\" Sneh said, commending the role of aggressive fields in providing reprieves on a mildly frustrating day.\n\nDAY 2 REPORT | IND-W vs SA-W, One-off Test: Luus, Kapp help South Africa gain ground in against India\n\nSneh returns to the national side after six months, having last featured in an ODI against Australia. However, her Test credentials - evidenced by performances against England in 2021 (four wickets for 131 runs and a match-saving unbeaten 80) and 2023 (a match haul of 7/119) - make her a sure starter in this format.\n\nSneh is a thinking spinner who gives the captain the luxury of a bowler who can independently strategise proactively rather than simply follow laid-out blueprints. However, in the white ball formats, spinners like Shreyanka Patil, Asha Sobhana Joy have seen her drop down the pecking order. However, come Tests and Sneh is hard to look past. While that irreplaceability is a testament to her skillset and smarts, the typecasting as a Test player can often frustrate.\n\n\"Confidence toh humesha hi rehta hai,\" she said as she tried to explain how she kept herself motivated through the quiet spells between games.\n\n\"I've tried to continue from where I left off (against Australia) and tried to play with the same focus. More than magic, it took hard work here. After performing well against Australia which is one of the best teams in the world right now, the challenge is for you to deliver the same over and over again. That's all I had going through my mind today,\" she added.\n\nThe Indian administration's continued favour of red ball cricket has helped her stay in the zone.\n\n\"Even the multi-day InterZonal that was brought back by the BCCI after the Women's Premier League, was also quite encouraging. A player has to find a way to stay motivated.

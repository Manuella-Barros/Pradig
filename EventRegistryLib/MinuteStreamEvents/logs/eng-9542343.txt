The Mariners started their season 6-10, while the Twins stumbled to a 7-13 mark. These teams needed to make quick course corrections in order to give themselves a better-than-even chance of making the playoffs. They both responded in the latter half of April and have stabilized their seasons.\n\nThe Mariners have the best one-through-five starting pitching staff in Major League Baseball. Luis Castillo and Logan Gilbert get most of the attention, but their other starters have held up well and have contributed to a relentlessly consistent group which gives this team a chance to win nearly every night. The Mariners have their share of offensive weaknesses, but their starting pitching is so good that the margin for error is larger than it is for other teams with relatively limited offenses. Seattle has won 13 of its last 18 games and owns a slight lead over the defending World Series champion Texas Rangers in the American League West. With the Houston Astros a shocking 12-22 through 34 games, the Mariners' playoff odds have skyrocketed over the past three weeks.\n\nThe Twins have been the biggest story in baseball over the past two weeks. Their 12-game winning streak was the talk of the sport. It finally came to an end on Sunday against the Boston Red Sox. The American League Central was the weakest division in baseball last year. Through the first weekend of May, four A.L. Central teams are above .500. We're all waiting to see if this division can remain surprisingly tough and balanced. The Twins are part of that story.\n\nTV: Root SportsNet Northwest (Mariners) / Bally Sports North (Twins) / MLB Extra Innings\n\nThe Mariners are sending staff ace Luis Castillo to the mound. The Mariners' starting staff isn't heavily reliant on Castillo since everyone is producing, but Castillo is the veteran presence who, as the season moves along, should be able to pace himself and make adjustments better than the younger starters in the rotation.\n\nThe Twins' 12-game winning streak was undeniably impressive. It's hard to win that many games in a row regardless of opponent. Yet, it has to be acknowledged that six of those 12 wins came against the lowly Chicago White Sox. Against better competition -- and the Mariners qualify as such -- the Twins are due for some regression.\n\nWhy The Twins Could Cover The Spread\n\nThe Twins finally played a bad game against the Red Sox on Sunday as their 12-game winning streak ended. You knew the streak was going to end at some point. It was inevitable that Minnesota was going to lose. If you were a bettor who didn't want to pick the Twins precisely because you knew the streak was going to end, you now don't have to refrain from picking the Twins for that reason. The pressure to maintain the streak is gone. Media scrutiny will be less intense. This team can now hit the reset button and play well again.\n\nFinal Mariners-Twins Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Mariners' pitching is reliable, and the Twins' big winning streak was indeed built on a lot of wins against the White Sox. Seattle seems to be the better team here.

The defeat snapped the team's longest winning streak since 1991, when Minnesota rattled off 15 straight victories.\n\nTwins shortstop Carlos Correa said he and his teammates still feel good entering their series against Seattle -- even if Sunday's game did not turn out how they had hoped.\n\n\"It was special,\" Correa said of the winning streak. \"Gives us a lot of confidence moving forward. It's going to be a long season. We knew it wasn't going to last forever.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Seattle is looking to build upon a successful weekend series in which it won two of three games on the road against Houston. The Mariners are coming off a 5-4 win over the Astros on Sunday that featured a tiebreaking solo home run by Cal Raleigh during the top of the ninth inning.\n\nRaleigh's blast secured the sixth series win in a row for the Mariners.\n\n\"We're pitching awesome,\" Seattle manager Scott Servais said. \"I've talked about that for the last month or so. Our defense has really picked up. ... We're still not clicking offensively, but we're starting to make some strides.\"\n\nMariners right-hander Luis Castillo (3-4, 3.46 ERA) is set to make his eighth start of the season. He is looking to maintain a red-hot stretch in which he has gone 3-0 with a 0.90 ERA in his past three starts. During that time, he has allowed two runs on nine hits in 20 innings.\n\nCastillo has faced the Twins five times (all starts) in his career. He is 1-1 with a 5.63 ERA in those contests, but he posted a 3.46 ERA in two starts against Minnesota in 2023.\n\nThe Twins will counter with right-hander Simeon Woods Richardson (1-0, 2.45). Woods Richardson is looking to bounce back from an up-and-down performance in his latest start, during which he gave up two runs (one earned) on seven hits in 3 2/3 innings last Tuesday against the Chicago White Sox. He did not factor into the decision.\n\nWoods Richardson, 23, has never faced the Mariners in his brief career.\n\nTwins manager Rocco Baldelli said he felt proud of his team as it turned its attention to the Mariners. Minnesota lost 13 of its first 20 games before winning 12 of its past 13.\n\n\"The way we've come back from the start, which wasn't a great start, the way we came back from that shows character,\" Baldelli said. \"That's something you're really looking for in your group.\"\n\nThis is the first series of the season between the Twins and Mariners. The teams played seven times last season, with Seattle posting a 4-3 series edge despite being narrowly outscored 40-38 in those games.\n\nMinnesota is 8-7 at home this season. Seattle owns an identical 8-7 record on the road.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "centredaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Centre Daily Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@centredaily.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(pitcher,_born_1992)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (pitcher, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Raleigh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cal Raleigh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Servais", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Servais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Baldelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocco Baldelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/6sv43g/picture288337480/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/35893f20-2b95-4b1d-8fed-bbf9b25a13bb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542343", "eventUri": "eng-9542343", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Correa followed with another double to drive in Kepler.\n\nMinnesota held on to a one-run lead until the top of the seventh, when Seattle scored to even the score at 1-1. Jorge Polanco led off the inning with a single, advanced to third on a single by Mitch Haniger and scored on Garver's sacrifice fly to center.\n\nThe Twins scored two runs in the bottom of the seventh to grab a 3-1 advantage.\n\nVazquez drove in the first run of the inning with a sacrifice fly to center. That marked the final pitch for Castillo, who was replaced by right-handed reliever Trent Thornton.\n\nMoments later, Margot ripped a run-scoring single to center to drive in Willi Castro.\n\nPolanco finished 1-for-4 with a run in his first game at Target Field since the Twins traded him to the Mariners during the offseason. Minnesota fans gave a big ovation to Polanco, who spent his first 10 seasons with the Twins.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "thestate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The State"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@thestate.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_Jax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Griffin Jax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(pitcher,_born_1992)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (pitcher, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_V\u00e1zquez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian V\u00e1zquez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Margot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Margot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Garver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Garver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kepler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Kepler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Thielbar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Thielbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Thornton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Thornton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Polanco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Polanco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Haniger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Haniger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/5hrt7b/picture288369950/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/d343fb7c-1d67-41c9-b8c0-1768ece59e6f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542343", "eventUri": "eng-9542343", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

He whiffed five of his first six batters and had seven strikeouts through three innings, outpitching Mariners All-Star Luis Castillo. The only hit Woods Richardson permitted was a leadoff single by Mitch Garver in the third.\n\n\"He's been pitching really well. Today, he was phenomenal,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"It's just a pretty incredible start, and he's matching up against one of the best pitchers in the game. That can affect people sometimes, when you're watching the other guy on the other side of the field who does it all a lot and is putting up zeros, too. It didn't put him off one bit.\"\n\nSeattle loaded the bases with nobody out in the seventh but pushed across only one run against reliever Griffin Jax (3-2). Garver's sacrifice fly plated Jorge Polanco to tie it 1-all before Luke Raley struck out to end the inning.\n\nCastillo (3-5) allowed three runs in 6 2/3 innings and struck out seven. The right-hander, who won his previous three starts, didn't give up a hit until the fifth.\n\n\"He has a great name in this league. He's a competitor, throws strikes, gives his team the best chance to win,\" Woods Richardson said. \"So, it's always fun to go toe-to-toe with somebody like that.\"\n\nMinnesota's offense put together two runs in the seventh to reclaim the lead for good. Carlos Correa's second double of the game helped set up the go-ahead run, as he eventually came around to score on Christian V\u00e1zquez's sacrifice fly off Castillo for a 2-1 lead. Manuel Margot added an RBI single to make it 3-1.\n\n\"He's a top-of-the-rotation starter and he had all his pitches working today,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said of Castillo. \"They were just able to put a rally together against him late in the ballgame and it was one of those games where it was going to come down to that, who gets a big hit, who can put it together, and Correa had two big hits tonight, no question about that.\"\n\nTwins closer Jhoan Duran pitched the eighth, striking out Julio Rodr\u00edguez on three pitches to end the inning. Caleb Thielbar tossed a scoreless ninth for his third save.\n\nPOLANCO RETURNS\n\nAfter spending 10 years with the Twins, Polanco made his first trip to Target Field as a visitor.\n\nPolanco debuted with the Twins in 2014 and was traded to Seattle after the 2024 season. He was an All-Star in 2019 and helped Minnesota end its playoff drought last season.\n\n\"A lot of emotions,\" Polanco said pregame. \"I spent a lot of time here. It's definitely great coming back here, so I feel pretty good.\"\n\nThe Twins played Polanco's old walk-up music as he received a standing ovation before his first at-bat.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP Emerson Hancock (3-3, 4.75 ERA) takes the mound for Seattle in the second game of the series Tuesday. He gave up five runs in a loss to Atlanta last time out. Minnesota counters with RHP Bailey Ober (3-1, 4.55), who has won his last three starts for the Twins.\n\nThis story has been corrected to indicate that all three runs Castillo allowed were earned.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He filled in for Carlos Correa at shortstop during a brief injury stint, and he's currently taken over at center field for Byron Buxton, who's currently on the injured list due to right knee inflammation.\n\nEven better for the Twins, his bat has been hot, too, and it certainly was Wednesday night. Castro hit a 432-foot solo homer to right-center field in the second inning to give the Twins a 3-0 lead, and he hit an RBI triple in the fourth to make it a 4-1 Twins advantage.\n\nThe Twins got to Kirby right away in the first inning when Correa and Trevor Larnach hit back-to-back solo homers to give Minnesota a 2-0 lead.\n\nFormer Twin Mitch Garver pushed the first run across for the Mariners (20-17) when he hit a solo homer off Twins starter Chris Paddack during the fourth inning. That was the only run Paddack would give up in his 5 1/3 innings. He allowed eight hits in all while fanning 10.\n\nCaleb Thielbar came on in relief in the sixth inning, getting the final two outs before coming back out for the seventh.\n\nHis day ended after giving up a single to Julio Rodriguez, and the Mariners would later cut their deficit to one when Cal Raleigh hit a two-RBI double off Twins reliever Griffin Jax.\n\nRyan Jeffers hit an eighth-inning double down the third-base line off Mariners reliever Cody Bolton that scored Edouard Julien, who singled earlier in the frame.

He whiffed five of his first six batters and had seven strikeouts through three innings, outpitching Mariners All-Star Luis Castillo. The only hit Woods Richardson permitted was a leadoff single by Mitch Garver in the third.\n\n\"He's been pitching really well.

Garver's sacrifice fly plated Jorge Polanco to tie it 1-all before Luke Raley struck out to end the inning.\n\nCastillo (3-5) allowed three runs in 6 2/3 innings and struck out seven. The right-hander, who won his previous three starts, didn't give up a hit until the fifth.\n\n\"He has a great name in this league.

Carlos Correa's second double of the game helped set up the go-ahead run, as he eventually came around to score on Christian V\u00e1zquez's sacrifice fly off Castillo for a 2-1 lead. Manuel Margot added an RBI single to make it 3-1.\n\n\"He's a top-of-the-rotation starter and he had all his pitches working today,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said of Castillo. \"They were just able to put a rally together against him late in the ballgame and it was one of those games where it was going to come down to that, who gets a big hit, who can put it together, and Correa had two big hits tonight, no question about that.\"\n\nTwins closer Jhoan Duran pitched the eighth, striking out Julio Rodr\u00edguez on three pitches to end the inning.

V\u00e1zquez, however, rewarded the faith with a go-ahead sacrifice fly to center field.\n\nManuel Margot, the next batter, delivered an RBI ground ball single up the middle and the Twins squeaked past Seattle for a 3-1 victory at Target Field in a pitcher's duel where the two teams combined for seven hits. The Twins, who had their 12-game winning streak snapped Sunday, have won 13 of their last 14 games.\n\nThe seventh-inning rally savored a special start from Simeon Woods Richardson, who struck out a career-high eight batters in six shutout innings. Woods Richardson earned a spot in the Twins rotation after a couple of strong starts this season, but he never looked like he did Monday.\n\nHe struck out his first four batters and reached a career high in strikeouts by the third inning. He no longer carries a reputation for huge strikeout totals, particularly in the last two years, but he overwhelmed the Mariners in his sixth career start.\n\nWoods Richardson, one of the youngest starters in the majors at 23, allowed one hit and one walk in six innings. His eight strikeouts were his highest total in a start since he struck out eight Iowa Cubs in a Class AAA game on Aug. 27, 2022.\n\nHis best swing-and-miss pitch this season has been his slider. He didn't begin throwing it until the third inning, recording his first five strikeouts with fastballs. He worked on lowering his arm slot in the offseason to gain a little more velocity, and it paid off.\n\nGriffin Jax replaced Woods Richardson with a one-run lead in the seventh inning, and he immediately pitched himself into a bases-loaded jam after yielding two singles and a seven-pitch walk. It resulted in only one run during a 31-pitch inning. Mitch Garver drove in Jorge Polanco with a sacrifice fly to center, but Jax struck out two with the bases loaded.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe Twins didn't have a baserunner against Mariners ace Luis Castillo until Max Kepler reached on a two-base error to begin the fifth inning, a ground ball that bounced past first baseman Ty France along the first-base line. Carlos Correa, the next batter, hammered a belt-high 96-mph fastball off the center field wall for an RBI double.\n\nOne hit, one unearned run and the Twins knew it wouldn't be any easier to create offense.\n\nSeattle's pitchers entered Monday with a 1.74 ERA over their last 22 games. After completing a three-game series against the Boston Red Sox, Twins Manager Rocco Baldelli said seven straight games of \"some of the best pitching you're going to see all year long.\"\n\nThe Twins started their seventh-inning rally when Kepler drew a five-pitch walk and Correa followed with a double to left field. After an out at the plate -- Kepler was caught in a rundown when Willi Castro grounded to the first baseman -- the bottom two hitters in the Twins lineup delivered key runs.\n\nCastillo did everything he could to match Woods Richardson. He threw a first-pitch strike to his first 13 batters. He permitted two hits, both to Correa, and three walks in 6 2/3 innings with seven strikeouts.\n\n\u00a92024 StarTribune.

The early story for Woods Richardson was how much the Mariners struggled to make any kind of contact at all against him; he struck out five of the first six batters he faced and seven of the first ten. The single to Garver was the only hit allowed by the Twins' starter.\n\nMariners starter Luis Castillo had a perfect game going through four innings that was broken up by an error from first baseman Ty France, allowing Max Kepler to reach. The no-hitter was gone immediately afterward, with Correa driving a 2-2 pitch into the left field corner for the Twins' first hit, scoring Kepler from first and giving the Twins a 1-0 lead.\n\nWoods Richardson set the Mariners down 1-2-3 in the top of the sixth but was still removed in the seventh with the Twins nursing a 1-0 lead. Woods Richardson had thrown 84 pitches with the Mariners' 3-4-5 batters coming up, so Rocco Baldelli's move to put Griffin Jax in the game was certainly defensible, but unfortunately, Jax blew the lead in short order.\n\nJax gave up a leadoff hit to Old Friend Jorge Polanco and a single to Mitch Haniger, sending Polanco to third. Jax walked Cam Raleigh to load the bases before striking out Ty France. He gave up a medium-deep drive to Garver, however, which allowed Polanco to score from third to tie the game. Old Friend (kind of) Luke Raley struck out to end the threat.\n\nThe Twins answered right back. Kepler walked, and Correa once again doubled into left, although this time Kepler had to stop at third base. Willi Castro hit a bouncer to France at first, and Kepler froze off of third base. Thankfully, he stayed in a rundown long enough for Correa to advance to third and Castro to get all the way to second base.\n\nThe Mariners intentionally walked Carlos Santana in order to get to the righty Vazquez, but the veteran catcher came through with a sacrifice fly to deep right-center to put the Twins back in the lead. Seattle took out Castillo, and Manuel Margot (finally) came through, poking a single up the middle to give the Twins an insurance run, expanding the lead to 3-1.\n\nBaldelli brought in Duran to face the 9-1-2 batters in the Mariners lineup in the eighth, and he mowed them down: strikeout, groundout, strikeout. That left Caleb Thielbar to face Polanco, Haniger, and Raleigh -- and he delivered. Despite struggling so far after returning from the injured list, he coaxed a flyout from Polanco and struck out both Haniger and Raleigh to earn the save.\n\nHuge for the Twins to grab a win right after their 12-game winning streak was ended in resounding fashion on Sunday. We'll see if they can score enough against the Mariners to win the series.", "source": {"uri": "twinkietown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twinkie Town"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He struck out five of the first six batters he faced and had seven strikeouts through three innings. The only hit he permitted was a leadoff single by Mitch Garver in the third.\n\nSeattle loaded the bases with nobody out in the seventh but pushed across only one run against reliever Griffin Jax (3-2). Garver\u00b4s sacrifice fly plated Jorge Polanco to tie it 1-all before Luke Raley struck out to end the threat.\n\nSeattle starter Luis Castillo (3-5) went 6 2/3 innings and struck out seven. He allowed three runs - two earned.\n\nMinnesota's offense put together two runs in the seventh to reclaim the lead for good. Carlos Correa's second double of the game helped set up the go-ahead run, as he eventually came around to score on Christian V\u00e1zquez's sacrifice fly off Castillo for a 2-1 lead. Manuel Margot added an RBI single to make it 3-1.\n\nMinnesota Twins starting pitcher Simeon Woods Richardson delivers during the fourth inning of a baseball game against the Seattle Mariners, Monday, May 6, 2024, in Minneapolis.

Caleb Thielbar tossed a scoreless ninth for his third save.\n\nPOLANCO RETURNS\n\nAfter spending 10 years with the Twins, Polanco made his first trip to Target Field as a visitor.\n\nPolanco debuted with the Twins in 2014 and was traded to Seattle after the 2024 season. He was an All-Star in 2019 and helped Minnesota end its playoff drought last season.\n\n\"A lot of emotions,\" Polanco said pregame. \"I spent a lot of time here. It\u00b4s definitely great coming back here, so I feel pretty good.\"\n\nThe Twins played Polanco's old walk-up music as he received a standing ovation before his first at-bat.\n\nRHP Emerson Hancock (3-3, 4.75 ERA) takes the mound for Seattle in the second game of the series Tuesday. He gave up five runs in a loss to Atlanta last time out.

Turns out, that wasn't a problem.\n\nThe Twins beat up on Mariners starter Logan Gilbert in an 11-1 victory Thursday afternoon at Target Field in Minneapolis in front of an announced crowd of 22,154. The Twins took three of the four games against the Mariners despite facing top-tier pitching throughout the series.\n\nGilbert entered Thursday's game with a 1.69 earned-run averaged and hadn't given up more than four runs and five hits in seven previous starts this season.\n\nThe Twins (22-15) reset those highs to nine hits and eight runs, and they chased Gilbert after four innings, making it his shortest start of the season, too.\n\nMinnesota plated five runs in the first inning, getting three straight singles from Trevor Larnach, Max Kepler and Jose Miranda. Kepler's single marked the 11th straight game he's recorded a hit, the longest hitting streak of his career. It also plated the first run of the game, scoring Edouard Julien, who had led off the inning by drawing a walk.\n\nLater in the inning with two outs and the bases loaded, Manny Margot hit a three-RBI double to left field that scored Larnach, Miranda and Kepler. Carlos Santana brought Margot home with an RBI single to center field to give the Twins an early and commanding 5-0 lead.\n\nMargot went 1 for 4 with five RBIs.\n\nMeanwhile, Pablo Lopez pitched 6 1/3 innings of one-run ball for the Twins, allowing just four hits while fanning 10. It's the second straight day a Twins starter finished with double-digit strikeouts as Chris Paddack fanned 10 in a 6-3 victory over the Mariners Wednesday night.\n\nLopez picked up his fourth win of the season.\n\nMitch Haniger led off the second inning with a double and was brought home when Luke Raley singled to right field a couple at-bats later to score the first run for the Mariners (20-18), but Ryan Jeffers got it right back by hitting a solo homer off Gilbert in the bottom of the frame.\n\nThat was also the only run the Mariners would push across in Thursday's series finale.\n\nThe Twins plated another pair of runs in the fourth when Julien hit an RBI single that scored Santana, who led off the inning with a single, and Jeffers hit a sacrifice fly to left field to score Austin Martin, who was walked earlier in the inning. In the fifth inning, the Twins added another run when Miranda doubled and was brought home by Margot, who grounded out to short.\n\nThe Twins continued to pile on runs in the seventh inning off Mariners reliever Tyson Miller. Kepler led off the frame with a 411-foot solo homer to right-center field, Miranda reached on an error and later scored when Margot hit a grounder to third baseman Luis Urias, but his throw to first was off the mark allowing Margot to reach and take second base. Those runs gave the Twins an 11-1 lead.\n\nJosh Staumont made his first appearance since getting called up on Wednesday, getting the chance to pitch the ninth inning with a 10-run advantage. Staumont walked former Twin Mitch Garver before striking out another former Twin in Jorge Polanco. Staumont then struck out Raley before allowing a single to Urias, but he struck out Leo Rivas to close it out without allowing any damage.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But Kepler got into a rundown, allowing Correa to move to third and Castro to second before Kepler was tagged out.\n\nCastillo then intentionally walked lefty Carlos Santana to get to right-hander Christian Vazquez, who hit a long sacrifice fly to the warning track in right-center to score Correa and make it 2-1.\n\nThat was it for Castillo, who made way for right-hander Trent Thornton.

Ryan Jeffers and Max Kepler each homered and drove in two runs, Jose Miranda scored three runs on two hits and Margot matched his career high with five RBIs for the Twins (22-15), who won for the 15th time in their last 17 games.\n\nThis matchup of premier American League starting pitchers didn't materialize at all. Gilbert (3-1) ominously issued a leadoff walk and hit his previous season high of five hits allowed in just eight batters.\n\nThe Twins got the bounces, like when Miranda checked his swing in the first inning and accidentally hit a slow-bouncing single up the third base line. But there were plenty of hard-hit balls, like the 104 mph drive Jeffers sent into the flower boxes above the wall in left-center field.\n\nGilbert failed to pitch into the sixth for the first time in eight starts this season. The 2018 first-round draft pick gave up eight runs, the most since he was a rookie in 2021, on nine hits and two walks while finishing five innings. The AL-leading ERA of 1.69 he took into the game rocketed up to 2.94.\n\nL\u00f3pez gave up one run on four hits without a walk in 6 1/3 innings.\n\nMinnesota Twins' Manuel Margot hits a double driving in three runs against Seattle Mariners Logan Gilbert during the first inning of a baseball game, Thursday, May 9, 2024, in Minneapolis.

Kepler set his career high by stretching his hitting streak to 11 games and is batting .434 (23 for 53) with three homers and 14 RBIs in 16 games since coming off the injured list. Jeffers, who entered the game ranked third in the AL in OPS, went deep for the eighth time this season.\n\nTwins SS Carlos Correa was given a rest day after playing in nine straight games following his reinstatement from the injured list.\n\nThe Mariners were waiting to announce their starter for Friday night, when they host Oakland to commence a three-game series. The A's will send RHP Paul Blackburn (3-1, 3.00 ERA) to the mound.\n\nTwins RHP Joe Ryan (1-2, 3.54 ERA) pitches on Friday night in the opener of a three-game series at Toronto.

He allowed a solo homer to Mitch Garver, the only run against him. Paddack, who got 19 swings and misses, has allowed two or fewer runs in five of seven starts.\n\nThe Twins let Paddack throw a season-high 99 pitches, before Caleb Thielbar entered for the last two outs in the sixth.\n\nCal Raleigh, whose pinch hit grand slam sparked the rally for a 10-6 victory on Tuesday, drove a two-out, two-run double off the wall in right-center off Griffin Jax to pull the Mariners within one in the seventh.\n\nMinnesota's bullpen remains in flux with key setup men Brock Stewart and Justin Topa on the injured list, but Jax was able to pitch a perfect eighth to bridge the gap to Jhoan Duran for his third save in a perfect ninth inning.\n\nRyan Jeffers and Max Kepler hit RBI doubles in the eighth to pad the lead for Duran.\n\nKirby (3-3), meanwhile, surrendered three-plus homers for just the third time in 64 career starts.

He struck out five of the first six batters he faced and had seven strikeouts through three innings. The only hit he permitted was a leadoff single by Mitch Garver in the third.\n\nSeattle loaded the bases with nobody out in the seventh but pushed across only one run against reliever Griffin Jax (3-2). Garver's sacrifice fly plated Jorge Polanco to tie it 1-all before Luke Raley struck out to end the threat.\n\nSeattle starter Luis Castillo (3-5) went 6 2/3 innings and struck out seven. He allowed three runs -- two earned.\n\nMinnesota's offense put together two runs in the seventh to reclaim the lead for good. Carlos Correa's second double of the game helped set up the go-ahead run, as he eventually came around to score on Christian V\u00e1zquez's sacrifice fly off Castillo for a 2-1 lead. Manuel Margot added an RBI single to make it 3-1.\n\nTwins closer Jhoan Duran pitched the eighth, striking out Julio Rodr\u00edguez on three pitches to end the inning. Caleb Thielbar tossed a scoreless ninth for his third save.\n\nPOLANCO RETURNS\n\nAfter spending 10 years with the Twins, Polanco made his first trip to Target Field as a visitor.\n\nPolanco debuted with the Twins in 2014 and was traded to Seattle after the 2024 season. He was an All-Star in 2019 and helped Minnesota end its playoff drought last season.\n\n\"A lot of emotions,\" Polanco said pregame. \"I spent a lot of time here.

He allowed a solo homer to Mitch Garver, the only run against him.

The bid for perfection or even a shutout ended early in the fifth inning. Max Kepler led off the inning with a ground ball down the first-base line that appeared to hit off the first-base bag slightly and then misplayed by Ty France for a two-base error. With Kepler on second, Carlos Correa hit a deep fly ball off the wall in right field to drive in the first run of the game.\n\nTwins starter Simeon Woods Richardson delivered one of the best outings of his career. In the fifth start of his MLB career -- four of them coming this season -- the 23-year-old right-hander pitched six scoreless innings, allowing just one hit with a walk and career-high eight strikeouts.\n\nUnlike other opposing pitchers that befuddle Seattle's swing-happy hitters with breaking balls, Woods Richardson challenged them with fastballs -- and beat them.\n\nOf his 82 pitches, he threw 33 four-seam fastballs, getting 17 strikes and only three balls in play.\n\nHe struck out six of the first eight hitters he faced.\n\nKnowing that a third time through the heart of the Mariners order would be a difficult task, the Twins turned to right-handed reliever Griffin Jax, who had been dominant this season.\n\nBut Jax struggled to locate his pitches, particularly when he was ahead in the count. Jorge Polanco and Mitch Haniger worked full counts and came up with singles to start the seventh inning. Cal Raleigh worked a walk to load the bases with no outs.\n\nBut Seattle would manage just one run. Ty France struck out swinging, Mitch Garver hit a sac fly to center to score Polanco and Luke Raley struck out.\n\nOne run was better than none and likely exceeded the expectation of a fan base that is fatigue by the Mariners' inconsistent offense.\n\nBut the Twins answered immediately in the bottom of the inning. With the bases loaded and one out, Christian Vazquez hit a sac fly to deep center to give Minnesota a 2-1 lead.\n\nServais called on Trent Thornton to get the third out, but he allowed an RBI single to Manuel Margot for a big insurance run.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_divish@seattletimes.com", "name": "Ryan

At 19-15, they're on a 91-win pace for the season, which, in their division, could be enough to finish on top for the first time since their 116-win season in 2001. It would also be just the fourth time the M's won the West since they came into the league in 1977.\n\nLast week started by taking two of three from the Atlanta Braves, and ended by taking two of three from the Houston Astros, who have been playing better baseball of late. The Mariners haven't been a flashy team just yet. They're not grabbing headlines for outright dominating clubs, but they are quietly taking down some tough competition.\n\nSeattle started the season with a 23.6% chance to win the division, and right now those odds have more than doubled, up to 50.1%. It was always a decent possibility that they'd make a run in the West, but with the club having plenty of room to improve over the course of the season, it should be a little worrisome to the rest of the division.\n\nRelated: Seattle Mariners standing in Sportsnaut's MLB power rankings\n\nMariners starters just had a streak snapped where they had gone 21 straight games in which their starters had allowed two runs or fewer, which is tied for the second-longest streak in MLB history. That is an insane streak, and really speaks not only to the quality of the M's rotation, but also of the depth they have one through five. When you have starters allowing two or fewer runs, then you're going to collect a whole bunch of wins in the process.\n\nSeattle's rotation ranks third in ERA with a 3.11, trailing just the Boston Red Sox (2.10) and Philadelphia Phillies (2.65). That's the starting point for this club's success.\n\nThen, when you pair the rotation with the bullpen the team is throwing out there, that's when they become a team to be feared moving forward. Their relievers hold a cumulative 2.72 ERA behind the New York Yankees (2.27) and Cleveland Guardians (2.72). Overall, the Mariners rank second in ERA with a 2.98, slightly behind Boston's 2.61. The two clubs split a four-game series at the beginning of the season.\n\nThis is where the reinforcements will be coming from. Heading into play on Monday, the Mariners rank 26th in baseball in runs scored (124), which means there is plenty of room to climb to be even a middle-of-the-pack offense.\n\nWe also saw this a little bit last season. They began the year 17-17 in their first 34 games, so this year's 19 wins is a slight improvement. We also saw Julio Rodr\u00edguez go absolutely ballistic in August last year, going 45-for-105 (.429) with a .474 OBP, seven homers, and 30 RBI. Seattle was 55-51 at the beginning of that month, and ended up going 21-6 that month.\n\nThis isn't to say that we should expect a month like that from J-Rod every season, but it does illustrate that he can carry the team with the bat for an extended period. He has yet to really kick it into gear yet this season, collecting just one homer, striking out nearly 30% of the time, and holding a 90 wRC+ (100 is league average). He was roughly average in the first half last season too.\n\nThe rest of the offense is also off to slow starts, including J.P. Crawford (82 wRC+, 134 last season), Mitch Garver (74, 138), and Luke Raley (55, 130). As the face of the franchise, J-Rod is going to have a lot more eyeballs on him, but Garver was one of the team's only big additions this winter in free agency, and Raley was a trade acquisition from Tampa Bay. The front office made a lot of moves to shuffle the chairs around, and thus far those moves aren't paying off on offense.\n\nThat said, there are some talented veterans on this roster that you would hope will pick it up a bit as the weather continues to warm.\n\nRelated: MLB Playoff and World Series predictions\n\nAfter starting the year 7-13, the Minnesota Twins are one of the hottest teams in baseball. Winners of 12 of their last 13, the Twins and Mariners are both coming in after losing streaks. Seattle just lost their streak of 21 games where starters allowed two or fewer runs, and the Twins' loss on Sunday snapped their 12-game win streak.\n\nDuring their win streak, Minnesota had the best offense in baseball with a 157 wRC+, swatting 16 homers with 84 runs scored and 13 stolen bases. They've also ranked 10th in team ERA with a 3.08, while Seattle has ranked first in ERA over this stretch with a 1.86. This should be an interesting matchup.\n\nOn top of both teams playing good ball coming into this series, on the season, both clubs have a +13 run differential and nearly identical records with the Twins at 19-14 to Seattle's 19-15.\n\nNot only will this be a series for Seattle to test themselves against a good-hitting club on a hot streak, but this will also serve as a good test for Minnesota. While they had won 12 straight entering play on Sunday, seven of those games came against the worst team in the American League in the Chicago White Sox, and three came against the second-worst team in the Los Angeles Angels. The other two came against Boston.\n\nSo yes, the Seattle Mariners are having trouble scoring runs, but are the Twins for real? We'll get some insight when these two clubs clash for four games this week.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_burke@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Jason Burke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Rodr\u00edguez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julio Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Raley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Raley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

He recorded one out, striking out a batter after giving up a leadoff single, but the Twins bullpen needed every out they received from him.\n\nCaleb Thielbar, Griffin Jax and Jhoan Duran covered the last 11 outs as the Twins held off the Seattle Mariners for a 6-3 victory Wednesday night at Target Field. Jax, who made his first multi-inning appearance in two years, surrendered a two-run, two-out double to Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh in the seventh inning, but the Twins scored two insurance runs with two outs in the eighth.\n\n\"We needed a big effort from our starting pitcher and Paddack gave it to us,\" Baldelli said.\n\nPaddack left the mound to a standing ovation from fans behind the Twins dugout. He allowed one run -- an opposite-field homer to Mitch Garver -- in 5\u2153 innings. He matched a season-high 10 strikeouts and his 99 pitches were the most he has thrown in a game since 2021.\n\nWhen Baldelli came to the mound, Paddack said he thanked him for trusting him to pitch to a couple more batters. He knows the Twins will monitor his innings this year, his first full season after recovering from his second Tommy John surgery, and he won't often be successful lobbying to pitch deeper into games.\n\n\"I looked up there in the fourth inning and I was at [79] pitches,\" Paddack said. \"I was like I've got to find a way to get out to at least the sixth, especially with the bullpen kind of beat up, a couple guys down. The 10 punchies were nice, but I'm a guy that I want to get deep into games. That's how we win.\"\n\nBOXSCORE: Twins 6, Seattle 3\n\nThe Twins offense did its part against Mariners starter George Kirby, who finished eighth in last year's American League Cy Young voting. Kirby had allowed one run over his past 20 innings entering Wednesday, and the Twins had two runs after three batters.\n\nCarlos Correa and Trevor Larnach bashed back-to-back 400-foot homers in the first inning. Correa connected on a curveball that floated over the middle of the plate, and Larnach followed two pitches later with a second-deck homer to right-center field.\n\n\"Our offense has shown up,\" Baldelli said. \"You can't just pace your way through these games and think if you just have decent at-bats it'll work. You have to have an exceptional plan. ... You're not going to face better pitching.\"\n\nThe original Rally Sausage, which Baldelli suggested would be trashed after the Twins' 12-game winning streak ended, returned to the dugout Monday when the Twins were no-hit through four innings in the series opener.\n\nSign up for our Twins Update newsletter\n\nWilli Castro tapped the summer sausage when he saw it while warming up Wednesday. He hit a 432-foot homer and an RBI triple in his first two at-bats. After Castro carried the packaged sausage through the dugout following his homer, per team tradition, he sniffed his gloves when he set it down.\n\n\"I thought I smelled something, but no,\" Castro said. \"I know that it's going to open one day. That day is almost there.\"\n\nIn the eighth inning, with a one-run lead, Edouard Julien singled to snap an 0-for-14 slump.

Facing Logan Gilbert, the American League's ERA leader, the Twins blitzed him for five runs in the first inning Thursday.\n\nEight of the Twins' nine starters recorded a hit during an 11-1 rout at Target Field, taking three of the four games from a Mariners team that entered this week in first place in the American League West. The Twins, who posted a 5-2 record on their homestand against Seattle and Boston, have won 15 of their last 17 games.\n\nStaked to a big lead, Pablo L\u00f3pez was almost flawless during his 6\u2153 inning outing, permitting one run. The Mariners totaled six baserunners against him through four hits, a hit batsman and a catcher's interference.\n\nThe Twins generated nine hits and eight runs in four innings against Gilbert, who entered Thursday with a 1.69 ERA. This is the same Gilbert who surrendered 16 hits and four runs across his last five starts and 35\u2153 innings.\n\nFour of the first five Twins batters reached base in the first inning. Max Kepler opened the scoring with a line drive through the right side of the infield for an RBI single, extending his hitting streak to a career-high 11 games.\n\nWhen the Twins had Gilbert on the ropes, loading the bases with two outs, they didn't let up. Manuel Margot, who entered with a .164 batting average, pulled a splitter down the left-field line for a bases-clearing, three-run double. It was only the Twins' fourth hit with the bases loaded this season, and Carlos Santana followed with an RBI single up the middle.\n\nThe Twins sent all nine batters to the plate during their five-run first inning. In Gilbert's first seven starts this season, he allowed a combined one hit and zero runs during the first inning.\n\nLike the Twins offense did when they beat up the last-place Chicago White Sox and Los Angeles Angels at the start of their winning streak, the offense kept piling up hits. Ryan Jeffers lined a solo home run to left field in the second inning, his team-leading eighth homer of the season. Edouard Julien hit an RBI single in the fourth inning, a chopper that hopped over Gilbert and rolled between two diving middle infielders.\n\nThe Twins had six hits in their first 10 at-bats with a runner in scoring position. Margot drove in five runs, surpassing his season total from his first 31 games.\n\nKepler launched a down-the-middle fastball over the right-field wall for a solo homer in the seventh inning, marking his sixth straight game with an extra-base hit. Kepler returned from the injured list at the start of the Twins' winning streak, and he's posted a .434 batting average with 15 RBI in 16 games.\n\nEven Seattle's defense fell apart under the barrage of hits. Jose Miranda reached base in the seventh inning when right fielder Sam Haggerty dropped a fly ball and Miranda scored on a ground ball that third baseman Luis Ur\u00edas turned into a throwing error.\n\nMitch Haniger opened the Seattle second inning with a double, a fly ball that dropped when center fielder Austin Martin slid into Julien, the second baseman, in shallow center field. Haniger scored on a two-out single from Luke Raley.\n\nL\u00f3pez struck out a season-high 10 batters, his seventh career start with a double-digit strikeout total.", "source": {"uri":

He allowed a solo homer to Mitch Garver, the only run against him.\n\n\"That's just a freaking good outing, all the way around,\" manager Rocco Baldelli said.\n\nThe Twins let Paddack throw a season-high 99 pitches, the second-most of his career, before Caleb Thielbar entered for the last two outs in the sixth. Paddack made a point to shake Baldelli's hand and thank him for the trust.\n\n\"There's going to be very few opportunities that I get this year to be able to ask Rocco for more,\" Paddack said, \"and tonight was one of those.\"\n\nCastro, who has taken over as the regular center fielder with Byron Buxton out, took hold of the club's lucky summer sausage in the dugout after going deep. After putting the heavily wrapped meat on the shelf for the next homer, repeatedly smelled his batting gloves to make sure there was no rot.\n\n\"I know that's going to open one day,\" Castro said. \"It's almost there. That day is almost there.\"\n\nCal Raleigh, whose pinch hit grand slam sparked the rally for a 10-6 victory on Tuesday, drove a two-out, two-run double off the wall in right-center off Griffin Jax to pull the Mariners within one in the seventh.\n\nMinnesota's bullpen remains in flux with key setup men Brock Stewart and Justin Topa on the injured list. But Jax pitched a perfect eighth to bridge the gap to Jhoan Duran who got his third save with a perfect ninth inning after Ryan Jeffers and Max Kepler hit RBI doubles in the eighth to pad the lead.\n\nThe Mariners went 1 for 7 with three strikeouts with runners in scoring position.\n\n\"It's just really hard to get rallies going and sustain any momentum when we're not putting the ball in play,\" manager Scott Servais said.\n\nKirby (3-3), who had allowed only two home runs to date this season, surrendered three-plus homers for just the third time in 64 career starts.\n\n\"He really throws the fastball,\" Castro said. \"We were really aggressive with him.\"\n\nKirby gave up four runs in five innings, failing to add to Seattle's total of 22 quality starts that's tied for the major league lead with Philadelphia.\n\n\"There's nothing physically wrong with George. I know everybody's got all these ideas, whatever,\" Servais said. \"It's not coming out right now.\"\n\nKirby Snead, who was promoted from Triple-A Tacoma before the game, pitched a perfect sixth in becoming the 1,000th player to appear in a game in Mariners history.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP Logan Gilbert (3-0, 1.69 ERA) starts for the Mariners in the finale of the four-game series on Thursday afternoon.

Two teams with winning records are trying to make sure that after playing a few weeks of good baseball, they sustain what they have developed. The Mariners had an 18-game stretch in which they went 13-5 this season. The Twins recently won 12 games in a row. Now they have traded punches in a hard-fought series which promises more drama and interesting plot points.\n\nThe Mariners' 10-6 win on Tuesday in Minnesota was a wild ride. Seattle took a 2-0 lead. Then Minnesota went ahead 4-2. The Mariners responded with a Cal Raleigh pinch-hit grand slam for a 6-4 lead in the seventh. The Twins fought back and tied the game in the bottom of the eighth and had the go-ahead run on base, but they couldn't score him. The Mariners roared back in the top of the ninth for four runs and a 10-6 win in a seesaw battle.\n\nMonday belonged to the pitchers in Minnesota's 3-1 win. Tuesday belonged to the hitters in Seattle's triumph. Let's see what Wednesday brings in an American League season which has been filled with surprises through six weeks of action.\n\nTV: Root SportsNet Northwest (Mariners) / Bally Sports North (Twins) / MLB Extra Innings\n\nThe Mariners are blessed with elite pitching. The question is if they can hit. Tuesday night, they did, scoring eight runs in the final three innings and posting four runs in two separate innings. Seattle got extra-base hits in high-leverage situations. It's exactly what the organization is looking for. It's a final piece of the puzzle for this team. If it can get timely and loud hits against formidable opponents on the road, Seattle should find itself in the postseason given that its pitching staff is unlikely to falter. After Tuesday's thrilling win, the Mariners will come to the ballpark filled with confidence. They have to like their chances in this game, given that they won't suffer in virtually every matchup of starting pitchers they encounter this season.\n\nWhy The Twins Could Cover The Spread\n\nThe Twins did give up 10 to the Mariners on Tuesday, but they gave up only two runs through the first six innings. This was an aberrationally bad late-inning game from a Minnesota team which had been very strong in the late innings of games this season. A team which just did win 12 games in a row has had a few hiccups, but on a long-term basis, you're not going to see Minnesota allow tons of runs, and you're not going to see this team implode in the late innings of games. The laws of averages would suggest that Minnesota will contain Seattle's bats in this game and restore order with a win.\n\nFinal Mariners-Twins Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Mariners' pitching is a constant, but it wasn't all that reliable on Tuesday night. These teams feel like mysteries more than known entities at this point.

Ryan Jeffers and Max Kepler each homered and drove in two runs, Jose Miranda scored three runs on two hits and Margot matched his career high with five RBIs for the Twins (22-15), who won for the 15th time in their last 17 games.\n\n\"I don't know what more I could ask for from our offense and the way they did their jobs,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"I was sitting back for a period of time, just watching and being very impressed with the whole group.\"\n\nThis matchup of premier American League starting pitchers didn't materialize. Gilbert (3-1) ominously issued a four-pitch leadoff walk and hit his previous season high of five hits allowed in just eight batters.\n\nThe Twins got the bounces, like when Miranda checked his swing in the first inning and accidentally hit a slow-bouncing single up the third base line. But there were plenty of hard-hit balls, like the 104 mph drive Jeffers sent into the flower boxes above the wall in left-center field.\n\nGilbert failed to pitch into the sixth for the first time in eight starts this season. The 2018 first-round draft pick gave up eight runs, the most since he was a rookie in 2021, on nine hits and two walks while finishing five innings. The AL-leading ERA of 1.69 he took into the game rocketed up to 2.94.\n\n\"What I was doing today obviously wasn't working,\" Gilbert said.\n\nL\u00f3pez gave up one run on four hits without a walk in 6 1/3 innings, which included a slick catch by shortstop Willi Castro of a line drive that first glanced off the third baseman Miranda's glove.\n\nThe stars of the show were at the plate for the Twins, who have averaged 6.6 runs and 10.1 hits over this 17-game surge. Kepler set his career high with an 11-game hitting streak and is batting .434 with three homers and 14 RBIs in 16 games since coming off the injured list. Jeffers, who entered the game ranked third in the AL in OPS, went deep for the eighth time this season.\n\nThat Twins have hit their stride with Royce Lewis and Byron Buxton sidelined -- a testament to their depth.\n\n\"There's no way to have sustained success in this game if there's only a portion of the lineup that's producing,\" Baldelli said.\n\nThe Mariners struck out 53 times this week at Target Field, a Twins record for a four-game series. Cal Raleigh, who had a grand slam on Tuesday and a two-run double on Wednesday, whiffed in all three of his at-bats against L\u00f3pez.\n\nJulio Rodriguez, the 2022 AL Rookie of the Year and two-time All-Star, is batting .212 over his last 12 games with one extra-base hit and one RBI.\n\n\"There's only a couple guys that would tell you that they're really happy with how things have gone for them this year,\" right fielder Mitch Haniger said. \"We need to pick it up.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMariners RHP Bryan Woo will come off the injured list and start on Friday night, when they host Oakland to commence a three-game series. RHP Paul Blackburn (3-1, 3.00 ERA) pitches for the A's.\n\nTwins RHP Joe Ryan (1-2, 3.54 ERA) pitches on Friday night to open a three-game series at Toronto. LHP Yusei Kikuchi (2-2, 2.72 ERA) starts for the Blue Jays.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors":

The Mariners have not lost a series since April 14, winning at least two out of three in each of their last six series.

But Jax pitched a perfect eighth to bridge the gap to Jhoan Duran who got his third save with a perfect ninth inning after Ryan Jeffers and Max Kepler hit RBI doubles in the eighth to pad the lead.\n\nThe Mariners went 1 for 7 with three strikeouts with runners in scoring position.\n\n\"It's just really hard to get rallies going and sustain any momentum when we're not putting the ball in play,\" manager Scott Servais said.\n\nKirby (3-3), who had allowed only two home runs to date this season, surrendered three-plus homers for just the third time in 64 career starts.\n\n\"He really throws the fastball,\" Castro said. \"We were really aggressive with him.\"\n\nKirby gave up four runs in five innings, failing to add to Seattle's total of 22 quality starts that's tied for the major league lead with Philadelphia.\n\n\"There's nothing physically wrong with George. I know everybody's got all these ideas, whatever,\" Servais said. \"It's not coming out right now.\"\n\nKirby Snead, who was promoted from Triple-A Tacoma before the game, pitched a perfect sixth in becoming the 1,000th player to appear in a game in Mariners history.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMariners: RHP Tayler Saucedo, who hyperextended his right knee while covering first base on Tuesday, was placed on the 15-day injured list before the game.\n\nTwins: Topa, who was acquired from the Mariners in the trade for 2B Jorge Polanco to take a key late-inning role in the bullpen, aggravated the patellar tendinitis in his left knee in a rehab outing on Sunday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP Logan Gilbert (3-0, 1.69 ERA) starts for the Mariners in the finale of the four-game series on Thursday afternoon. RHP Pablo L\u00f3pez (3-2, 4.30 ERA) takes the mound for the Twins.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

V\u00e1zquez, however, rewarded the faith with a go-ahead sacrifice fly to center field.\n\nManuel Margot, the next batter, delivered an RBI ground ball single up the middle and the Twins squeaked past Seattle for a 3-1 victory at Target Field in a pitcher's duel where the two teams combined for seven hits. The Twins, who had their 12-game winning streak snapped Sunday, have won 13 of their last 14 games.\n\nThe seventh-inning rally savored a special start from Simeon Woods Richardson, who struck out a career-high eight batters in six shutout innings. Woods Richardson earned a spot in the Twins rotation after a couple of strong starts this season, but he never looked like he did Monday.\n\nHe struck out his first four batters and reached a career high in strikeouts by the third inning. He no longer carries a reputation for huge strikeout totals, particularly in the last two years, but he overwhelmed the Mariners in his sixth career start.\n\nWoods Richardson, one of the youngest starters in the majors at 23, allowed one hit and one walk in six innings. His eight strikeouts were his highest total in a start since he struck out eight Iowa Cubs in a Class AAA game on Aug. 27, 2022.\n\nHis best swing-and-miss pitch this season has been his slider. He didn't begin throwing it until the third inning, recording his first five strikeouts with fastballs. He worked on lowering his arm slot in the offseason to gain a little more velocity, and it paid off.\n\nGriffin Jax replaced Woods Richardson with a one-run lead in the seventh inning, and he immediately pitched himself into a bases-loaded jam after yielding two singles and a seven-pitch walk. It resulted in only one run during a 31-pitch inning. Mitch Garver drove in Jorge Polanco with a sacrifice fly to center, but Jax struck out two with the bases loaded.\n\nThe Twins didn't have a baserunner against Mariners ace Luis Castillo until Max Kepler reached on a two-base error to begin the fifth inning, a ground ball that bounced past first baseman Ty France along the first-base line. Carlos Correa, the next batter, hammered a belt-high 96-mph fastball off the center field wall for an RBI double.\n\nOne hit, one unearned run and the Twins knew it wouldn't be any easier to create offense.\n\nBOXSCORE: Twins 3, Seattle 1\n\nSeattle's pitchers entered Monday with a 1.74 ERA over their last 22 games. After completing a three-game series against the Boston Red Sox, Twins Manager Rocco Baldelli said seven straight games of \"some of the best pitching you're going to see all year long.\"\n\nThe Twins started their seventh-inning rally when Kepler drew a five-pitch walk and Correa followed with a double to left field. After an out at the plate -- Kepler was caught in a rundown when Willi Castro grounded to the first baseman -- the bottom two hitters in the Twins lineup delivered key runs.\n\nCastillo did everything he could to match Woods Richardson. He threw a first-pitch strike to his first 13 batters. He permitted two hits, both to Correa, and three walks in 6 2/3 innings with seven strikeouts.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Not that many fans back in the Pacific Northwest were watching or listening when Leo Rivas made the final out to end the 2-hour, 39-minute clunker.\n\n\"We didn't deserve to even be in the game,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said. \"We didn't play a good game obviously. Really, it was all series. The Twins outplayed us. They did. They swung the bat better, they pitched better, they executed better. Not much to say, other than they beat us bad in this game.\"\n\nRealistically, the outcome was decided when Logan Gilbert, the Mariners' best starter thus far in the 2024 season, gave up five runs in the bottom of the first.\n\nWhile teams can and have overcome five-run deficits over eight innings, there was nothing about Gilbert's early command or results that indicated the Twins wouldn't score more runs off him or off the relievers that would be brought in to mop up excessive innings.\n\nIt also meant that the Mariners' strikeout-laden offense would need to score an inordinate amount of runs against the best Twins best starter, Pablo Lopez, which seemed unlikely.\n\nThe Mariners have been so reliant on high-level outings from their starters that it's glaring when a pitcher such as Gilbert doesn't provide at least a quality start. And when a starter struggles, well, it's unnerving to the point of panic.\n\n\"The key for us has been our starting pitching,\" Servais said. \"It keeps us in the game, keeps the game tight and we find a way to win those games late. We did not do that today. The got rolling and we couldn't stop it.\"\n\nThe Mariners expected Gilbert to put a stop to the inconsistency and poor play with another strong start. He came into the game with a 3-0 record and 1.69 ERA -- the lowest in the American League -- in his seven previous starts. In all seven outings, he had pitched into the sixth inning and hadn't allowed more than four runs or five hits. In six of his starts, he allowed two runs or fewer.\n\nThe Twins needed just one inning to change those numbers.\n\nAll nine hitters in Minnesota's lineup came to bat in the first inning and Gilbert needed 36 pitches to finish it.\n\nIt started off dubiously with a four-pitch walk to Twins leadoff hitter Edouard Julien. Gilbert got Ryan Jeffers to pop out to second for the first out of the inning. With minimal command of his pitches, the Twins pounced on pitches left in the middle of the plate.\n\nTrevor Larnach ripped a hard single to center and Max Kepler scored Julien with a crisp single to right field. Gilbert got a tough break when Jose Miranda hit a check-swing bunt that turned into an infield single and loaded the bases.\n\n\"I was little out of sync it felt like at the beginning,\" Gilbert said. \"I had the four-pitch walk to start the game. I just wasn't really executing like I needed to. I felt like I was throwing two-strike edge pitches early in the count and then late in the count with two strikes throwing them over the middle of the plate.\"\n\nWhen Willi Castro popped out to foul territory without a run scoring for the second out, it looked like Gilbert might escape the inning with minimal damage.\n\nAll he had to do was retire Manuel Margot, who came into the game hitting .167 with a double, a homer, three RBI and 17 strikeouts in 67 at-bats. An 0-1 splitter hung in the strike zone, and Margot rippled it past Urias at third base for a bases-clearing double and a 4-0 lead.\n\n\"I don't think that (splitter) had a ton of depth,\" Gilbert said. \"Sometimes it can be tricky with starting point on a splitter because if it has good depth it gets to the right spot. If it doesn't have that depth it stays up because it doesn't have as much break. If I execute that, it could be a different story. But I've got to do a better job, especially in the first, just to give us a chance to stay in the game.\"\n\nFormer Mariner Carlos Santana kept the inning going with a hard single to right field to score Margot and make it 5-0.\n\nWith the suboptimal start to his outing, Gilbert tried to pitch as long as possible while not allowing more runs. Ryan Jeffers smashed a solo homer on a 1-2 cutter that stayed up and over the middle of the plate. The Twins added more runs in fourth inning.\n\nGilbert's final line: four innings, eight runs allowed on nine hits with two walks and four strikeouts. His ERA went from 1.69 to 2.94 in the one outing.\n\n\"In a game like this, you just try to stay in the game as long as you can and give us a chance to hopefully claw back,\" he said. \"But I just wasn't able to do it. It's frustrating. Even after the first inning, I have a job to do. I want to go as deep as I can and try to make up for a long first inning, but I just never really found it.\"\n\nLopez, a one-time Mariners prospect who was traded to the Marlins in 2017 along with three other minor leaguers for reliever David Phelps, struck out 10 batters and allowed one run over 6 1/3 innings.\n\nHis run allowed came in the second inning when Luke Raley singled to right field to score Mitch Haniger.\n\nThe Mariners managed six hits while striking out 15 times, which tied a season high. It was the 26th time they've struck out 10 times or more in a game. They have a 13-13 record in those games. But in 12 of those wins, the pitching allowed three runs or fewer. The Mariners, who came into the series striking out more than any other team, added 53 more over four games to that total. They have 399 on the season with Boston second at 369.\n\n\"It's been inconsistent,\" Haniger said of the offense. \"And I think for every guy, it's a little bit different than trying to bucket the entire offense into one category.\"\n\nAnd the strikeouts?\n\n\"I think one through nine (in the lineup) there's only a couple of guys that would tell you that they're really happy with how things have gone for them this year,\" Haniger said. \"Unfortunately for over a month now, the majority of the lineup has struggled together. That's why runs haven't been at a premium for us. I think it's only a matter of time before we get going, but at the same time it's not an excuse. We need to pick it up.\"", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Servais", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scott Servais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-finger_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Split-finger fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jeffers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Jeffers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Larnach", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Larnach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kepler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Kepler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Margot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Margot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bunt (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foul ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Raley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Raley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Haniger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Haniger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Phelps_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Phelps (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thumb.spokesman.com/Do5kgqWQ8touhNn4euRN_h1kTHQ=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2024/05/09/663d4120606d6.hires.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542343", "eventUri": "eng-9542343", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The impressive 12-game win streak had finally ended just one day before, but the dream that the fabled lump of meat represented was trying to live on. They kept the recipe, even if some of the original ingredients had run dry.\n\nWhile the club surely took pride in its nearly two weeks of wins, the hope wasn't just to honor that stretch but to replicate it. Game 1 against the visiting Seattle Mariners felt like a good place to start. However, the Twins quickly discovered that the challenge -- whether it be a dominant Luis Castillo facing them on the bump or the mere act of igniting a new win streak -- was going to be harder than expected.\n\nIt was going to take a full squad effort, with timely hitting and lockdown defense, to come out victorious against a dangerous Mariners club.\n\nAccomplishing such a feat would take patience. Through the first four frames of the game, Castillo held the eager Twins lineup hitless. Last year's Cy Young award finalist had his goods going in this one, needing only 49 pitches to get through the fourth inning. He spotted his fastball and mixed in a few wipeout sliders. He kept Minnesota's hitters off-balance, inducing a handful of easy fly balls and weak contact.\n\nHowever, in the fifth inning, a leadoff error by first baseman Ty France allowed Max Kepler to trot into second base. Carlos Correa drove him home with a hard-hit liner off the padding in right field.\n\n\"It's always fun to go against a guy like [Castillo]. He has a great name in this league,\" said Twins starter Simeon Woods Richardson after the game. \"He's a competitor. He throws strikes and gives his team the best chance to win. It's always fun to go toe-to-toe with someone like that.\"\n\nAnd as nasty as Castillo was for the Mariners, Woods Richardson matched him in nearly every category through six innings, even down to the pitch count. Woods Richardson dazzled, tossing six scoreless frames with eight strikeouts (a career-high) and allowing one hit and one walk. His counterpart had the exact same line but with one fewer strikeout.\n\nWhile the pitching excelled for the most part in this matchup, it wasn't all smooth sailing. The Twins were cursed momentarily by the ghosts of a past life, or at least from a couple of old friends. With the bases loaded and one out against Griffin Jax in the seventh, Mitch Garver belted a sacrifice fly to center field, driving in Jorge Polanco.\n\nBut like we saw countless times through the win streak, the Twins adjusted their approach and bounced back in the late innings. They chased Castillo with a series of hits and sacrifices in the bottom of the seventh, scoring two more to retake the lead.\n\nAt that moment, it was like the Rally Sausage never left.\n\nThe Twins were using the same recipe that they followed in their illustrious streak, albeit with a different main ingredient. They had sound pitching and clutch at-bats from the bottom of the lineup, including two walks from Carlos Santana and a crucial sac fly from Christian Vazquez. For the young hurler who secured another quality start, it's a metaphorical digging of the heels into a hopefully long career in the Twins rotation.\n\n\"I think [Woods Richardson] is getting more and more comfortable. I think he's coming into his own tremendously,\" said manager Rocco Baldelli, giving a glowing review for his starting pitcher. \"I can't really hope to send a guy out there and hand him the ball and get more than what he's giving us right now. He's stepped into a role where we needed someone in that spot to go out there and give us a chance to win every night.\"\n\nThat's also where the rest of the club finds itself. If they can continue to step up and find their roles in a competitive ball club, they'll give themselves a chance to win each game and start a brand new win streak after each one ends.", "source": {"uri": "zonecoverage.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zone Coverage"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lou_hennessy@zonecoverage.com", "name": "Lou Hennessy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(pitcher,_born_1992)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (pitcher, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(second_baseman)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (second baseman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_France", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ty France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kepler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Kepler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_Jax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Griffin Jax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Polanco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Polanco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_V\u00e1zquez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian V\u00e1zquez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Garver", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Garver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Baldelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocco Baldelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/zonecoverage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23207975_168390100_lowres-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1706&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542343", "eventUri": "eng-9542343", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

It isn't the first time or the last time that it will happen this season, but it was one of the frustrating ones. I hope I can convey this lesson because I don't always follow it enough. I have made a lot of money playing games with Logan Webb involved. He's been reliable for me, and even reliable this year with the exception of now three starts. The problem is I am not identifying when he is going to have those bad starts. One was yesterday and it cost me. My lesson is this: always be willing to reevaluate your stance on a team/player/situation because things can happen. Don't let any bias cloud your judgment. The lesson needs to be implemented tonight as well as I look to get a win on the Mariners and Twins.\n\nThe first bias I have for this game is the starting pitcher, Luis Castillo. I wrote an article about him this offseason, and how I thought he could end up being the Cy Young this year. He didn't exactly come out to an amazing start, but seems to have settled in a bit. He is now sitting at a 3.46 ERA with a 1.18 WHIP. His first three starts of the season saw him allow four earned in each game and he never completed six innings. Perhaps more alarming was that he allowed 25 hits in those 15.2 innings he threw to start the season. Luckily, he kept the walks down. As I mentioned, he has turned his season around, posting four consecutive quality starts. He has two games out of his last four which he has gone seven innings and allowed no earned runs. Twins hitters have been fairly productive against him, going 16-for-69 against him with six extra-base hits in there. The Mariners as a whole are playing good baseball right now, going 9-5 over their past 14 games. The Mariners are still not hitting very well as a team, but they are winning games and that's all that really matters. They have the best pitching staff in baseball though with a 2.98 ERA and 1.04 WHIP.\n\nThe Twins are a team that I suppose you can say I have a bias against. I just don't really like the franchise, but I suppose I have told myself this year to try and come into the season with an open mind. For the most part, I think I've done that. I said they were likely to repeat as the AL Central winners. So far, the Guardians are on top, the Tigers look to be a threat, and the Royals look improved, but the Twins could end up as the top team in the division. Their hitting has been decent, but not great. Their pitching staff really needs to lock in soon as their ERA is almost at four. That normally wouldn't be that bad but with the way the other teams are pitching it is hard for me to envision them winning with an ERA that high. Today they will have Simeon Woods Richardson throwing for them. He has a 2.45 ERA in just 14.2 innings. This will be the fourth start of the season for Woods Richardson, and he hasn't allowed more than two earned runs in any of the starts. He looks like he is fairly efficient with his pitching, but did throw 81 pitches in just 3.2 innings in his last start. The Mariners haven't seen him before so this could be an advantage he can capitalize on through the first few innings of the game.\n\nIf I throw out the names on the backs of the jerseys, I think the Mariners are still the better team. The Twins aren't terrible by any means and are probably better than I tend to give them credit for. However, this looks like it should be a low scoring game no matter what. I think Castillo is on a roll and has found his groove. Woods Richardson has pitched well to this point and should find a way to hold a struggling offense at-bat. Let's take under 8 in this one.\n\nFor more sports betting information and plays, follow David on X/Twitter: @futureprez2024", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_troy@outkick.com", "name": "David Troy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Webb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Webb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(second_baseman)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (second baseman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Castillo_(pitcher,_born_1992)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Castillo (pitcher, born 1992)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1480089083-copy-1024x578.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542343", "eventUri": "eng-9542343", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The Twins will give the ball to Bailey Ober.\n\nThe Mariners have Emerson Hancock on the mound, and he has thrown the ball well in his last four starts. In those four games, Hancock has not allowed more than two earned runs in any of them. In fact, Hancock allowed just one earned run in three of those four starts. He needs to continue this streak in this game. If Hancock continues to pitch well, the Mariners will be able to win this game.\n\nThe Twins do not have a great offense. It is not bad, but it is not great. Hancock has a good chance to shut down the Twins in this game and lead the Mariners to a win. Offensively, the Twins will strike out a decent amount, and they do not take their walks. Hancock has to keep the Twins from finding too many barrels and should be able to rack up a few strikeouts. Hancock should be able to limit his walks in this game and keep the Twins offense under control.\n\nWhy The Twins Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nBailey Ober has a little bit of an inflated ERA. He allowed eight runs on nine hits over 1.1 innings in his first start of the season. He now has a 4.55 ERA, and 1.05 WHIP. Take away that start, and Ober has a 2.37 ERA, 17 hits allowed, just one home run allowed, and 27 strikeouts in 30.1 innings pitched. His WHIP is well below 1.00, as well. He has been able to pitch very well since his first start of the season, and that can continue in this game.\n\nThe Mariners do not have great hitters. They strike out a bunch, their batting average is bottom-5 in the MLB, and their slugging percentage is bottom-10 in the MLB. Their offense is not great, so Ober should be able to continue pitching well in this game. He will limit the extra bases, and the Twins are 3-0 in his last three starts. As long as Ober continues his hot hand, the Twins are going to keep on playing well.\n\nFinal Mariners-Twins Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Twins just had a long win streak ended, but they have worked their way back up to second place in the AL Central. However, the Mariners have also been playing some good baseball, and they hold the top spot in the AL West division. This should be a good series, and both pitchers in this game are throwing the ball well. I will take the Twins to win this game straight up. Ober has been lights out lately, and I expect that to continue in this game.

Not that many fans back in the Pacific Northwest were watching or listening when Leo Rivas made the final out to end the 2-hour, 39-minute clunker.\n\n\"We didn't deserve to even be in the game,\" Manager Scott Servais said. \"We didn't play a good game obviously. Really, it was all series. The Twins outplayed us. They did. They swung the bat better, they pitched better, they executed better. Not much to say, other than they beat us bad in this game.\" t\n\nRealistically, the outcome was decided when Logan Gilbert, the Mariners best starter thus far in the 2024 season, gave up five runs in the bottom of the first.\n\nWhile teams can and have overcome five-run deficits over eight innings, there was nothing about Gilbert's early command or results that indicated the Twins wouldn't score more runs off him or off the relievers that would be brought in to mop up excessive innings.\n\nIt also meant that the Mariners' strikeout-laden offense would need to score an inordinate amount of runs against the best Twins best starter, Pablo Lopez, which seemed unlikely.\n\nThe Mariners have been so reliant on high-level outings from their starters that it's glaring when a pitcher such as Gilbert doesn't provide at least a quality start. And when a starter struggles, well, it's unnerving to the point of panic.\n\n\"The key for us has been our starting pitching,\" Servais said. \"It keeps us inthe game, keeps the game tight and we find a way to win those games late. We did not do that today. The got rolling and we couldn't stop it.\"\n\nThe Mariners expected Gilbert to put a stop to the inconsistency and poor play with another strong start. He came into the game with a 3-0 record and 1.69 ERA -- the lowest in the American League -- in his seven previous starts. In all seven outings, he had pitched into the sixth inning and hadn't allowed more than four runs or five hits. In six of his starts, he allowed two runs or fewer.\n\nThe Twins needed just one inning to change those numbers.\n\nAll nine hitters in Minnesota's lineup came to bat in the first inning and Gilbert needed 36 pitches to finish it.\n\nIt started off dubiously with a four-pitch walk to Twins leadoff hitter Edouard Julien. Gilbert got Ryan Jeffers to pop out to second for the first out of the inning. But with minimal command of his pitches, the Twins pounced on pitches left in the middle of the plate.\n\nTrevor Larnach ripped a hard single to center and Max Kepler scored Julien with a crisp single to right field. Gilbert got a tough break when Jose Miranda hit a swinging bunt that turned into an infield single and loaded the bases.\n\nWhen Willi Castro popped out to foul territory without a run scoring for the second out, it looked like Gilbert might escape the inning with minimal damage.\n\nAll he had to do was retire Manuel Margot, who came into the game hitting .167 with a double, a homer, three RBI and 17 strikeouts in 67 at-bats. But an 0-1 splitter hung in the strike zone and Margot rippled it past Urias at third base for a bases-clearing double and a 4-0 lead.\n\nFormer Mariner Carlos Santana kept the inning going with a hard single to right field to score Margot and make it 5-0.\n\nGilbert would allow another run in the second on a solo homer from Ryan Jeffers and two more in the fourth inning.\n\nHis final line: four innings, eight runs allowed on nine hits with two walks and four strikeouts.\n\nLopez, a one-time Mariners prospect, struck out 10 batters and allowed one run over 6 1/3 innings.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Servais", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scott Servais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jeffers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Jeffers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Larnach", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Larnach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Miranda_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jose Miranda (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kepler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Kepler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Margot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Margot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bunt (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foul ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infield hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-finger_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split-finger fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/yakimaherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/3e/43e73b28-1f81-5a7f-8f01-1c4f915ce369/663d34271f7c8.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542343", "eventUri": "eng-9542343", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Ryan Jeffers and Max Kepler each homered and drove in two runs, Jose Miranda scored three runs on two hits and Margot matched his career high with five RBIs for the Twins (22-15), who won for the 15th time in their last 17 games.\n\nThis matchup of premier American League starting pitchers didn't materialize at all. Gilbert (3-1) ominously issued a leadoff walk and hit his previous season high of five hits allowed in just eight batters.\n\nThe Twins got the bounces, like when Miranda checked his swing in the first inning and accidentally hit a slow-bouncing single up the third base line. But there were plenty of hard-hit balls, like the 104 mph drive Jeffers sent into the flower boxes above the wall in left-center field.\n\nGilbert failed to pitch into the sixth for the first time in eight starts this season. The 2018 first-round draft pick gave up eight runs, the most since he was a rookie in 2021, on nine hits and two walks while finishing five innings. The AL-leading ERA of 1.69 he took into the game rocketed up to 2.94.\n\nL\u00f3pez gave up one run on four hits without a walk in 6 1/3 innings.\n\nBut the stars of the show were at the plate for the Twins, who have averaged 6.6 runs and 10.1 hits over this 17-game surge. Kepler set his career high by stretching his hitting streak to 11 games and is batting .434 (23 for 53) with three homers and 14 RBIs in 16 games since coming off the injured list. Jeffers, who entered the game ranked third in the AL in OPS, went deep for the eighth time this season.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nTwins SS Carlos Correa was given a rest day after playing in nine straight games following his reinstatement from the injured list.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Mariners were waiting to announce their starter for Friday night, when they host Oakland to commence a three-game series.

Not that many fans back in the Pacific Northwest were watching or listening when Leonardo Rivas made the final out to end the clunker.\n\nRealistically, the outcome was decided when Logan Gilbert, the Mariners best starter in the 2024 season, gave up five runs in the bottom of the first.\n\nWhile teams can and have overcome five-run deficits over eight innings, there was nothing about Gilbert's command or stuff that indicated the Twins wouldn't score more runs off him or the relievers brought in to mop up innings.\n\nIt also meant that the Mariners' strikeout-laden offense would need to score an inordinate amount of runs against the best Twins best starter, Pablo Lopez, which seemed unlikely.\n\nThe Mariners have been so reliant on high-level outings from their starters that it's glaring when a pitcher such as Gilbert doesn't provide at least a quality start. And when a starter struggles, well, it's unnerving to the point of panic.\n\nGilbert came into the game with a 3-0 record and 1.69 ERA -- the lowest in the Americna League -- in his seven previous starts. In all seven outings, he had pitched into the sixth inning and hadn't allowed more than four runs or five hits. In six of his starts, he allowed two runs or fewer.\n\nThe Twins needed just one inning to change those numbers.\n\nAll nine hitters in Minnesota's lineup came to bat in the first inning and Gilbert needed 36 pitches to finish it.\n\nIt started off dubiously with a four-pitch walk to Twins leadoff hitter Edouard Julien. Gilbert got Ryan Jeffers to pop out to second for the first out of the inning.

He recorded one out, striking out a batter after giving up a leadoff single, but a taxed Twins bullpen needed every out they received from him.\n\nThe Twins held off the Seattle Mariners for a 6-3 victory at Target Field, using Caleb Thielbar, Griffin Jax and Jhoan Duran to cover the final 11 outs.

Eight of his 10 strikeouts came through his fastball.\n\nMitch Garver hit an opposite-field solo homer in the fourth inning on a first-pitch fastball, but no other baserunner reached third base against Paddack.\n\nMariners starter George Kirby, who finished eighth in last year's American League Cy Young voting, allowed one run over his last 20 innings entering Wednesday. The Twins had two runs after three batters.\n\nCarlos Correa and Trevor Larnach hit back-to-back 400-foot homers off Kirby in the first inning.

Following Castro's triple, Kirby and the Mariners bullpen retired 11 straight hitters.\n\nIn the eighth inning, with the Twins holding on to a one-run lead, Edouard Julien hit a one-out single to end an 0-for-14 slump.

One of them literally.\n\nCal Raleigh smacked the first pinch grand slam the Twins have given up in nine seasons, turning a Twins lead into a two-run deficit.\n\nBut Austin Martin's dive into first base while pinch hitting an inning later caused Seattle pitcher Tayler Saucedo to stumble awkwardly over first base, and the game-tying run scored while Saucedo writhed on the ground in pain, the ball in his glove.\n\nUltimately, though, the Mariners turned a leadoff triple by Dylan Moore into a four-run ninth, and the Twins lost for only the second time in 15 games, 10-6 at Target Field.\n\nRyan Jeffers smacked a three-run homer for the Twins, and Mitch Haniger hit a solo shot for the Mariners. But it was the strangeness of the Twins' game-tying rally in the eighth that overshadowed the biggest meltdown thus far by a Twins bullpen that has been one of the team's strengths.\n\nSign up for our Twins Update newsletter\n\nSaucedo entered the game with a 6-5 lead, and immediately gave up Max Kepler's second double of the night. After Carlos Correa popped up for the first out, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli sent Martin up to hit for Alex Kirilloff, 0-3 on the night. Martin worked the count to 3-2, and then hit a soft grounder to first baseman Ty France, who was positioned almost halfway between first and second base.\n\nSaucedo got a late start toward first base, and Martin beat him there, diving head-first into the bag. As Martin slid past, Saucedo seemed unsure of his footwork, and he collapsed to the ground a step past the bag. As he laid face-down in the dirt, in visible pain, Kepler rounded third base and reached the plate before France could retrieve the ball from Saucedo's glove.\n\nThe pitcher was eventually walked off the field with his arm around a Mariners' trainer, as many in the announced crowd of 14,710 applauded.\n\nThere wasn't much cheering a few moments later, when Seattle scored three runs off Jorge Alcala, who allowed Moore's triple, three singles, a walk and a wild pitch.\n\nThe Mariners' four runs were the first earned runs Alcala has allowed this year. In all, Twins relievers gave up eight runs over four innings.\n\nBOXSCORE: Seattle 10, Twins 6\n\nThe biggest blow, which turned a two-run Twins lead into a two-run deficit, was Raleigh's 445-foot grand slam off Steven Okert into the third deck in left field. Raleigh became the 12th pinch hitter ever to hit a grand slam against Twins' pitching, and the first since Cleveland's Jerry Sands victimized Blaine Boyer on Aug. 8, 2015.\n\nBailey Ober allowed only two runs on three hits and no walks, while striking out seven. But he had uncharacteristic difficulty in finishing off hitters, with six different at-bats extending to seven or more pitches. They added up, because Ober reached 84 pitches, tying his second-busiest outing of the year, after only five innings.\n\nOber left with a 4-2 lead, but Jay Jackson and Okert turned it into a deficit with a four-run seventh.\n\nMitch Carver reached on a hot-smash single that Carlos Correa reached, but too late to throw him out. Luis Arias singled Garver to third with one out, and Jackson walked Dylan Moore. Baldelli replaced Jackson with Okert, a lefthander, and Mariners manager Scott Servais sent up Raleigh, who delivered his eighth home run of the season.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com",

The Twins have won two of the series' first three games, including a 6-3 victory on Wednesday night, and have won 14 of their past 16 overall.\n\nTwins manager Rocco Baldelli praised his team for its approach Wednesday against another talented starter in Mariners right-hander George Kirby. Carlos Correa, Trevor Larnach and Willi Castro each homered against Kirby in the win.\n\n\"We were ready to hit,\" Baldelli said. \"You know that if you go up there in a passive manner against Kirby, you're going to be behind, and everything will be sloped in his favor throughout the game. And we can't let that happen. ...\n\n\"We were ready from the first pitch of the game for him. I think that's more than half the battle, and our guys connected. You're going to have to hit your way on. You're going to have to hit those runs across. He's not going to give you anything for free.\"\n\nThe same could be said for Gilbert.\n\nThe Mariners' ace has held opponents to two runs or fewer in six of his first seven starts. That includes his most recent performance in which he pitched eight scoreless innings against the Houston Astros on Saturday.\n\nThe Astros managed two hits and drew four walks against Gilbert. They also struck out six times as he threw 60 of 96 pitches for strikes and went on to earn his third victory in his past four outings.\n\n\"He was super aggressive,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said after watching Gilbert's most recent appearance. \"He was in the strike zone. That's a good fastball-hitting team, and you know you're going to have to mix in your secondary pitches, but you've got to get them over the plate. You've got to land them.\n\n\"I thought his slider, curveball, splitter at times tonight (dominated). Just outstanding command of those pitches in the zone, when they needed to be, and out of the zone, to get some chase.\"\n\nGilbert has faced the Twins three times in his career. He is 2-0 with a 1.69 ERA in those contests, walking three and striking out 18 in 16 innings.\n\nMinnesota will counter with its ace, as well.\n\nTwins right-hander Pablo Lopez (3-2, 4.30) is looking for his third win in a row after posting back-to-back victories against the Los Angeles Angels and Boston Red Sox. During his most recent start, also on Saturday, Lopez limited the Red Sox to one run on five hits in six innings, walking one and striking out eight.\n\nThis will be Lopez's third career start against Seattle. In his first two outings, he went 0-1 with a 3.00 ERA as he allowed four runs on 12 hits in 12 innings.\n\nMinnesota is 10-8 at home this season.

With the bullpen spent, a Pablo gem while scoring double digit runs couldn't come at a better time.\n\nWith the Twins up eight, Kody Funderburk and Josh Staumont reported for mop-up duty and held the Mariners to one run, despite a bit of traffic on the bases.\n\nOn the offensive end, the Twins kept the scoring going, plating runs against every Seattle pitcher who appeared. Ryan Jeffers and Max Kepler both homered, continuing their hot streaks, while the bottom of the lineup capitalized on some defensive miscues to keep the fun going.\n\nAlright, let's go streaking. The lengthy win streak is over, but there's still quite a few individual streaks that are equally impressive.\n\nWith the win, the Twins have won five straight series and are an MLB-best 15-2 since April 22nd. Their .863 team OPS in that span is second only to the Dodgers' star-studded lineup. In that same stretch, Twins starters have allowed more than three runs only twice, something that happened seven times in their first 20 games (though three of those were Louie Varland alone).\n\nSafe to say the Twins are back.

The Seattle Mariners are in town for one person and one person only: Jorge Polanco. The long-time Twin is sure to get a welcome ovation upon his return, but these Mariners are nothing to scoff at. With the best starting staff in baseball, the Twins will need their arms to bring their best stuff as well.\n\nNow that we're a full month into the season, we'll start moving away from the carryover from last season and stick with what's going on in 2024.\n\nQuite a bit! POBO Jerry Dipoto (or Trader Jerry if you're familiar with his work) is never a fan of standing pat, whether they have a good team or a bad one. After missing out on the playoffs on the final day of the regular season last year, the Mariners found themselves in a similar position to the Twins this offseason: wanting to get better, but without the payroll flexibility to take on salary.\n\nOn the Free Agent front, the Mariners lost OF Teoscar Hernandez and backup C Tom Murphy, but brought in old friend Mitch Garver to DH and relievers Ryne Stanek and Austin Voth. Pretty simple, right? Well, let's see where Trader Jerry got his nickname. Here are all the trades Seattle made this offseason:\n\nAnd that's just the players on the MLB roster. Dipoto made plenty of other minor trades and waiver claims, don't you worry.\n\nNow with all that shuffling around, Seattle's payroll came out to about $140 million, just a touch ahead of their 2023 number. However, all of their offseason acquisitions have combined for a grand total of -0.2 fWAR, which is not ideal. Garver, in particular, has really struggled to hit so far this season putting up a 75 wRC+ and -0.3 fWAR.\n\nThe money is also important in this case because many of the trades made by the Mariners had some funny money involved. The trade with the Giants was basically a swap of bad contracts, while the trade with the Braves was essentially a salary dump. Sure, they would have liked to get better results from Haniger and a healthy Kowar, but they were able to get off of the long-term money owed to Ray, Gonzales, and White, paying a hefty price to do so by giving up Kelenic.\n\nIf you were paying attention in the previous section, you may have noticed that none of the players they kept were starting pitchers. When you have the best rotation in the game with more reinforcements in the high minors, that's a luxury you can afford.\n\nCollectively, the Mariners' starting staff ranks 2nd in ERA, 1st in strikeout rate, 3rd in walk rate, and 3rd in fWAR. Individually, their ace trio of George Kirby, Luis Castillo, and Logan Gilbert are each in the top 10 in fWAR among AL starters. All three also rank in the top 10 in walk rate, and Bryce Miller joins them among their SPs in the top 15 in strikeout rate. Simply put: you don't score against these guys, let alone get on base.\n\nIf you get past their starters, it doesn't get any easier. Even without setup man Matt Brash, who has some of the filthiest stuff in baseball, the Mariners bullpen is in a great spot with none of their top 5 relievers by usage having an ERA over 3.00. Closer Andres Mu\u00f1oz is walking a few more batters than normal this year, but his sinker/slider combo still makes him impossible to hit.\n\nOne other player to watch is Julio Rodriguez, the Mariners' young superstar who has lost his power to start the season. Rodriguez has been an All-Star in each of his first two seasons, but has now made a habit of starting off slow. For an offense as lifeless as Seattle's, they desperately need their centerfielder to start hitting. Julio's talented enough to turn things around quickly, but hopefully he puts it off for at least another week.\n\nThe Mariners can't score but are leading the AL West on the backs of their ridiculously strong pitching staff. The Twins will need to keep Seattle's bats quiet if they want to take this series because they likely won't be getting much offensively.", "source": {"uri": "twinkietown.com", "dataType": "news",

Dylan Moore, the No. 8 hitter, then hit a double into the left-center gap that scored Urias from first for a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Twins went down in order in their half of the inning but their bats came alive for a four-run, two-out rally in the third off Seattle starter Emerson Hancock.\n\nAfter Willi Castro and Carlos Santana each flied out to center, Jose Miranda reached on a single to right. Edouard Julien then walked, and Trevor Larnach brought Miranda home from second with a sharp single to right to cut the Mariners' lead in half.\n\nThe next batter was Jeffers, and he hit the first pitch he saw from Hancock into the second deck in left -- on a rope -- to make it 4-2. The homer was Jeffers' seventh, tying him with Julien for the team lead.\n\nAfter Cole Sands pitched a 1-2-3 sixth, the Mariners made some hay against right-hander Jay Jackson.\n\nMitch Garver started the inning by beating out a slow grounder to short for a single, and after Jackson got Ty France looking, Moore hit a sharp single to left, and Garver went first to third.\n\nThat brought pitching coach Pete Maki to the mound, and Jackson got a high popup behind the plate from Moore. But Jeffers never got a good look at it, and it fell harmlessly in the warning track with Santana giving chase. That made the count full, but Moore took the next pitch for a ball to load the bases with one out.\n\nTwins manager Rocco Baldelli replaced Jackson with lefty Steven Okert, and Mariners manager countered with pinch-hitter Cal Raleigh, who cleared the bases with a no-doubter that traveled an estimated 445 feet before landing near the back of the second deck in left for a 6-4 lead.", "source":

Right-hander Logan Gilbert will get the start for the Mariners while the Twins will start their best pitcher Pablo Lopez, a one-time Mariners pitching prospect.\n\nKirby took the loss and was pulled after five innings and 70 pitches. He allowed four runs on four hits with a walk and four strikeouts. Three of those hits were solo homers and two came in the first inning to back-to-back hitters. Servais was adamant that pulling Kirby with such few pitches thrown wasn't due to a lingering knee issue. Kirby also said he felt fine.\n\n\"There's nothing physically wrong with George,\" Servais said. \"Everybody's got all these ideas, whatever. It was just not coming out right. He's had this happen before at different times. It was my call to take him out the game. George wanted to go back out there and there was no problem at all physically. With where we're at, he's going to make consecutive starts here on normal rest, we're playing the long game.\"\n\nWith one out, Carlos Correa jumped on a 1-1 curveball that hung over the middle of the plate, sending a deep drive into the Twins bullpen beyond the wall in left center.\n\nTwo pitches later, Trevor Larnach yanked an 0-1 slider into the right field seats to make it 2-0.\n\nKirby served up the third solo blast in the second inning. With one out, he left a 95-mph fastball in the middle of the plate. Willi Castro destroyed the mistake, sending a deep blast into the second deck in right field to make it 3-0.\n\n\"I was definitely a little off,\" he said. \"I didn't execute the way I wanted to. The mistakes I have been making, they haven't been resulting in three home runs. I was pitching behind counts, and that's when you lose some battles, but I'm just excited for next week, for my work this week and kind of flush this one.\"\n\nRight-hander Chris Paddack, once a touted pitching prospect in the Padres system before having a second Tommy John surgery, delivered a strong if not lengthy outing. He pitched 5 1/3 innings, allowing one run on eight hits with a walk and 10 strikeouts. He struck seven batters in the first three innings.\n\nThe Mariners' lone run off him came in the fourth inning when Mitch Garver hit a solo blast to right field. But Minnesota answered back immediately in the bottom of the inning. Kirby issued a one-our walk and Castro hit a triple into the right field corner to make it 4-1.\n\nIt looked like Raleigh would have at least an RBI single off Paddack in the fifth inning. With two outs and runners on first and second, he hit a hard ground ball up the middle that was gloved on a lunging/diving stop by second baseman Edouard Julien, who scrambled to his feet and fired to first for the final out.\n\nWith two outs in the seventh inning, Mitch Haniger worked a walk after getting behind 0-2 to reliever Griffin Jax. It brought Raleigh to the plate. He jumped on a first-pitch changeup to right field. The blast hit high off the tall wall and went for a double. But evening wind gusts that picked up late the game, knocked the ball down by 13 feet per MLB Statcast. Instead of tying the game, the Mariners trailed 4-3.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I think they would both be likely to be buyers though. The way that both of these teams are playing and the way they are pitching gives them hope even if their offenses aren't great. The deadline may be quite a bit of time away from here, but we can still start looking to predict what they will do while we predict what happens today between the Mariners and Twins.\n\nThe Mariners need offense if they want to keep this team above water and fighting for the division at the end of the season. As a team, they are only hitting .222 for the year, and that simply isn't enough to get the job done. They are in the bottom third in runs scored for the year, and that includes putting up 10 runs in the game against these Twins a couple of days ago. The pitching staff is keeping them afloat for now, but if they slip up a bit, the Mariners could find themselves in a major slump. Right now, the club has an ERA of barely above three runs per game, and their WHIP is hovering around one, which is outstanding for an entire team. Opponents are only hitting around .200 against them as well. Today, they have arguably their best pitcher on the team, Logan Gilbert, throwing for them. Gilbert is off to a great start with a 1.69 ERA and a 0.79 WHIP. On the season, he has six quality starts in seven outings, including five straight. He's only had one bad start this season (he allowed four earned runs on five hits, including three homers, over 5.2 innings), but it did come on the road. Twins hitters are batting .235 against him over 51 at-bats.\n\nThe Twins are a team that I've given a lot of crap to over the years. I have finally started to accept that maybe they aren't great, but they could be good enough. There isn't a ton of star power on the roster, but they have guys that find ways to get the job done. When I was watching one of their games, they had a stat about their record with and without Byron Buxton. It is alarming how much better they are with Buxton on the field than they are without him. Buxton isn't leading the team in any category, but his impact is interesting to mention. Another guy that the Twins rely on quite a bit is today's starter, Pablo Lopez. For some reason, Lopez was expected to compete for the Cy Young this season. I never really saw that being a realistic expectation for him, but he could be the leader of the staff. For the season, he has a 4.30 ERA and a 1.04 WHIP. His WHIP would indicate to me that his ERA is a bit inflated. Part of that is because he has allowed six homers in his 37.2 innings. He has allowed three or more runs in four of his seven starts this year. Mariners hitters aren't great against him, going just 8-for-36 against him.\n\nThis should be a relatively competitive game, but I do think the Mariners probably take it. I think the safer play here is to take the under. We have a day game after their evening game last night, and we have two strong pitchers. Lopez isn't pitching as well as Gilbert, but the Mariners aren't that strong offensively right now. I'd love to take the under but at 6.5 the line is fair.

The team's expectation had one group featuring team president Dave St. Peter and another with general manager Thad Levine and assistant GM Daniel Adler discussing what pitchers may be available and those who wouldn't.\n\n\"They're good issues,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.\n\nUndoubtedly, a team worrying about which high-leverage relievers could be ready to pitch and those who won't is directly correlated to the Twins winning 14 of their past 16 games, including Wednesday night's 6-3 victory over Seattle, one that secured a winning homestand. The stretch has turned around the team's fortunes, and even though the Twins sit in third place, it has increased their odds of winning the American League Central from 23.6 percent on April 21 to 52 percent.\n\nBut it also has the back end of a Twins bullpen already missing two key pitchers running a little thinner than the team's decision-makers would prefer. A night after Baldelli was forced to turn to the Nos. 5 through 8 relievers in his bullpen to secure a win, a plan that backfired as the group surrendered eight runs in a loss, he leaned heavily on Caleb Thielbar and Griffin Jax before turning to Jhoan Duran to close it out.\n\nThe trio combined to record 11 outs after Seattle quickly ran up starter Chris Paddack's pitch count, including Jax making his first multi-inning appearance since Aug. 17, 2022.\n\n\"I know our bullpen is thin right now, and when the team needs it I'll do it,\" said Jax, who allowed a run but secured a hold by pitching 1 2/3 innings. \"We've been getting used a lot, but it's a good thing. ... Played a lot of games in a row, a couple of short outings by pitchers. But when ballgames are close, generally the phone is going to be ringing in the bullpen no matter what. A lot of guys are getting used, but everyone's ready to do their job.\"\n\nThe Twins were 7-13 when this stretch began and are sitting at 21-15 after they guaranteed at least a series split with Seattle and a winning homestand following wins in two of three games against the Boston Red Sox over the weekend. The Twins' 14-2 stretch, one that's occurred over 17 days, has required a lot of heavy lifting from the team's high-leverage group.\n\nJax's appearance Wednesday was his eighth in 16 games and comes on the heels of a 31-pitch outing Monday. Thielbar, who took over for Paddack in the sixth inning and returned to record an out in the seventh, pitched for the seventh time in that span. And Duran, who returned from the injured list on April 30 and didn't have the benefit of pitching back-to-back games until rejoining the Twins, made his fifth appearance in nine days.\n\nWith Brock Stewart on the injured list and no day off until Monday, the Twins' late-innings options for Thursday are decidedly thin.\n\n\"We've played a lot of competitive games,\" Baldelli said. \"When you do that, you're going to run through relievers. Guys have to pitch, and they're going to have to pitch a lot. If you're not winning games, you don't have the same conversations. They're issues that you have to work through. ... They're issues that are coming from positive things.\"\n\nBut it's not just Jax, Duran and Thielbar who have seen high workloads.\n\nCole Sands, who's off to an outstanding start, has appeared seven times in the stretch with at least another game in which he warmed up but wasn't used, an effort the Twins count as similar to an appearance.\n\nSteven Okert, who surrendered a go-ahead grand slam in Tuesday's loss, has pitched six times.\n\nSome fans were livid when Baldelli pulled Bailey Ober after five innings Tuesday and then used Sands for only one inning, thinking he could have returned after a sharp sixth inning that kept the Twins in front by two runs. But with Sands having pitched Friday and Saturday and warming up Sunday, Baldelli knew the young pitcher needed to be taken care of as he threw for the fourth time in five days.\n\nWith Ober dealing with self-described mechanical issues and average stuff, Baldelli was more than happy to hand a two-run lead over to his short-handed bullpen even though he knew he'd need to rely on his lower-rung options.\n\nFollowing Sands' inning, Baldelli turned to Jay Jackson, Okert and Jorge Alc\u00e1la to close out the win because Duran was down and Kody Funderburk and Jax were only available in an emergency. The trio failed spectacularly, allowing eight runs and giving away a winnable game after which Alc\u00e1la, who threw 48 pitches over two innings, was optioned to Triple A in favor of a fresh arm, Josh Staumont.\n\nThe Twins hoped to receive bullpen relief this week in the form of Justin Topa, who hasn't pitched this season because of a sore left knee. But after struggling with his knee in a rehab outing Sunday, Topa underwent an MRI on Monday and was awaiting results.\n\n\"It's kind of like a day-by-day thing,\" Topa said. \"It comes and goes. Some days are better than others. We unfortunately hit a little rough patch the last game, so we'll see what the next step is here.\"\n\nThough the Twins received encouraging news from an MRI that Stewart had over the weekend on his right shoulder -- it showed only inflammation -- he's still far from returning after he was placed on the 15-day IL retroactive to Thursday.\n\n\"It all depends on how much time I take off of throwing,\" Stewart said. \"Obviously, I want to get back tomorrow, but that's not going to happen. Hopefully start playing catch by this weekend and then I'm sure a couple-week buildup. I think that's best-case scenario.\"\n\nAll of this is to say the Twins could run into a situation similar to Tuesday's, or even Wednesday's, several more times soon if they continue to play close ballgames.\n\nWednesday, Baldelli knew he asked a lot of Thielbar and Jax. Thielbar followed an outstanding effort from Paddack, who struck out 10 and limited Seattle to a run and eight hits with one walk in 5 1/3 innings. Similar to Ober the night before, Paddack scratched and clawed his way through, stranding seven base runners in his first five innings. He ended his outing with a strikeout of Ty France and handed the ball to Thielbar, who recorded the final two outs of the sixth inning.\n\nThielbar then returned and struck out Josh Rojas to start the seventh inning but exited after a Julio Rodr\u00edguez single. Jax entered and got Jorge Polanco to fly out and then appeared to strike out Mitch Haniger only for a check-swing call to go the hitter's way. Haniger eventually walked and Cal Raleigh belted a first-pitch changeup from Jax for a two-run double.\n\nBut Jax ended the threat by retiring Mitch Garver on a fly ball to center and returned to set down the side in order in the eighth.\n\n\"Caleb and Griffin were beyond important, they were essential in going out and doing that today on a day that we needed them to do it, and they knew it,\" Baldelli said. \"They knew the team needed that, and they went out there and did exactly what they needed to do.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"},

That included the last game, a 6-3 win over the Mariners, setting up for the series win.\n\nThe good times could come to a halt Thursday, though, as the M's trot out ace Logan Gilbert, who has gone 3-0 on the year, with a 1.69 ERA and 0.79 WHIP.\n\nGilbert has done work on the Twins too, with a 2-0 mark in three career starts, holding that 1.69 ERA with a WHIP of 1.06.\n\nSeattle hasn't been that great offensively, though, sitting 25th in runs scored, while ranking Bottom 10 in average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS.\n\nThe Mariners have been feast-or-famine of late. In their last seven games, they're 3-0 when posting five or more runs, while 0-4 when plating three or fewer.\n\nThey'll face righty Pablo Lopez in this one, a guy who's coming off wins in consecutive starts.\n\nLast time out, he held Boston to five hits and a single earned run in six innings of work, fanning eight -- the second-straight eight-strikeout game for him.\n\nThese two teams have crossed the total in four of the last five head-to-head matchups, but context matters here.\n\nIn Gilbert's seven starts, the Mariners and their opponent have combined to go Under the seven-run total six times.\n\nAssuming he shows up and those so-so M's bats run into Lopez pitching his best ball of the young season, I like this series finale staying low.\n\nEven in spot duty, Minnesota catcher Ryan Jeffers continued to swing a hot stick, picking up a pinch-hit double in Wednesday's win over Seattle.\n\nThat's now at least a hit in 14 of his last 15 games, lifting his average to a cool .303, while ranking inside the Top 25 in home runs and Top 15 in RBIs.\n\nHe also happens to be tied with Luis Castillo for the most experience against Gilbert,\n\nThough it's a small sample size, Jeffers does have two hits in six at-bats in his career against the righty. I like Jeffers to stay streaking Thursday.\n\nAdding Gilbert to the SGP ups the juice to +900, which is worth a splash, considering he's earned the decision in three of his last four outings.\n\nIn those wins, he pitched 13 innings, scattering just eight hits and giving up a single earned run.\n\nEven the start where Gilbert didn't factor into the decision, he gave up two runs on four hits in 6.1 innings of work against Arizona.\n\nIn his three career starts against Minnesota, he's pitched a total of 16 innings, giving up 14 total hits and three earned runs -- all Seattle wins.

Saucedo fell down and was injured on the play, allowing Kepler to score and tie the game at 6 a piece.\n\nThings unraveled for the Twins in the top of the 9th.

Mitch Haniger hit a sac-fly RBI, then Rojas scored on a wild pitch. A walk to Mitch Garver and an RBI single by Ty France gave the Mariners a 10-6 lead.

But there were plenty of hard-hit balls, like the 104 mph drive Jeffers sent into the flower boxes above the wall in left-center field.", "source": {"uri": "columbian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Columbian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_L\u00f3pez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pablo L\u00f3pez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jeffers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Jeffers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jose_Miranda_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jose Miranda (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kepler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Kepler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://pcdn.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24130687673259.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542343", "eventUri": "eng-9542343", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

They failed to make a difficult play on defense when needed. And they didn't do much in generating offense, striking out way too much ... again.\n\nNot even Cal Raleigh could rescue the Mariners from their overall mediocrity and looming defeat, though he sure tried and came close.\n\nBut Wednesday's 6-3 loss to the Twins offered a glimpse into how the Mariners successful start to the 2024 season can be considered flawed and doubted despite their recent success.\n\nGiven their tepid offense, inconsistent run production and propensity to strike out so often, the Mariners are almost totally reliant on the starting pitching to be somewhere from great to outstanding every game. They bullpen must be almost flawless while working with minimal margin for error while the defense must be mistake-free in its execution to back the pitching.\n\nIt's a tough way to survive in Major League Baseball and an even more difficult to stay atop a division or in a playoff race.\n\nSure, the Mariners offense has provided one-off exceptions to this trend of baseball, including a win 24 hours earlier where they scored 10 runs. But that sort of production, or even slightly less than that, has been rare and sporadic.\n\n\"Normally, our pitching does a great job to keep us in games,\" manager Scott Servais said. \"But you're gonna have to score runs, especially on the road. We've often talked about to win games and series on the road, you have to score. We had a big night last night, but we just couldn't carry over any of that momentum to early in the game tonight.\"\n\nGeorge Kirby struggled to keep the ball out of the middle of the plate, giving up hard contact and more runs than normal. The offense generated 10 hits, but also struck out 13 times and stranded a small village of baserunners, going 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position. Of the 13 strikeouts, eight of them came with a runner on base.\n\n\"The strikeouts have been frustrating all year long,\" Servais said. \"It's really hard to get rallies going and sustain any momentum without putting the ball in play. When you put ball in play, you get good results. It's different guys at different times in key spots in the game. And you can't get any momentum going.\"\n\nEven after Raleigh pulled the team within a run thanks to a two-run double in the seventh inning, the bullpen and defense allowed two late runs that made a comeback impossible against the Twins leverage relievers.\n\nSeattle's streak of six series wins ended with the loss. The Mariners will try to salvage a split in the four-game series with an afternoon game to close out the road trip. Right-hander Logan Gilbert will get the start for Seattle while the Twins will start their best pitcher Pablo Lopez, a one-time Mariners pitching prospect.\n\nKirby took the loss and was pulled after five innings and 70 pitches. He allowed four runs on four hits with a walk and four strikeouts. Three of those hits were solo homers and two came in the first inning to back-to-back hitters. Servais was adamant that pulling Kirby with such few pitches thrown wasn't due to a lingering knee issue. Kirby also said he was fine.\n\n\"There's nothing physically wrong with George,\" Servais said. \"Everybody's got all these idea, whatever. It was just not coming out right. He's had this happen before at different times. It was my call take him out the game. George wanted to go back out there and there was no problem at all physically. With where we're at, he's going to make consecutive starts here on normal rest, we're playing the long game.\"\n\nWith one out, Carlos Correa jumped on a 1-1 curveball that hung over the middle of the plate, sending a deep drive into the Twins bullpen beyond the wall in left center.\n\nTwo pitches later, Trevor Larnach yanked an 0-1 slider into the right field seats to make it 2-0.\n\nKirby served up the third solo blast in the second inning. With one out, he left a 95-mph fastball in the middle of the plate. Willi Castro destroyed the mistake, sending a deep blast into the second deck in right field to make it 3-0.\n\n\"I was definitely a little off,\" he said. \"I didn't execute the way I wanted to. The mistakes I have been making, they haven't been resulting in three home runs. I was pitching behind counts, and that's when you lose some battles, but I'm just excited for next week , for my work this week and kind of flush this one.\"\n\nRight-hander Chris Paddack, once a touted pitching prospect in the Padres system before having a second Tommy John surgery, delivered a strong if not lengthy outing. He pitched 5 1/3 innings, allowing one run on eight hits with a walk and 10 strikeouts. He struck seven batters in the first three innings.\n\nBOX SCORE\n\nThis story will be updated", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Servais", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scott Servais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Raleigh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cal Raleigh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kirby_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Kirby (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paddack", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paddack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_score_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box score (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/yakimaherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/57/e571c2c6-1898-5cb7-a368-d583f665cca0/663c41bcec258.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542343", "eventUri": "eng-9542343", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

It started slow Tuesday, but he settled into an impressive outing.\n\nIt took only three Seattle batters for the Twins to get through the first inning, but a Mitch Haniger home run and RBI double from Dylan Moore give the Mariners a 2-0 lead and Ober needed 24 pitches to get through the inning.\n\nThe Twins' bats began to heat up in the fourth inning.

Apparently, it never went away.\n\nTwo days after he suggested it was scheduled to be destroyed, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli revealed the team is still relying upon its famed summer sausage. With the offense struggling to score early in Monday's game against Seattle Mariners pitcher Luis Castillo, Twins hitting coach David Popkins went to the clubhouse to retrieve the team's good luck charm from a refrigerator to bring to the dugout.\n\nImmediately, the Twins offense, which was 0-for-12 at the time, broke through with a pair of doubles and scored a run off Castillo. Two innings later, the Twins tacked on two more runs and beat the Seattle Mariners 3-1 to win for the 13th time in 14 games. Though they previously planned to replace it with a fresh one, the Twins are suggesting they intend to give their sausage with its musty package and all a stay of execution.\n\n\"It's alive,\" Twins bench coach Jayce Tingler said. \"You could smell the rank when we brought it out in the bottom of the fifth inning. As soon as we brought it out, we were on the board.\"\n\nDormant for the first 20 games of the season, the Twins offense came to life in the first 10 games of a 12-game winning streak that was snapped on Sunday. The Twins scored 76 runs in that span, feasting on meaty pitches left over the plate by Chicago White Sox and Los Angeles Angels pitching staffs.\n\nBrought to the park by Kyle Farmer to be shared with teammates, the sausage didn't appear until midway through an April 25 win over the White Sox in which the Twins rallied from two runs down, homering five times in a span of 16 batters.\n\nThe fact of the matter is the Twins simply put together better all-around bats than they did in the first part of the season. But ask anyone in the Twins clubhouse, which is now inundated with sausage paraphernalia, and they'll tell you their resurgence was partly sausage-inspired.\n\n\"You've got to believe in something and we believe we're playing really good baseball,\" shortstop Carlos Correa said. \"We touch the sausage and we go out there super confident and good things happen.\"\n\nThe Twins believed in the sausage enough to take it on a tour of America, first flying it to Southern California and then back to Chicago, all without ever refrigerating it. For the team flight from Southern California to the Windy City, catcher Ryan Jeffers put the sausage in a Ziploc bag and then efficiently stuffed it inside one of his shoes.\n\nAt that point, Baldelli expressed concerns that the sausage would spoil and perhaps start a worldwide health epidemic. He also promised the team would replace the sausage with a fresh one after the winning streak ended. Though a prominent sausage expert allayed Baldelli's fears, suggesting the sausage could go for months as long as the packaging remained intact, the Twins began to refrigerate it after they returned home last Wednesday night.\n\nOnce the sausage made headlines, the Twins were inundated with offers from companies across the nation. During their current homestand, the Twins received boxes of summer sausages from team sponsor Sheboygan, squeezable rubber hot dogs from Oscar Meyer and even a 10-plus foot tall flag featuring the phrase \"Our sausage hits\" that was stationed in the coaches room.\n\nBut over the past four games, runs have been more difficult to come by as the Twins went up against the Boston Red Sox and Seattle Mariners, which entered Tuesday featuring the two lowest staff ERAs in baseball.\n\nDespite myriad chances in Sunday's streak-ending 9-2 loss, the Twins couldn't come through in the clutch, wasting several key chances with runners in scoring position. Asked about it after the game, Baldelli said the sausage was ticketed for the garbage.\n\n\"It might be in the trash by now -- honestly, where it belongs,\" Baldelli said. \"We can always get a new one. ... The guys throwing sausage around will be ready to go. Trust me.\"\n\nNot so fast, Rocco.\n\nJeffers and Popkins -- who's officially been deemed the keeper of the encased meat -- gave the sausage a second chance. Rather than listen to their manager, the duo overruled Baldelli and it reappeared Monday. The sausage also appeared early in Tuesday's game at the tail end of a four-run rally when the Sausage King himself, Jeffers, blasted a three-run homer.\n\n\"As soon as we brought it out, we were on the board,\" Tingler said.\n\nIn the midst of a perfect game, Castillo was no match for the power of the rally sausage. Max Kepler batted first in the fifth inning and hit a double off the bag at first base. Five pitches later, Correa doubled to right-center to produce the game's first run.\n\nTwo innings later, Kepler walked and Correa doubled again, which ultimately led to two more runs.\n\n\"I asked whether it was destroyed, I think they told me no,\" Baldelli offered up Monday when asked about the return of his red therapy light. \"We didn't score, we really didn't do anything for the first half of that game (Monday) and I think someone might have grabbed it and brought it back to the dugout. I don't know. You just look up and it's there.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether or not the sausage will accompany the team to Canada later this week when the Twins play a weekend series at the Toronto Blue Jays. The team already has received warnings about the strict nature of Canadian customs and how the sausage potentially could be confiscated.\n\nKnowing the potential for the loss of their omnipotent sausage, the Twins are considering alternatives, including purchasing a temporary kielbasa after landing in a town appropriately nicknamed \"Hogtown\" because of the amount of pork produced within city limits in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nWhether or not the Twins bring their tangy treat to Toronto, they intend to keep it around for some time.\n\n\"RJ's in charge of the sausage,\" Correa said. \"RJ decided it gets to stay. I don't know why we have to throw it away because of one game. If it's working, let's keep rolling with it.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_hayes@theathletic.com", "name": "Dan

They didn't do much in generating offense, striking out way too much ... again. And they weren't particularly clean in the field.\n\nNot even Cal Raleigh could rescue the Mariners from their overall mediocrity and certain defeat, though he sure tried and came close.\n\nBut Wednesday's 6-3 loss to the Twins offered a glimpse into how the Mariners successful start to the 2024 season is somewhat flawed in its accomplishment.\n\nGiven their tepid offense and propensity to strike out so often, they are totally reliant on the starting pitching to be great to outstanding, the bullpen to be almost flawless and the defense to be mistake free.\n\nIt's a tough way to survive in Major League Baseball.\n\nNot all strikes are good.\n\nGeorge Kirby struggled to keep the ball out of the middle of the plate, giving up hard contact and more runs than normal. The offense struck out 13 times and stranded a small village of baserunners. And after Raleigh pulled the team within a run thanks to a two-run double in the seventh inning, the bullpen and defense allowed two late runs that made a comeback impossible against the Twins leverage relievers.\n\nKirby took the loss and was pulled after five innings and 70 pitches. He allowed four runs on four hits with a walk and four strikeouts. Three of those hits were solo homers and two came in the first inning to back-to-back hitters.\n\nWith one out, Carlos Correa jumped on a 1-1 curveball that hung over the middle of the plate, sending a deep drive into the Twins bullpen beyond the wall in left center.\n\nTwo pitches later, Trevor Larnach yanked an 0-1 slider into the right field seats to make it 2-0.\n\nKirby served up the third solo blast in the second inning. With one out, he left a 95-mph fastball in the middle of the plate. Willi Castro destroyed the mistake, sending a deep blast into the second deck in right field to make it 3-0.\n\nRight-hander Chris Paddack, once a touted pitching prospect in the Padres system before having a second Tommy John surgery, delivered a dominant outing. The right-hander delivered a strong if not lengthy outing. He pitched 5 1/3 innings, allowing one run on eight hits with a walk and 10 strikeouts.\n\nSeven of those strikeouts came with Mariners runners on base.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_divish@seattletimes.com", "name": "Ryan Divish", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kirby", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Kirby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Raleigh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cal Raleigh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paddack", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paddack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/05082024_tzr_tzr_172850.jpg?d=1020x655", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542343", "eventUri": "eng-9542343", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Gilbert (3-1) ominously issued a leadoff walk and hit his previous season high of five hits allowed in just eight batters.\n\nThe Twins got the bounces, like when Miranda checked his swing in the first inning and accidentally hit a slow-bouncing single up the third base line. But there were plenty of hard-hit balls, like the 104 mph drive Jeffers sent into the flower boxes above the wall in left-center field.\n\nGilbert failed to pitch into the sixth for the first time in eight starts this season.

Kepler set his career high by stretching his hitting streak to 11 games and is batting .434 (23 for 53) with three homers and 14 RBIs in 16 games since coming off the injured list.

The Twins knew that someone was eventually going to end the streak, and Rocco Baldelli probably was ecstatic to throw the rally sausage away. He seemed concerned about his players' health. However, we don't know what, if anything, the streak portends.\n\nMinnesota was 7-13 before the streak started. By winning 12 straight games, the Twins cut the Cleveland Guardians' lead in the AL Central from eight to 2.5 games and improved their playoff odds from 34% to 71%. People are quick to point out that Minnesota's win streak was the second-longest in club history behind the 1991 squad that won 15 straight and eventually won the World Series.\n\nHowever, the 1980 Twins won 12 games in a row, and that club has mostly been lost to history. They won 12 of their final 14 games to finish 77-84, third in the AL West. That team was such a disappointment that manager Gene Mauch turned down a contract extension and retired in late August. Doug Corbett (5.7 WAR), John Castino (4.5), and Roger Erickson (4.0) were their three best players. Roy Smalley and Butch Wynegar are the only players you probably would have heard of on that team.\n\nTwelve wins in a row doesn't mean tell us much about this team, other than that they salvaged their season. It would have been unfortunate to follow up the first playoff series win since 2002 with a lost year.\n\nStill, things were looking that way. Injuries immediately started to pile up on this year's club. Jhoan Duran, Caleb Thielbar, and Justin Topa started the year on the injured list. Anthony DeSclafani likely will never pitch an inning in Minnesota. Royce Lewis got hurt on opening day. Brooks Lee is still having back issues. Carlos Correa missed 16 games.\n\nIt also doesn't help that fans are unhappy about the team cutting payroll and that Comcast subscribers cannot watch the games. Teams can withstand anger from fans; that means they care. But apathy is an organization's worst enemy, and the Twins were risking that a year after fan interest reached a crescendo following Minnesota's three-game sweep of the Toronto Blue Jays in the wild-card round.\n\nWithout the 12-game win streak, this year's team could have become as forgotten as the 1980 club. Except it would have been worse because the Twins were an 82-win team in 1979 and lacked a star after Rod Carew departed in 1978. Minnesota was an inconsistent team most of last year, finishing with 87 wins and coming off disappointing seasons in 2021 and 2022.\n\nHowever, they peaked at the end of last season. The Twins won eight of 11 games to finish the season, swept Toronto, and took Game 2 in Houston. They also seemed to be ushering in a new era. Derek Falvey and Minnesota's front office spent money, signing Correa ($200 million) and Byron Buxton ($100 million) to mega-deals and developing late-round pitchers like Bailey Ober and Louie Varland.\n\nThe Twins also made masterful trades for Pablo L\u00f3pez, Joe Ryan, and Duran. Lewis looked like the right choice at 1-1 in 2017, Edouard Julien was a savvy 18th-round pick, and Lee appeared ready for a major-league role. Minnesota was wise to stick with Max Kepler, who was hitting below the Mendoza line in June.\n\nIt was easy to question Minnesota's front office after their surprisingly disappointing 2021 season. After winning the AL Central in back-to-back seasons, they entered that year with World Series aspirations. However, they didn't have much pitching behind Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos and rookie Bailey Ober. Alex Colom\u00e9 had blown enough saves to ruin their season before it started, and Josh Donaldson looked like a failed signing.\n\nFans held the Twins to a higher standard this season, though. Winning division championships is one thing. The Ron Gardenhire era teams that. But winning in the playoffs had become a foreign concept. Still, while losing this season would have been more devastating from an on-field perspective, the front office is more proven.\n\nUnlike in the NFL and NBA, where young players are well-known entering the draft and can make an immediate impact, MLB prospect pipelines take years to construct. Therefore, continuity is paramount to a baseball team's success. Prospects can incubate in the minor leagues for five to seven years, and communication between a franchise's front office and the minor league is vital. Management changes can set teams back years because of philosophical and personnel changes.\n\nTwins ownership likely would have been patient with Falvey and Thad Levine. But if Minnesota had suffered a lost season after one month, it would mean that they would have missed the playoffs in three of the past four years. Add the payroll cut and Bally-Comcast standoff to the mix, and it would have been a devastating blow for a franchise that should have been building off its postseason run last year.\n\nMinnesota's 12-game win streak may have saved their season. Instead of throwing it away, they tossed the rally sausage in the trash and will move forward despite everything that has already happened this year. Still, they cannot become complacent. The 1980 and 1991 teams had long win streaks and finishing the year in vastly different places. But the Twins can bask in the afterglow. They have survived a 7-13 start. Now, we'll learn whether people will remember the first 20 games or the 12-game win streak years from now - if they remember this season at all.", "source": {"uri": "zonecoverage.com", "dataType":

After beginning the year on the injured list, Duran has now five scoreless innings in 2024.\n\nAnd furthermore, Duran also earned props on social media for his electric flamed-theme cleats.\n\nIn addition to the flame-theme, Duran also has the phrase \"104.5 MPH\" on the back of the shoes, a clear reference to his fastest fastball.\n\nOne of the hardest throwers we've ever seen, Duran is one of the best closers in the game. After debuting in 2022, he has 38 career saves, with 27 of them coming in 2023. He has struck out 181 batters in 135.0 career innings and could be a candidate for his first All-Star Game this season.\n\nThe Twins will go for a series win on Thursday afternoon when they take on the M's again at 1:10 p.m. ET. It will be an excellent starting pitching matchup as Logan Gilbert (SEA) pitches against Pablo Lopez (MIN).\n\nThere's no telling if Duran will be available as has only worked back-to-back days once since coming off the injured list.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kirby", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Kirby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closer (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3758,h_2113,x_0,y_191/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastball/01hxf22yqwdppy8fmbp7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542343", "eventUri": "eng-9542343", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

But then, when the Twins needed a hit, the sausage would come out into the dugout. Hits, home runs and wins would ensue.\n\nBut when the Twins finally lost a few days ago, manager Rocco Baldelli suggested it was thrown away, which would make sense because a sausage is a perishable food product.\n\nTurns out ... no.

We will inform you about this matter later.\"\n\nHe urged the army, government officials, administration, and members of law enforcement agencies not to take a stand against the people. \"They must play a role in ensuring that our roads are not stained with the blood of the people and the students, and our children are not martyred.\"\n\nThe BNP leader remained that those who are employees of the republic are not employees of any party or person. \"They are completely accountable to the people. Taking it into consideration, they should involve with people defying the unjust orders.\"\n\nReplying to a question about the consequence if the government does not resign, the BNP Secretary General said no one in history could stay in power in the face of a strong mass movement.\n\n\"The strong mass wave of crowd has spread. A few days ago, my wife asked me whether she would still stay at home. My daughters and everyone's daughters have gone out of homes...We saw this mass uprising in 1969, 90, 70 and 71. The mass awakening has now arisen again with much more force than that,\" he observed.\n\nFakhrul said only a handful of students, who are not even professional student leaders, have awakened the entire nation.\n\nStating that the government has destroyed the country in a planned way, he said now this is the time to stand up and resist the Awami League to it and now is the time to stand up against them. \"They have to be forced to resign and this this the high time for them to go.\"\n\nBlaming the government for the current situation, the BNP leader said the government is responsible for the current situation as they always committed crimes using the courts.\n\nHe said the government has made the situation so complicated over the quota issue that the students are now at a point of no return.\n\nIn this situation, Fakhrul warned that the more the government will buy time the more the nation will be affected and the Awami League will be harmed as a political party.\n\nThe BNP leader also said the ruling party is trying to spread fear in the public mind by creating various terror attacks and acts of sabotage. \"We want to say that they won't be able to prevent their fall by doing this.\"\n\nBNP Standing Committee members Mirza Abbas and Selima Rahman were present at the press conference.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Student activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheed_Minar,_Dhaka", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaheed Minar, Dhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Fakhrul_Islam_Alamgir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulshan_Thana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulshan Thana"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-cooperation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Mass_Uprising_in_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1990 Mass Uprising in Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Abbas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mirza Abbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selima_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selima Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Fascism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Fascism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/07/27/bnp_fakhrul_3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793376", "eventUri": "eng-9793376", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 15, "textEnd": 23}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Attendees included the chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, political party leaders, and civil society members.\n\nThis decision was made during a meeting at Bangabhaban after discussing the current situation with the chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, leaders of various political parties, and members of civil society, according to a press release signed by Muhammad Shiplu Zaman, Assistant Press Secretary of Bangabhaban.\n\nThe Army has been tasked with stopping the vandalism and ensuring law enforcement, which deteriorated severely after Sheikh Hasina left the country Monday afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has announced that Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, will be returning to the country very soon.\n\nHe disclosed this information to the media on Monday at 9:30 pm.\n\nThe BNP leader said, \"You all know that our leader, Tarique Rahman, has been unjustly exiled abroad due to false cases. He has fully supported this movement, and we have taken steps to bring him back to the country immediately. Insha'Allah, we will be successful.\"\n\nMirza Fakhrul added: \"It has been decided that our leader Begum Khaleda Zia will be released immediately. Those who were imprisoned for political reasons will also be released. Now, in the current situation, all political parties, students, and the public will work together to control it.\"\n\nAddressing the nation, he said: \"We have achieved a great victory, a great success.

This development was announced early Tuesday through a video message by key student leaders Nahid Islam, Asif Mahmud, and Abu Bakar Mazumdar.\n\nOn Monday night, Nahid Islam indicated that an outline for the interim government would be drawn up within 24 hours, following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and subsequent departure from Bangladesh. Her exit came after a violent crackdown on demonstrations initially sparked by job quota protests, which then escalated into demands for her resignation.\n\nAs the violence continued across Bangladesh, the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement leaders opted to declare their position overnight. President Mohammed Shahabuddin approved the formation of an interim government during a meeting at Bangabhaban, attended by military chiefs, political leaders, and civil society members.\n\nAccording to a press release from Bangabhaban's Assistant Press Secretary, Muhammad Shiplu Zaman, the Army has been tasked with restoring law and order, which deteriorated significantly after Sheikh Hasina left the country. Meanwhile, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir announced that Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, would soon return to Bangladesh.\n\nAlamgir addressed the media on Monday night, revealing that steps had been taken to bring back Rahman, who has been in exile due to alleged false charges.

Attendees included the chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, political party leaders, and civil society members.\n\nThis decision was made during a meeting at Bangabhaban after discussing the current situation with the chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, leaders of various political parties, and members of civil society, according to a press release signed by Muhammad Shiplu Zaman, Assistant Press Secretary of Bangabhaban.\n\nThe Army has been tasked with stopping the vandalism and ensuring law enforcement, which deteriorated severely after Sheikh Hasina left the country Monday afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has announced that Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, will be returning to the country very soon.\n\nHe disclosed this information to the media on Monday at 9:30 pm.\n\nThe BNP leader said, \"You all know that our leader, Tarique Rahman, has been unjustly exiled abroad due to false cases. He has fully supported this movement, and we have taken steps to bring him back to the country immediately. Insha'Allah, we will be successful.\"\n\nMirza Fakhrul added: \"It has been decided that our leader Begum Khaleda Zia will be released immediately. Those who were imprisoned for political reasons will also be released. Now, in the current situation, all political parties, students, and the public will work together to control it.\"\n\nAddressing the nation, he said: \"We have achieved a great victory, a great success. To maintain this success, let's show restraint, not act out of anger or hatred, not attack anyone, and not damage any institutions. Especially, let's not attack our religious minority brothers.\"\n\nMirza Fakhrul further commented that protecting minorities is everyone's responsibility, stating: \"It is our sacred duty to protect them.

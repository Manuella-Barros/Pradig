Henry Hodgson, the general manager for the league's UK office, told the Associated Press' Ken Maguire the work is underway to survey the necessary infrastructure. \"There's a feasibility study, as we would call it, in a number of different European cities and Dublin is one of those,\" Hodgson said. \"Looking at the stadiums, taking local meetings ... we'll take away all of that information, digest it and determine what the next steps are. \"That's something that's happening in Dublin, it's happening in Paris for example, and a number of other cities around the world as well.\" The NFL announced last December it would stage its first regular-season game in Brazil. NBC Sports' Peter King wrote about the International Series a month earlier and said, \"Spain and Brazil in the next two years, Paris in 2025 or beyond, and Dublin at some point soon.\" The allure of Paris is obvious. It's one of the most famous cities in the world and one that's no stranger to hosting marquee sporting events. The 2024 Summer Olympics will get underway in the French capital in July. Dublin is also a major staging ground, including for American football. The Aer Lingus College Football Classic has become a regular feature on the college football calendar, with Georgia Tech and Florida State making the trip this fall. The International Series is a pillar of the NFL's long-term plans, so it's only a matter of time before more cities are added to the mix. Widening its footprint in Europe rather than testing out a new market could be the next change.", "summary": "The NFL is performing its due diligence as it examines potential candidates to add to its International Series.

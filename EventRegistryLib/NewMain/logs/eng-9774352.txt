The Texas rapper declared to the enthusiastic audience that the United States is \"about to make history with the first Black female president\".\n\nThe Grammy-winning artist performed a dynamic set of four songs, including hits \"Girls in the Hood,\" \"Mamushi,\" \"Body,\" and \"Savage.\" As she introduced her track \"Body,\" Megan Thee Stallion addressed the crowd, saying, \"Now I know my ladies in the crowd love their bodies - and if you want to keep loving your body, you know who to vote for.\"\n\nIn her first trip to Georgia as a presidential candidate on Tuesday, Harris pledged Democrats will win a state the party had written off, and taunted Republican Donald Trump for backing out of a debate with her.\n\nThe momentum in this race is shifting, and \"Donald Trump is feeling it,\" Harris said, as the crowd of about 10,000 cheered and shouted her nascent campaign slogan \"We are not going back.\"\n\nWith less than 100 days left in one of the least predictable campaign seasons in recent history, Democrats are redrawing their map to victory, hoping the prospect of the first Black and Asian woman president can motivate Democrats to the polls.\n\nHarris' election campaign, hastily put together after President Joe Biden ended his re-election bid on July 22, has raised $200 million, and signed up 170,000 new volunteers.\n\nIn Atlanta, Harris embraced some Biden policy priorities, promising, \"On Day One I will take on price gouging and bring down costs.\" She said she would ban more hidden banking fees, take on corporate landlords and \"cap unfair rent increases\".\n\nShe also addressed immigration on the southern border, a top issue for Republican voters after the arrests of migrants crossing illegally reached a high during the Biden administration. Harris' role in trying to tamp down migration has drawn Republican criticism.\n\nTrump has been \"talking a big game about securing the border,\" but he does not walk the walk, Harris said. Trump pushed Republicans to tank a bill that would have funded more border security measures, she added, referring to a bill that failed in February.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion, whose album \"Megan\" recently launched at No. 1 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart, performed before Harris spoke while wearing a blue pantsuit and tie, the color associated with Harris' Democratic Party. \"Lets get this done hotties. Hotties for Harris,\" she told the crowd.\n\nGEORGIA IN PLAY?\n\nGeorgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, said on MSNBC over the weekend that Harris' entry into the race \"has put Georgia in play\" for Democrats and predicted she will win.\n\nSwing states like Georgia, which Democrats barely won in 2020, are fiercely contested because they can lean either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.\n\nFiveThirtyEight, the poll aggregation site, shows Republican Donald Trump leading Harris by between one and five percentage points in surveys taken after Harris became the likely Democratic candidate.\n\nSince Biden ended his reelection bid for the Nov. 5 vote against Trump, Harris has significantly outperformed him in recent polling among young people, Black voters and Hispanic voters.\n\nAfter Harris's speech, she appeared on a Zoom call with supporters, telling them \"this is a sprint\" and asking them to volunteer. Her campaign's battleground director Dan Kanninen said the team was looking at the \"Blue wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan to win the election, but was also hopeful about the \"Sun Belt.\"\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published on Thursday found Harris has narrowed a sizable Trump lead, while Trump had a two percentage point lead in a Wall Street Journal poll published on Friday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday showed Harris with a one point lead over Trump, down from two points in a July 23 poll.\n\nBiden's campaign saw a narrowing path to victory with the \"Sun Belt states,\" including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, as unlikely wins. Georgia backed Biden by 0.2 percentage points, just under 12,000 votes in 2020, and Trump by around 5 percentage points in 2016.\n\nAndy Beshear, the twice-elected Democratic governor of deep-red Kentucky, visited Georgia over the weekend to campaign for Harris in the Republican stronghold of Forsyth County.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota as possible vice presidential candidates. A decision is expected by Aug. 7.\n\nHarris is leaning into her resume as a former district attorney and California attorney general, seeking to draw a contrast with Trump who is the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes.\n\nTrump and 14 co-defendants are accused of racketeering and other charges for their role in attempting to overturn Biden's narrow win in Georgia.",

AP\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a cheering, boisterous, packed Atlanta arena on Tuesday that the next 98 days would be a fight, but they'd win come November, as she taunted Donald Trump for wavering on whether he'd show up for their upcoming debate.\n\n\"The momentum in this race is shifting,\" the likely nominee said. \"And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nLittle more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds. But now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map.\n\nIn the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris pulled off what has been a signature Trump event: A big, loud rally full of supporters cheering her name, as she mocked her rival and his running mate JD Vance as \"just plain weird,\" and derided their policies as backward, outdated and dangerous.\n\nTrump earlier said he'd debate Harris, but is now questioning the value of a meetup and saying he \"probably\" will debate her, but he \"can also make a case for not doing it.\"\n\nHarris seized on it. \"So he won't debate me, but he and his running mate have a lot to say about me,\" she said. \"And by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird.\"\n\n\"Well Donald,\" she said, addressing him head-on. \"I do hope you'll reconsider. Meet me on the debate stage &mldr; because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\" Trump has suggested the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to a different network, calling ABC \"fake news.\"\n\nHarris hasn't yet formally seized the Democrat nomination, though she is the only person who met the qualifications to vie for it, the Democratic National Committee announced Tuesday, and will all-but-certainly clinch it come Monday when the party concludes a virtual roll call vote. Her pick of a running mate is also expected by early next week when Harris plans to begin a seven-stop tour of battleground states to hold rallies alongside her vice presidential nominee.\n\nOn Tuesday, the roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and a performance by Megan Thee Stallion. Such an atmosphere would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities and ultimately ended his campaign.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris' campaign argues her appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nHarris began Tuesday with her days as a prosecutor -- setting up the contrast between the law and Trump's many legal problems and misdeeds. But she also aggressively defended the Biden administration's record and said she would work to pass voting rights legislation and restore abortion rights stripped by the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We're not going back,\" Harris said, shaking her head no as the crowd cheered \"we're not going back.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nIn a call with supporters after her speech, Harris thanked them for their work and noted early voting starts in some states in just 38 days.\n\n\"This is a sprint,\" she said. \"And we know what we need to do to cross the finish line.\"\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type":

But now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map.\n\nIn the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris pulled off what has been a signature Trump event: A big, loud rally full of supporters cheering her name, as she mocked her rival and his running mate JD Vance as \"just plain weird,\" and derided their policies as backward, outdated and dangerous.\n\nTrump earlier said he'd debate Harris, but is now questioning the value of a meetup and saying he \"probably\" will debate her, but he \"can also make a case for not doing it.\"\n\nHarris seized on it. \"So he won't debate me, but he and his running mate have a lot to say about me,\" she said. \"And by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird.\"\n\n\"Well Donald,\" she said, addressing him head-on. \"I do hope you'll reconsider. Meet me on the debate stage ... because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\" Trump has suggested the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to a different network, calling ABC \"fake news.\"\n\nHarris hasn't yet formally seized the Democrat nomination, though she is the only person who met the qualifications to vie for it, the Democratic National Committee announced Tuesday, and will all-but-certainly clinch it come Monday when the party concludes a virtual roll call vote. Her pick of a running mate is also expected by early next week when Harris plans to begin a seven-stop tour of battleground states to hold rallies alongside her vice presidential nominee.\n\nOn Tuesday, the roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and a performance by Megan Thee Stallion. Such an atmosphere would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities and ultimately ended his campaign.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris' campaign argues her appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nHarris began Tuesday with her days as a prosecutor -- setting up the contrast between the law and Trump's many legal problems and misdeeds. But she also aggressively defended the Biden administration's record and said she would work to pass voting rights legislation and restore abortion rights stripped by the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We're not going back,\" Harris said, shaking her head no as the crowd cheered \"we're not going back.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nIn a call with supporters after her speech, Harris thanked them for their work and noted early voting starts in some states in just 38 days.\n\n\"This is a sprint,\" she said. \"And we know what we need to do to cross the finish line.\"\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.", "source": {"uri": "wsav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSAV News 3"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person",

But now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map.\n\nIn the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris pulled off what has been a signature Trump event: A big, loud rally full of supporters cheering her name, as she mocked her rival and his running mate JD Vance as \"just plain weird,\" and derided their policies as backward, outdated and dangerous.\n\nTrump earlier said he'd debate Harris, but is now questioning the value of a meetup and saying he \"probably\" will debate her, but he \"can also make a case for not doing it.\"\n\nHarris seized on it. \"So he won't debate me, but he and his running mate have a lot to say about me,\" she said. \"And by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird.\"\n\n\"Well Donald,\" she said, addressing him head-on. \"I do hope you'll reconsider. Meet me on the debate stage ... because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\" Trump has suggested the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to a different network, calling ABC \"fake news.\"\n\nHarris hasn't yet formally seized the Democrat nomination, though she is the only person who met the qualifications to vie for it, the Democratic National Committee announced Tuesday, and will all-but-certainly clinch it come Monday when the party concludes a virtual roll call vote. Her pick of a running mate is also expected by early next week when Harris plans to begin a seven-stop tour of battleground states to hold rallies alongside her vice presidential nominee.\n\nOn Tuesday, the roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and a performance by Megan Thee Stallion. Such an atmosphere would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities and ultimately ended his campaign.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris' campaign argues her appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nHarris began Tuesday with her days as a prosecutor -- setting up the contrast between the law and Trump's many legal problems and misdeeds. But she also aggressively defended the Biden administration's record and said she would work to pass voting rights legislation and restore abortion rights stripped by the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We're not going back,\" Harris said, shaking her head no as the crowd cheered \"we're not going back.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nIn a call with supporters after her speech, Harris thanked them for their work and noted early voting starts in some states in just 38 days.\n\n\"This is a sprint,\" she said. \"And we know what we need to do to cross the finish line.\"\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Asked before arriving in Atlanta whether she has chosen a running mate, Harris told reporters: \"Not yet.\"\n\nBut her VP search apparently has accelerated, with Harris and her new running mate due to travel to multiple battleground states next week, US media reported, citing people familiar with the plans.\n\nAs for her evening rally in Atlanta, \"we do view Georgia as very competitive,\" Harris campaign battleground states director Dan Kanninen told reporters Monday.\n\nIn her speech, Harris will discuss \"the state of the race, reiterating that she is the underdog in this race but has real momentum and grassroots enthusiasm at her side,\" a campaign official said on background Tuesday, adding Harris is expected to call out Trump for so far refusing to honor his commitment to debate.\n\nIn a sign the southern state will be bitterly fought over, Trump and his running mate J.D.

We will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases. And we will take on big pharma to cap prescription drug costs for all Americans,\" she continued.\n\nHarris was joined by Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, former Rep. Stacey Abrams, and several other special guests, including Migos rapper Quavo and a graduate of Morehouse College, a historically Black university.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion performed at the Atlanta rally, getting the crowd energized with a performance of her hit song \"Savage\" and praising Harris as the would-be first Black, female president.\n\nOn a call with reporters ahead of her trip, Harris' campaign said Georgia, a formerly red state that voted blue in the last presidential election, is still \"in play.\"\n\n\"The vice president is energizing and mobilizing our base,\" said Dan Kanninen, the campaign's battleground states director. \"Having a candidate who can mobilize our key Biden-Harris coalition, talking about the issues that resonate with Georgians ... make that state in play.\"\n\nMORE: Harris' candidacy has led to surge in Black voter enthusiasm. It could make a difference in swing states\n\nSince President Joe Biden announced earlier this month that he was leaving the 2024 race, Harris has secured commitments from enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee if they all honor their commitment when voting, according to ABC News reporting.\n\nThe trip to Georgia comes as the campaign reported raising $200 million in less than a week since Biden dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. The campaign is also boasting 170,000 new volunteers who have signed up to back Harris. This past weekend to commemorate the 100-day mark from November's election, the campaign hosted 2,300 events across the battleground states with more than 29,000 volunteers participating.\n\nHarris' remarks at the rally followed a meeting with local reproductive rights leaders and activists.\n\nGeorgia played a crucial role in Biden's 2020 victory, going blue for the first time since 1992 due, in significant part, to organizing efforts from Abrams, who spent years spearheading get-out-the-vote efforts in Black communities. Harris' campaign will be looking to replicate success in Georgia by shoring up support among Black voters, a key group of voters that both Harris and former President Donald Trump will work to connect with as the November election approaches.\n\nMORE: In replacing Biden, Harris could keep blue states in the Democratic fold\n\nBiden only won the state by some 12,000 votes in 2020, a win heavily contested by Trump, who is currently in the midst of an election interference case in the state. Trump hasn't held a campaign event in Georgia since his debate with Biden in June.\n\nKanninen said that although the Harris campaign has achieved an impressive fundraising haul in a short amount of time, they are not getting \"comfortable.\"\n\n\"I continue to be very clear with our partners and with our own staff. This campaign will not get comfortable. We jumped in with just 100 days ago against an opponent who has shown he's willing to do anything to win,\" said Kannien. \"This is going to be an incredibly close race just like it was in 2020. But just like four years ago, we are going to win this thing.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign told reporters they expect the state to be just as \"competitive\" this election, claiming that their infrastructure in the state gives them an advantage.\n\n\"We expect it to be as close as competitive this year,\" said Communications Director Michael Tyler. \"That's why we have the team and the operation in place to make sure that we can turn out every single Harris voter in the state of Georgia.\"\n\nAccording to the campaign, they have more than 170 coordinated staff and 24 offices across the state with three of those opening this past weekend. The Trump campaign only recently opened its first campaign office in the state in June.\n\n\"We're making these investments across the entire map because the data is clear. We have multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes,\" said Kanninen. \"The vice president is strong in both the blue wall and in the Sun Belt and we are running hard in both.\"", "source": {"uri":

And we are the underdogs in this race.\"\n\nHarris's nascent presidential bid took off following Biden's July 21 exit from the race, with much of the party coalescing behind her and her campaign raising a staggering $200 million.\n\n\"The momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it,\" she said.\n\nThe Republican nominee recently said he would forego political tradition and not debate Harris, and also unleashed a barrage of insults against his rival, calling her \"crazy\" and a \"bum.\"\n\n\"Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face,\" Harris said, to roars of approval.\n\nHarris also repeated her popular line about how, as a former prosecutor and California attorney general going up against predators and fraudsters, she knows \"Donald Trump's type.\"\n\n\"In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,\" she said.\n\n- 'Extreme abortion bans' -\n\nWith just 98 days before the election, Harris is under pressure to announce her vice presidential pick. Asked Tuesday whether she had chosen one, Harris told reporters: \"Not yet.\"\n\nThe search must be nearing a conclusion, however, as her team announced Tuesday that Harris and her new running mate would campaign next week in battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nWith the White House race turned on its head, 59-year-old Harris on Tuesday unveiled her first television ad since replacing Biden, while the Trump camp released a dueling spot attacking her on the crucial election issue of immigration.\n\nHarris swatted away the attack, saying in her speech that while the Biden administration worked with conservatives to craft critical border legislation, Trump \"tanked\" it for political gain.\n\n\"Donald Trump does not care about border security,\" she said. \"He only cares about himself.\"\n\nHarris said if elected she would focus on key economic goals such as expanding affordable health care and tackling rising consumer costs.\n\nShe also attacked Trump, 78, over his \"extreme abortion bans,\" referring to restrictive new laws enacted in several states in the two years since the US Supreme Court -- featuring three justices nominated by Trump -- stripped constitutional protections for abortion.\n\n- Georgia in play -\n\nAs for Georgia's potential competitiveness, Harris insisted \"the path to the White House runs right through this state.\"\n\nIn a sign the southern state will be bitterly contested, Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance announced they would hold their own rally Saturday in Atlanta.\n\n\"Kamala Harris and her complicit cronies have made the great people of Georgia pay a hefty price for their woke policies,\" the Trump campaign said Tuesday.\n\nHarris took over a bleak electoral map from the faltering Biden, with Democrats' hopes entirely based on the three Rust Belt post-industrial states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut they are now looking again at other \"sunbelt\" states such as Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, all of which Democrats narrowly won in 2020.\n\nVance addressed a rally Tuesday in Henderson, Nevada, where he attacked Harris as \"dangerously liberal,\" while Trump campaigns in Pennsylvania on Wednesday.\n\nAdding some Atlanta glitz for younger voters was Megan Thee Stallion, the hip-hop star who performed before Harris took the stage.\n\ndk-mlm/aha\n\nMore from this section\n\nChurch of Scientology Forum on the Need for Sustainability\n\nInvestigation finds at

(AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\n\"The momentum in this race is shifting,\" the likely nominee said. \"And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nLittle more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds. But now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map.\n\nHarris hasn't yet formally seized the Democrat nomination, though she is the only person who met the qualifications to vie for it, the Democratic National Committee announced Tuesday, and will all-but-certainly clinch it come Monday when the party concludes a virtual roll call vote. Her pick of a running mate is also expected by early next week when Harris plans to begin a seven-stop tour of battleground states to hold rallies alongside her vice presidential nominee.\n\nIn the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris pulled off what has been a signature Trump event: A big, loud rally full of supporters cheering her name, as she mocked her rival and his running mate JD Vance as \"just plain weird,\" and derided their policies as backward, outdated and dangerous.\n\nHarris mentioned Trump's efforts to stop the passage of an immigration bill that had bipartisan support and would have been among the strongest border security in decades. She said she'd work to push the bill across the finish line. \"I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed and I will sign it and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.\"\n\nTrump earlier said he'd debate Harris, but is now questioning the value of a meetup and saying he \"probably\" will debate her, but he \"can also make a case for not doing it.\"\n\nHarris seized on it. \"So he won't debate me, but he and his running mate have a lot to say about me,\" she said. \"And by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird.\"\n\n\"Well Donald,\" she said, addressing him head-on. \"I do hope you'll reconsider. Meet me on the debate stage ... because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\" Trump has suggested the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to a different network, calling ABC \"fake news.\"\n\nThe roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and a performance by Megan Thee Stallion. Such an atmosphere would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities and ultimately ended his campaign.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris' campaign argues her appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nHarris began Tuesday with her days as a prosecutor -- setting up the contrast between the law and Trump's many legal problems and misdeeds. But she also aggressively defended the Biden administration's record and she'd work to pass voting rights legislation and work to restore reproductive rights stripped by the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We're not going back,\" she said, shaking her head no as the crowd cheered \"we're not going back.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nIn a call with supporters after her speech, Harris thanked them for their work and noted early voting starts in some states in just 38 days.\n\n\"This is a sprint,\" she said. \"And we know what we need to do to cross the finish line.\"\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Bulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type":

Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke.

Asked before arriving in Atlanta whether she has chosen a running mate, Harris told reporters: \"Not yet.\"\n\nBut her VP search apparently has accelerated, with Harris and her new running mate due to travel to multiple battleground states next week, US media reported, citing people familiar with the plans.\n\nAs for her evening rally in Atlanta, \"we do view Georgia as very competitive,\" Harris campaign battleground states director Dan Kanninen told reporters Monday.\n\nIn her speech, Harris will discuss \"the state of the race, reiterating that she is the underdog in this race but has real momentum and grassroots enthusiasm at her side,\" a campaign official said on background Tuesday, adding Harris is expected to call out Trump for so far refusing to honor his commitment to debate.\n\nIn a sign the southern state will be bitterly fought over, Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance announced they would hold their own rally in Atlanta on Saturday.\n\n\"Kamala Harris and her complicit cronies have made the great people of Georgia pay a hefty price for their woke policies,\" the Trump campaign said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nHarris took over a bleak electoral map from the faltering Biden, with Democrats' hopes entirely based on the three Rust Belt post-industrial states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut they are now looking hopefully again at other \"sunbelt\" states such as Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, all of which Democrats narrowly won in the 2020 election, her campaign said.\n\nVance addressed a rally Tuesday in Henderson, Nevada where the Republican swiftly attacked Harris as \"dangerously liberal,\" while Trump campaigns in Pennsylvania on Wednesday.\n\nIn Atlanta, Harris made an unscheduled stop at a restaurant known for its soul food and featuring photographs of prominent African-Americans on the walls, including civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nAdding some on-stage glitz for younger voters will be Megan Thee Stallion and fellow hip-hop star Quavo, frontman for the now-defunct Georgia group Migos. The two are the latest in a series of celebrity backers for Harris.\n\n\"Hotties I'm performing for THEE Kamala Harris today in Atlanta!!\" Megan posted on X.\n\nWith Harris admitting Democrats are the \"underdogs,\" the question is now whether a vice president who recorded historically low approval ratings but is seeing a rapid improvement as a candidate can maintain momentum until November.\n\nVance himself facing a bumpy first week amid reports the Republican Party has buyer's remorse over his naming to the ticket admitted that Harris's last-minute entry was a \"sucker punch,\" the Washington Post reported.\n\nThe race had seemed set to feature former president Trump, 78, against incumbent Biden, 81, but the Democrat's withdrawal due to concerns over his age now leaves Trump as the oldest major party nominee in US history.\n\ndk/mlm/bjt", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nHarris called on Trump to face her in a debate.\n\n\"I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage. Because as the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face,\" Harris said.\n\nA Trump spokesman has said that debate plans \"cannot be finalized until Democrats formally decide on their nominee.\"\n\nLittle more than a week before Harris' visit tonight, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map and welcoming the vice president to the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 with a show of political force intended to signal a new landscape against Trump.\n\nHarris said when she was reelected she was going to work to sign important legislation on immigration and \"show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.\"\n\nThe roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with thousands of voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and celebrating an atmosphere that would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris is hoping the rally, which featured a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30'' in places like Georgia.\n\n\"This campaign is about freedom,\" said Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who was there with his fellow Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. \"So the question is, do you want to be free? Or do you want to go back?\"\n\n\"When you show up, we win.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere, can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Warnock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raphael Warnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Georgia (U.S. state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Atlanta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Vice President Harris's trip to Atlanta, Georgia, comes as reenergized Democrats regard the swing state as being in play again, after it looked beyond hope under President Joe Biden before his shock withdrawal from the 2024 election. The presumptive Democratic nominee is aiming to expand the party's 2024 battleground map and appeal to young Black voters, delivering a firm, 20-minute speech to about 10,000 supporters in a packed arena and pledging Americans \"are not going back\" to the \"failed policies\" of Trump. \"Now, the baton is in our hands,\" Harris said to loud applause. \"We have a fight in front of us... And we are the underdogs in this race.\" Harris's nascent presidential bid took off following Biden's July 21 exit from the race, with much of the party coalescing behind her and her campaign raising a staggering $200 million. \"The momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it,\" she said. The Republican nominee recently said he would forego political tradition and not debate Harris, and also unleashed a barrage of insults against his rival, calling her \"crazy\" and a \"bum.\" \"Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face,\" Harris said, to roars of approval. Harris also repeated her popular line about how, as a former prosecutor and California attorney general going up against predators and fraudsters, she knows \"Donald Trump's type.\" \"In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,\" she said. With just 98 days before the election, Harris is under pressure to announce her vice presidential pick. Asked Tuesday whether she had chosen one, Harris told reporters: \"Not yet.\" The search must be nearing a conclusion, however, as her team announced Tuesday that Harris and her new running mate would campaign next week in battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. With the White House race turned on its head, 59-year-old Harris on Tuesday unveiled her first television ad since replacing Biden, while the Trump camp released a dueling spot attacking her on the crucial election issue of immigration. Harris swatted away the attack, saying in her speech that while the Biden administration worked with conservatives to craft critical border legislation, Trump \"tanked\" it for political gain. \"Donald Trump does not care about border security,\" she said. \"He only cares about himself.\" Harris said if elected she would focus on key economic goals such as expanding affordable health care and tackling rising consumer costs. She also attacked Trump, 78, over his \"extreme abortion bans,\" referring to restrictive new laws enacted in several states in the two years since the US Supreme Court -- featuring three justices nominated by Trump -- stripped constitutional protections for abortion. As for Georgia's potential competitiveness, Harris insisted \"the path to the White House runs right through this state.\" In a sign the southern state will be bitterly contested, Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance announced they would hold their own rally Saturday in Atlanta. \"Kamala Harris and her complicit cronies have made the great people of Georgia pay a hefty price for their woke policies,\" the Trump campaign said Tuesday. Harris took over a bleak electoral map from the faltering Biden, with Democrats' hopes entirely based on the three Rust Belt post-industrial states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. But they are now looking again at other \"sunbelt\" states such as Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, all of which Democrats narrowly won in 2020. Vance addressed a rally Tuesday in Henderson, Nevada, where he attacked Harris as \"dangerously liberal,\" while Trump campaigns in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Adding some Atlanta glitz for younger voters was Megan Thee Stallion, the hip-hop star who performed before Harris took the stage.", "source": {"uri": "globalnation.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@globalnation.inquirer.net", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

She threw down the gauntlet to Republican candidate Donald Trump, challenging him to confront her face to face in a debate. Not only that, but she also brought out Megan Thee Stallion and Quavo for special appearances on stage, making it a memorable political event!\n\nHere's What VP Kamala Harris' Said About Trump At Atlanta Rally\n\nSpeaking to a lively crowd in a packed arena in Atlanta, Kamala Harris, as reported by the Associated Press, declared that the next 98 days leading up to the election would be a tough battle, but their victory was inevitable in November. She also mocked Donald Trump for his indecision about participating in the upcoming debate.\n\n\"The momentum in this race is shifting,\" the likely Democratic nominee said. \"And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nInitially agreeing to the debate with Harris, Trump has now expressed uncertainty about its significance, stating that he might participate but could also argue against it. Furthermore, Trump has proposed moving the scheduled Sept. 10 debate, set to air on ABC News, to a different network, accusing ABC of being biased and labeling it as \"fake news.\"\n\n\"So he won't debate me, but he and his running mate have a lot to say about me. And by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird.\" She added, \"Well Donald...I do hope you'll reconsider. Meet me on the debate stage ... because, as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\"\n\nIn the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris pulled off what has been a signature Trump event: A big, loud rally full of supporters cheering her name. While on stage, she mocked her rival and his running mate, JD Vance, as \"just plain weird\" and described their policies as backward, outdated, and dangerous.\n\nVP Harris Discusses What's Next In Her Race To The White House\n\nFor context, Harris hasn't yet formally seized the Democratic nomination. However, the Democratic National Committee announced on Tuesday that she is the only person who meets the qualifications to vie for it. This means she will all but certainly clinch it come Monday (August 5) when the party concludes a virtual roll call vote.\n\nHer pick of a running mate is also expected by early next week. At that time, Harris plans to begin a seven-stop tour of battleground states to hold rallies alongside her vice presidential nominee.\n\nHarris began Tuesday with her days as a prosecutor -- setting up the contrast between the law and Trump's many legal problems and misdeeds. But she also aggressively defended the Biden administration's record and said she would work to pass voting rights legislation and restore abortion rights stripped by the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We're not going back,\" Harris said, shaking her head no as the crowd cheered \"we're not going back.\"\n\nSwipe below to see more clips from Kamala Harris' Atlanta rally.\n\nSpecial Guests At Atlanta Rally Included Megan Thee Stallion & Quavo\n\nOn Tuesday, the roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack 'Freedom' by Beyonc\u00e9, and a performance by Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nQuavo stepped to the mic and strongly endorsed the Vice President, citing his previous work with her on gun violence. He credited the politician for always standing \"on business.\"\n\n\"So if you never voted before, make sure you get out right now 'cause this the real one. And in the words of my brother Takeoff, let me get a 'Kamala,'\" Quavo said.\n\nGeorgia Senator Raphael Warnock also spoke passionately at the Atlanta rally about Kamala Harris' trek for the White House.\n\nThis week marks the second full one of Harris' campaign since first announcing her intent to replace President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee in the White House race. Biden stepped down on July 21 and shortly afterward endorsed his VP.

(Atlanta News First) - Kamala Harris touched down in Georgia on Tuesday for a kickoff rally in a state she knows well.\n\n\"Oh, it's good to be back in Georgia,\" said Harris, taking the state to cheers from a crowd of several thousand. \"The path to the White House runs right through this state.\"\n\nHarris may be right. Georgia, with 16 electoral votes, will be a massive prize on Nov. 5 for either presumably her or Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nTrump, alongside his new ticket-mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, will host their own rally at the very same Georgia State University Convocation Center venue in downtown Atlanta on Saturday.\n\nThe state is especially important for Democrats, looking to hold the traditionally-red-turned-blue state after Georgia all but handed the 2020 election to Harris and President Joe Biden.\n\nWith her budding candidacy, Harris got some help at her rally from some high-powered names. Democratic leader Stacey Abrams spoke prior to Harris arrival, as did Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and Georgia Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.\n\nGrammy-winning artist Quavo spoke for Harris before she came on stage, as did Grammy-winner Megan Thee Stallion, who performed just prior to Harris coming out.\n\n\"You all helped us win in 2020 and we going to do it again in 2024,\" Harris told the crowd. \"I don't have to tell folks in Atlanta that generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom. And now, the baton is in our hands.\"\n\nHarris laid out her plans to attack corporate land owners, a problem that Georgians face in particular. She also renewed her promise to slash bank fees and hidden charges, strengthen abortion protections, and sign the John Lewis Voting Rights Act as president if Congress passes it.\n\nAs she's done since launching her campaign, Harris played her past as a prosecutor against her presumptive opponent's multiple criminal convictions. It's a move that could play well with - or serve to further alienate - voters in Georgia, where Trump is facing one of his only remaining viable court cases in Fulton County.\n\n\"I took on perpetrators of all kinds,\" said Harris of her time as California's Attorney General. \"Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type.\"\n\nHarris is expected to announce her pick for running mate as early as the end of the week. After, she and whoever her VP pick is, will embark on a tour of battleground states next week, including a stop in Savannah.", "source": {"uri": "atlantanewsfirst.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nLittle more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map and welcoming the vice president to the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 with a show of political force intended to signal a new landscape against Trump.\n\nHarris said when she was reelected she was going to work to sign important legislation on immigration and \"show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.\"\n\nThe roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with thousands of voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and celebrating an atmosphere that would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris is hoping the rally, which featured a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\n\"This campaign is about freedom,\" said Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who was there with his fellow Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. \"So the question is, do you want to be free? Or do you want to go back?\"\n\n\"When you show up, we win.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere, can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@telegraphindia.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Warnock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raphael Warnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Georgia (U.S. state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Atlanta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

(Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spoke to a fired-up crowd Tuesday in Georgia where Democrats have been buoyed by her rise to the top of the ballot and what they see as a new opportunity to shut former President Donald Trump out of the White House.\n\n\"The path to the White House runs right through this state,\" Harris said to a packed Georgia State Convocation Center in downtown Atlanta. \"And you all helped us win in 2020 and we are going to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nThis was Harris' first visit to Georgia as the likely Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden's withdrawal upended the 2024 presidential race. But Harris has been a frequent visitor to Georgia as vice president, making Tuesday's rally her 15th stop here since being sworn in less than four years ago.\n\nThe shake-up at the top of the ballot has transformed a presidential race that was plagued with low voter enthusiasm, even dread for some.\n\nAnd the new energy was palpable Tuesday, with a performance from Megan Thee Stallion and warm-up speeches from a string of prominent Democrats and Atlanta rapper Quavo revving up the crowd ahead of Harris.\n\nSupporters filled the arena with deafening cheers and chants like \"not going back\" and \"too scared\" in reference to Trump backing out of a second presidential debate, but first against Harris. The spirited crowd at times drowned out the speakers. Harris walked out to rowdy applause and chants of \"Kamala.\"\n\nHarris taunted Trump for backing out of the debate schedule that he agreed to when Biden was still the expected Democratic nominee.\n\n\"Well, Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,\" she said. \"Because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\"\n\nHarris campaign aides told reporters Monday that they are seeing measurable signs of enthusiasm in the surge of volunteers and donations, but they recognize that 2020's razor-thin victory in Georgia will be a challenge to repeat. Biden won Georgia by less than 12,000 votes, making him the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state in three decades.\n\n\"Let's level set, friends, let's level set,\" Harris said to the boisterous crowd. \"We have a fight in front of us, and we are the underdogs in this race.\"\n\nThis crowd seemed eager for the challenge, and the opportunity to potentially elect a candidate whose presidency would make history was also electrifying the crowd.\n\n\"We will do the work of making Kamala Harris not only someone who breaks ties in the Senate but breaks barriers in the oval office,\" said Stacey Abrams, a former House minority leader who came close to becoming the nation's first Black woman governor back in 2018.\n\nBut the Harris campaign is also hoping moderate and disaffected Republicans will help deny Trump another term in the White House.\n\nFormer GOP Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who has been a vocal critic of Trump since the aftermath of the 2020 election, was seen on the sidelines at Tuesday's rally. Duncan endorsed Biden earlier and has since backed Harris as a means for getting the Republican party to move on past Trump.\n\nDuncan said Tuesday that the party lines \"are blurred more than ever\" today.\n\n\"This is a historical event that's going to take place,\" Duncan said in an interview. \"I think there's an opportunity for this country to hit the reset button even. It means we have to vote for somebody we don't agree with a hundred percent of their policies.\"\n\nTrump answered Harris' Georgia stop by announcing one of his own set for this Saturday at the same downtown Atlanta venue. The GOP nominee will campaign with his running mate, Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance.\n\nFormer GOP Congressman Doug Collins said Georgia Republicans are mentally adjusting to Harris as the new rival. To Collins, the shake-up at the top of the ticket is about Democrats trying to regain ground after Biden's disastrous debate performance in Atlanta a month ago.\n\n\"She can't run from an administration record and that's what most people, especially people on the left, have forgotten,\" Collins said Tuesday.\n\nSure, Democrats are excited to have a candidate they believe can take on Trump, Collins said. But he said he thinks the media's portrayal of Harris' impact on the race is \"over the top.\"\n\nGeorgia Democrats, though, would disagree.\n\n\"I'm so excited I can't sleep at night,\" said Gloria Jenkins, an 82-year-old who chairs the Democratic Party of Georgia's senior caucus who is thrilled at the prospect of potentially helping to elect the first Black woman president.\n\nBefore Harris became the likely nominee, Jenkins acknowledged the lagging energy in Georgia. But she said that has changed and that her constantly low cell phone battery - drained from all the election chatter - is as good a barometer as any.\n\nFor Diahann Fulwider, Harris' rise has inspired her to vote in November after she decided she would sit this one out when her disappointment in Biden turned into dismay as she watched the president struggle through the CNN debate last month.\n\nFulwider, who is a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., called the response to Harris' presidential candidacy \"a movement.\" Harris is also a member of AKA.\n\n\"It reenergized the middle-class Black woman,\" Fulwilder said of Harris' presidential campaign.", "source": {"uri": "penncapital-star.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pennsylvania Capital-Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Convocation_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State Convocation Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Atlanta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quavo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quavo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Collins_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Collins (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stacey Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Duncan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geoff Duncan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Kappa_Alpha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alpha Kappa Alpha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters. John Bazemore/Associated Press\n\nATLANTA -- Vice President Kamala Harris told a cheering, boisterous, packed arena on Tuesday that the next few months would be a serious fight and acknowledged the Democrats were right now the underdogs - but assured the crowd they would win in November.\n\n\"We have a fight in front of us,\" the likely nominee said. \"The momentum in this race is shifting. And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nLittle more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map and welcoming the vice president to the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 with a show of political force intended to signal a new landscape against Trump.\n\nHarris said when she was reelected she was going to work to sign important legislation on immigration and \"show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.\"\n\nThe roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with thousands of voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and celebrating an atmosphere that would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris is hoping the rally, which featured a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\n\"This campaign is about freedom,\" said Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who was there with his fellow Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. \"So the question is, do you want to be free? Or do you want to go back? When you show up, we win.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points - than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere, can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts - combined with strong Democratic campaigns - lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist - I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nInvestigation finds at least 973 Native American children died in U.S. government boarding schools filed under: election 2024, kamala harris Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_weissert@pressherald.com", "name": "Will Weissert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Warnock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raphael Warnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Atlanta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The momentum in this race is shifting, and \"Donald Trump is feeling it,\" she said.\n\nWith less than 100 days left in one of the least predictable campaign seasons in recent history, Democrats are redrawing their map to victory, hoping the prospect of the first Black and Asian woman president can motivate Democrats to the polls.\n\n\"We are not going back,\" Harris said to cheers and chants of about 10,000 attendees.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion, whose album \"Megan\" recently launched at No. 1 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart, performed in a blue pantsuit and tie, the color associated with Harris' Democratic Party.\n\nShe joins a host of musicians who have recently come out in support of Harris' bid to become the Democratic presidential nominee in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nGeorgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, said on MSNBC over the weekend that Harris' entry into the race \"has put Georgia in play\" for Democrats and predicted she will win.\n\nSwing states like Georgia, which Democrats barely won in a hard-fought battle in 2020, are fiercely contested because they can lean either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.\n\nFiveThirtyEight, the poll aggregation site, shows Republican Donald Trump leading Harris by between one and five percentage points in surveys taken after Harris became the likely Democratic candidate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 22 and endorsed Harris for the Nov. 5 vote against Trump. Since then, Harris' election campaign has raised $200 million, signed up 170,000 new volunteers and she has significantly outperformed Biden in recent polling among young people, Black voters and Hispanic voters.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published Thursday found Harris has narrowed a sizable Trump lead, while Trump had a two percentage point lead in a Wall Street Journal poll published on Friday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published July 23 showed a two-point lead for Harris.\n\nBiden's campaign saw a narrowing path to victory with the \"Sun Belt states,\" including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, as unlikely wins. Georgia backed Biden by 0.2 percentage points, just under 12,000 votes in 2020, and Trump by around 5 percentage points in 2016.\n\nAndy Beshear, the twice-elected Democratic governor of deep-red Kentucky, visited Georgia over the weekend to campaign for Harris in the Republican stronghold of Forsyth County.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota as possible vice presidential candidates. A decision is expected by Aug. 7.\n\nHarris is leaning into her resume as a former district attorney and California attorney general, seeking to draw a contrast with Trump who is the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes.\n\nTrump and 14 co-defendants are accused of racketeering and other charges for their role in attempting to overturn Biden's narrow win in Georgia.",

Harris' role in trying to tamp down migration has drawn Republican criticism.\n\nTrump has been \"talking a big game about securing the border,\" but he does not walk the walk, Harris said.

Her campaign's battleground director Dan Kanninen said the team was looking at the \"Blue wall\" states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan to win the election, but was also hopeful about the \"Sun Belt.\"\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published on Thursday found Harris has narrowed a sizable Trump lead, while Trump had a two percentage point lead in a Wall Street Journal poll published on Friday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday showed Harris with a one point lead over Trump, down from two points in a July 23 poll.\n\nBiden's campaign saw a narrowing path to victory with the \"Sun Belt states,\" including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, as unlikely wins. Georgia backed Biden by 0.2 percentage points, just under 12,000 votes in 2020, and Trump by around 5 percentage points in 2016.\n\nAndy Beshear, the twice-elected Democratic governor of deep-red Kentucky, visited Georgia over the weekend to campaign for Harris in the Republican stronghold of Forsyth County.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota as possible vice presidential candidates. A decision is expected by Aug. 7.\n\nHarris is leaning into her resume as a former district attorney and California attorney general, seeking to draw a contrast with Trump who is the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes.\n\nTrump and 14 co-defendants are accused of racketeering and other charges for their role in attempting to overturn Biden's narrow win in Georgia.\n\n(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Heather Timmons, Stephen Coates, Deepa Babington, Chris Reese and Christian Schmollinger)",

And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nLittle more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map and welcoming the vice president to the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 with a show of political force intended to signal a new landscape against Trump.\n\nHarris said when she was reelected she was going to work to sign important legislation on immigration and \"show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.\"\n\nThe roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with thousands of voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and celebrating an atmosphere that would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris is hoping the rally, which featured a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\n\"This campaign is about freedom,\" said Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who was there with his fellow Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. \"So the question is, do you want to be free? Or do you want to go back?\"\n\n\"When you show up, we win.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere, can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11 TriCities\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox41yakima.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 41 Tri Cities Yakima"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fox41yakima.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "bill_barrow@fox41yakima.com", "name": "Bill Barrow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "will_weissert@fox41yakima.com", "name": "Will Weissert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Warnock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raphael Warnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Georgia (U.S. state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Atlanta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nLittle more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.\n\nBut now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map and welcoming the vice president to the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 with a show of political force intended to signal a new landscape against Trump.\n\nHarris said when she was reelected she was going to work to sign important legislation on immigration and \"show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.\"\n\nThe roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with thousands of voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and celebrating an atmosphere that would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris is hoping the rally, which featured a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\n\"This campaign is about freedom,\" said Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who was there with his fellow Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. \"So the question is, do you want to be free? Or do you want to go back?\"\n\n\"When you show up, we win.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere, can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"},

Meet me on the debate stage ... because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\" Trump has suggested the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to a different network, calling ABC \"fake news.\"\n\nThe roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and a performance by Megan Thee Stallion. Such an atmosphere would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities and ultimately ended his campaign.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris' campaign argues her appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nHarris began Tuesday with her days as a prosecutor -- setting up the contrast between the law and Trump's many legal problems and misdeeds. But she also aggressively defended the Biden administration's record and she'd work to pass voting rights legislation and work to restore reproductive rights stripped by the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We're not going back,\" she said, shaking her head no as the crowd cheered \"we're not going back.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nIn a call with supporters after her speech, Harris thanked them for their work and noted early voting starts in some states in just 38 days. She hasn't yet formally seized the nomination, nor picked a running mate; both are expected soon.\n\n\"This is a sprint,\" she said. \"And we know what we need to do to cross the finish line.\"\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Voters have pegged the surge in migrants across the southwest border as one of the defining issues of the 2024 election.\n\n\"She owns every single one of the Biden administration's failure over the last four years,\" said Trump's running mate Senator JD Vance of Ohio at a rally in Reno, Nevada, Tuesday. \"She unleashed the worst border crisis in American history on her watch.\"\n\nHarris' campaign believes her popularity among key voting groups -- including women, younger voters and people of color -- is putting more states in play, according to people familiar with their thinking. Harris has seen a wave of enthusiasm from Democratic voters and lined up support from party heavyweights and donors since entering the race for president -- a little over a week ago.\n\nThe excitement among the roughly 10,000 supporters gathered in the arena was on display. Rapper Quavo introduced her and musician Megan Thee Stallion performed in a blue suit and a crop top, floating a new slogan \"Hotties for Harris,\" which gained traction on social media. The state's Democratic senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, also made appearances.\n\nTurning out Black voters in cities like Atlanta will be key to Democratic hopes of holding the White House. Biden narrowly carried Georgia in 2020 but polls showed his support among Black voters and young voters who helped drive him to victory had weakened. That unpopularity, also fueled by broad voter discontent with his handling of the economy, largely confined Biden to a narrow path to victory dependent on holding a trio of key Great Lakes states.\n\nThe vice president is shifting that dynamic, targeting not only the so-called Blue Wall of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania but also vying for Sun Belt states Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nPolling boost\n\nPolls have shown Harris narrowing the gap with Trump. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult survey conducted from July 24 to 28 found Harris erasing Trump's lead among voters in seven battleground states likely to determine the election. Harris is backed by 48 percent of voters to 47 percent for Trump, an edge within the margin of error.\n\nIn Georgia, the two are tied with 47 percent support each, with 51 percent of voters in the state saying they are more likely to vote now that Biden is not seeking reelection.\n\nBoth Trump and Harris' campaigns have indicated they see Georgia in play. Tuesday's rally marks the 15th time Harris has been to the Peach State -- which is home to 24 campaign offices.\n\nTrump and Vance are holding a rally in Atlanta on Saturday. The Republican nominee and his allied super political action committee have booked $14.7 million in advertising in Georgia through the end of August, according to AdImpact. That's almost triple the $4.9 million that Future Forward PAC, which backs Harris, is set to spend.\n\nHarris' campaign on Tuesday launched a $50 million ad campaign in battleground states touting her background as a prosecutor. The announcement did not specify how much would be spent in Georgia.\n\nHarris is also expected to announce her pick for vice president in the coming days, ahead of an Aug. 7 roll call vote to officially nominate the Democratic ticket.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nLittle more than a week ago, Georgia appeared to be slipping out of the Democrats' reach: President Joe Biden's campaign pledged to concentrate more on holding the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states and indicated they might be willing to forsake \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds. But now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris pulled off what has been a signature Trump event: A big, loud rally full of supporters cheering her name, as she mocked her rival and his running mate JD Vance as \"just plain weird,\" and derided their policies as backward, outdated and dangerous.\n\nTrump earlier said he'd debate Harris, but is now questioning the value of a meetup and saying he \"probably\" will debate her, but he \"can also make a case for not doing it.\"\n\nHarris seized on it. \"So he won't debate me, but he and his running mate have a lot to say about me,\" she said. \"And by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird.\"\n\n\"Well Donald,\" she said, addressing him head-on. \"I do hope you'll reconsider. Meet me on the debate stage ... because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\" Trump has suggested the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to a different network, calling ABC \"fake news.\"\n\nHarris hasn't yet formally seized the Democrat nomination, though she is the only person who met the qualifications to vie for it, the Democratic National Committee announced Tuesday, and will all-but-certainly clinch it come Monday when the party concludes a virtual roll call vote. Her pick of a running mate is also expected by early next week when Harris plans to begin a seven-stop tour of battleground states to hold rallies alongside her vice presidential nominee.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOn Tuesday, the roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and a performance by Megan Thee Stallion. Such an atmosphere would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities and ultimately ended his campaign.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris' campaign argues her appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nHarris began Tuesday with her days as a prosecutor -- setting up the contrast between the law and Trump's many legal problems and misdeeds. But she also aggressively defended the Biden administration's record and said she would work to pass voting rights legislation and restore abortion rights stripped by the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We're not going back,\" Harris said, shaking her head no as the crowd cheered \"we're not going back.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nIn a call with supporters after her speech, Harris thanked them for their work and noted early voting starts in some states in just 38 days.\n\n\"This is a sprint,\" she said. \"And we know what we need to do to cross the finish line.\"\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

And we are the underdogs in this race.\"\n\nHarris's nascent presidential bid took off following Biden's July 21 exit from the race, with much of the party coalescing behind her and her campaign raising a staggering $200 million.\n\n\"The momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it,\" she said.\n\nThe Republican nominee recently said he would forego political tradition and not debate Harris, and also unleashed a barrage of insults against his rival, calling her \"crazy\" and a \"bum.\"\n\n\"Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face,\" Harris said, to roars of approval.\n\nHarris also repeated her popular line about how, as a former prosecutor and California attorney general going up against predators and fraudsters, she knows \"Donald Trump's type.\"\n\n\"In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,\" she said.\n\n- 'Extreme abortion bans' -\n\nWith just 98 days before the election, Harris is under pressure to announce her vice presidential pick. Asked Tuesday whether she had chosen one, Harris told reporters: \"Not yet.\"\n\nThe search must be nearing a conclusion, however, as her team announced Tuesday that Harris and her new running mate would campaign next week in battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nWith the White House race turned on its head, 59-year-old Harris on Tuesday unveiled her first television ad since replacing Biden, while the Trump camp released a dueling spot attacking her on the crucial election issue of immigration.\n\nHarris swatted away the attack, saying in her speech that while the Biden administration worked with conservatives to craft critical border legislation, Trump \"tanked\" it for political gain.\n\n\"Donald Trump does not care about border security,\" she said. \"He only cares about himself.\"\n\nHarris said if elected she would focus on key economic goals such as expanding affordable health care and tackling rising consumer costs.\n\nShe also attacked Trump, 78, over his \"extreme abortion bans,\" referring to restrictive new laws enacted in several states in the two years since the US Supreme Court -- featuring three justices nominated by Trump -- stripped constitutional protections for abortion.\n\n- Georgia in play -\n\nAs for Georgia's potential competitiveness, Harris insisted \"the path to the White House runs right through this state.\"\n\nIn a sign the southern state will be bitterly contested, Trump and his running mate J.D.

Nikema Williams, chair of the Democratic party of Georgia, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Greg Bluestein.\n\nFour hours before the expected start of Harris' 7:00 p.m. ET speech, the line for entry stretched down far down the city block outside the university's Convocation Center, which has an official capacity of more than 7,500.\n\nIn a display of Harris' bipartisan appeal, former Georgia Lieutenant Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican, is expected to attend. Georgia Democratic lawmakers like Williams and U.S. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock will also be there, along with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.\n\nIn the week since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race against former President Donald Trump, Harris has enjoyed a surge of grassroots momentum and high-dollar donations.\n\nThe wave of support potentially puts swing states like Georgia back on the map for Democrats, after months of slipping support with Biden helming the ticket.\n\n\"You've heard us talk about the need to have the infrastructure across all the battlegrounds to win close elections, but it's clear the Vice President is energizing and mobilizing our base,\" Harris campaign battleground director Dan Kanninen said Monday on a call with reporters.\n\nOnce a deep red stronghold, Georgia has been in play for Democrats over the past few election cycles due to growing populations of Black and Latino voters that make up a major part of the party's base.\n\nBut polls showed Biden lagging with those same demographics this year, a trend that Harris' campaign is hoping its new presidential candidate can help reverse.\n\nSince Biden's exit, Harris has raised over $200 million, two-thirds of which came from new donors, according to the campaign. The campaign has also hugely boosted its volunteer force with 360,000 new volunteer sign-ups.\n\nThe Georgia event marks Harris' second official rally of her 2024 presidential campaign, though surrogates, including VP hopefuls, have stumped for her in thousands of events including roughly 2,300 over the weekend.\n\nHarris' first rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin drew a crowd of over 3,000 people, then the largest of any of the campaign's events this election cycle.\n\nWith just under 100 days until the November election and even less time until early voting kicks off, the campaign is hoping it can translate the wave of initial Harris hype into real swing-state wins.\n\nPolls have so far found that Harris has revived the race against Trump, closing the gap with voters and bringing the election back to a near dead-heat.\n\nDespite the honeymoon phase that has characterized Harris' first week as a 2024 presidential candidate, the campaign is not ignorant of the uphill battle ahead.\n\n\"We are the underdogs in this race,\" Kanninen said Monday. \"Our task now is to translate that enthusiasm into action.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The likely Democratic nominee acknowledged that rising prices have hit U.S. households, and she pledged that boosting the middle class would be a \"defining\" theme of a Harris presidency.\n\nOn immigration, Harris was not subtle about blaming her Republican rival Donald Trump for killing a bipartisan Senate deal that would have addressed border security and the U.S. government's ability to handle asylum seekers and other migrants who cross the border illegally.\n\n\"He tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help win him an election,\" Harris said, \"which goes to show Donald Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself.\"\n\nRepublicans have identified immigration and inflation as perhaps the two biggest liabilities for Harris. They already had spent months hammering President Joe Biden on those matters before he ended his reelection bid.\n\nEx-prosecutor Harris: 'I know Donald Trump's type'\n\nKamala Harris is leaning into her record as a prosecutor, telling thousands of supporters in Atlanta that her experience in the courtroom, as district attorney and as California attorney general make her ready to take on Republican Donald Trump.\n\n\"In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds,\" she said. \"Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who ripped off consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type.\"\n\nHarris said, \"In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day.\"\n\nHarris ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination making similar arguments but could not break through a crowded field. This time, Democrats believe the argument is especially resonant as Harris takes on Trump directly -- this time after he's been convicted on 34 felony counts and has three additional pending indictments.\n\nGeorgia's Democratic senators work the crowd for Harris\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff called Republican former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, \"strange men with dangerous ideas.\" When he talked about Trump, the crowd briefly chanted, \"Lock him up!\"\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock said \"everybody knows that the road to the White House goes through Georgia.\" He added that Trump \"is trying to steal your vote. Kamala Harris is trying to earn your vote.\"\n\nWarnock also drew long boos when he recalled Trump recently suggesting that, after November, Christians \"in four years, you don't have to vote again.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign says 10,000 people are attending the raucous rally at Georgia State University's Convocation Center. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at the same venue on Saturday.\n\nStacey Abrams amps up the crowd at Harris' Atlanta rally\n\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams is leading off an Atlanta rally for Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, stirring the largest crowd the vice president's nascent bid has attracted since President Joe Biden ended his campaign and endorsed his top lieutenant.\n\nAbrams twice lost governor's races in Georgia but is credited with rebuilding the Democratic Party in the state and paving the way for Biden to carry the state in 2020 and for U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to win tight races that tilted the chamber to Democratic control.\n\n\"People discounted Georgia. They dismissed Georgia,\" Abrams said of 2020 forecasts that did not consider the historically conservative state a battleground until late in the campaign. \"They didn't know Georgia.\"\n\nAbrams urged the assembly to maintain their enthusiasm and \"not let Donald Trump raze the ground and salt the earth.\"\n\n\"We watched what happened for four years and we're not going back,\" Abrams said.\n\nGoogle autocomplete results around Trump lead to claims of election interference\n\nWith fewer than 100 days until the 2024 election, social media users are claiming that a lack of Google autocomplete results about former President Donald Trump and his attempted assassination are evidence of election interference.\n\nMany posts include screenshots showing what the autocomplete feature, which predicts what users are trying to type, has generated for text such as \"attempted assassination of tr\" or \"president donald.\" Among the pictured results for the former phrase are references to other assassination attempts, including that of Harry Truman and Gerald Ford, but nothing for Trump. The latter provides two options -- \"president donald duck\" and \"president donald regan.\"\n\nIt is true that Google's autocomplete feature as of Monday was not finishing certain phrases related to Trump and the assassination attempt as shown in screenshots spreading online, but there is no evidence it was related to election interference. Completed searches about Trump and the assassination attempt done on both Monday and Tuesday yielded extensive relevant results regardless of what autocomplete predictions came up.\n\nGoogle told the AP that its autocomplete feature has automated protections regarding violent topics, including for searches about theoretical assassination attempts. The company further explained that its systems were out of date even prior to July 13, meaning that the protections already in place couldn't take into account that an actual assassination attempt had occurred.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation says Project 2025 is not going away\n\nProject 2025's website will remain live and the group will continue vetting resumes for its nearly 20,000-person database of potential officials eager to execute its vision for government, the Heritage Foundation said Tuesday.\n\nThe group said project director Paul Dans will leave the Heritage Foundation in August and Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts will now run Project 2025 operations. Roberts has faced criticism in recent weeks after he said on an episode of former Trump aide Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast that the country is in the midst of a \"second American Revolution\" that will be bloodless \"if the left allows it to be.\"\n\nEarlier this month, in an interview before beginning a prison sentence for defying a congressional subpoena, Bannon mentioned Roberts as the type of leader who could land a top job in a Trump White House. Roberts has written a book that will be released on Sept. 24 called \"Dawn's Early Light: Taking Back Washington to Save America.\" An advance blurb for the book lists government agencies and outside groups \"that conservatives need to build, others that we need to take back, and more still that are too corrupt to save.\"\n\n\"All these need to be dissolved if the American way of life is to be passed down to future generations,\" the blurb says. \"The good news is, we're going to win.\"\n\nThe author of the foreword to Roberts' book is JD Vance, the Ohio senator Trump picked as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nA speaking invitation from Trump splits the most prominent American group for Black journalists\n\nDonald Trump's invitation to address the National Association of Black Journalists has sparked an intense debate within the organization and a flurry of arguments online.\n\nJournalism organizations for people of color traditionally invite presidential candidates to address their summer gatherings during election years. But Trump's acceptance of NABJ's invitation has led at least one high-profile group member to step down as a convention co-chair and others to argue their convention may become a platform for Trump to make false claims or be seen as winning NABJ's endorsement.\n\nThe debate over NABJ's invite reflects how many journalists are still grappling with how to approach Trump nearly a decade after his first presidential run. Some group members argued journalists should give newsmakers an opportunity to be heard, while others pointed to Trump's demeaning of prominent Black journalists, as well as his frequent falsehoods and attacks on the free press, including labeling reporters \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee and first Black woman to hold her office, is not currently scheduled to address the convention. A person familiar with her schedule, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Harris campaign was unable to find a time to appear at NABJ in person and claimed the organization turned down an offer for her to appear virtually.\n\nTop Biden aid leaves White House to join Democratic super PAC\n\nOne of President Joe Biden's top aides is leaving the White House to advise the primary Democratic super PAC supporting Vice President Kamala Harris' bid for the White House, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAnita Dunn, who has served as a senior adviser in the West Wing and has overseen communications and messaging both at the White House and Biden's former campaign in Delaware, will be taking an advisery role with the group Future Forward, the person said on the condition of anonymity to discuss her plans.\n\nBiden praised Dunn in a statement, saying, \"I deeply value her counsel and friendship and I will continue to rely on her partnership and insights as we finish the job over the next six months.\"\n\nDunn and her husband, Biden's personal attorney Bob Bauer, had come under criticism from some Biden allies for their roles in preparing the president for his disastrous June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. Biden's performance sparked a tidal wave of concern within his part over his ability to take on Trump in November that culminated in his decision last Sunday to quit the race and endorse Harris in his stead.\n\nBiden, though, according to another person familiar with the matter, had made clear to Dunn and Bauer that he took responsibility for the debate and didn't blame them.\n\nWith funeral behind them, family of fire chief killed in Trump assassination attempt begins grieving\n\nThe funeral is over. The crowds have left. Now the hard work of grieving is beginning for the family of a former fire chief who was shot and killed during the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.\n\nCorey Comperatore's sister, Dawn Comperatore Schafer, is mad at the scammers trying to collect money on their behalf fraudulently. She is trying to understand how it all happened.\n\nMostly, though, she is shattered. She said the family got through the funeral with the love and support of thousands of people. \"They kept us standing,\" she said. But, she added, it doesn't stop after that. \"The aftermath is just that. You sit with the loss,\" she explained.\n\n\"We're hoping the next several weeks coming ahead is when we can really wrap our heads around all of this. We're trying to get out of the noise. And that's very hard to do, as you can imagine. But that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to get out of the noise.\"\n\nThe noise has been constant for the Comperatore family from the moment a bullet aimed at Trump killed her 50-year-old baby brother, who was a spectator at the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"He was there,\" she said of her brother, \"because he loved this country. He wanted his country and the people's lives to improve.\"\n\nProject 2025 director leaves Heritage Foundation after Democrat attacks and Trump criticism\n\nThe director of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a vision for a complete overhaul of the federal government, has stepped down according to a spokesperson for the think tank. Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said in a statement the group is sticking to its original timeline and director Paul Dans' exit comes after the project \"completed exactly what it set out to do\" and that the \"tool was built for any future administration to use.\"\n\nBut the news came after former President Donald Trump has increasingly disavowed and criticized Project 2025, prompting speculation that his campaign forced the exit.\n\n\"President Trump's campaign has been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the President in any way,\" Trump campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement.\n\nMany Trump allies and former top aides contributed to the project, which proposes a mass firing of government employees and sweeping changes to American life. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign and top Democrats have repeatedly tied Trump to Project 2025 as they argue against a second Trump term. A statement from Harris' campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez called Project 2025 Trump's \"agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country.\"\n\nKari Lake aims to win GOP primary for closely watched Arizona Senate race\n\nKari Lake is looking to easily win the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Arizona on Tuesday, setting up a fierce battle against Democratic U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nIn Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix and 60% of Arizona's voters, Republicans will also choose between a slate of incumbents who have stood up to former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election and challengers who claim it was stolen.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said it will monitor compliance with federal voting rights laws in Maricopa County for Tuesday's primary. County Sheriff's officials told Phoenix radio station KTAR that any attempts to disrupt vote centers, harass poll workers or prevent voting will be punished.\n\nThe primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress.\n\nDonald Trump to attend Black journalists' convention in Chicago\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is planning to attend the National Association of Black Journalists' annual convention in Chicago on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement released Monday night, the Trump campaign said the Republican presidential nominee would participate in a question and answer session \"that will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nTrump's campaign has spent months scheduling appearances in areas outside his traditional strongholds of support, including when he attended -- and was roundly booed at -- the Libertarian Party convention in Washington earlier this year.\n\nIn its announcement, the campaign trumpeted Trump policies that it argued benefited Black Americans during his first term.\n\nHarris pivots to convincing Arab American voters of her leadership\n\nVice President Kamala Harris appears to be trying to convince Arab American voters in crucial Michigan that she is someone they can unite behind. Community leaders are watching closely for signals that she will be more vocal in pressing for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nMany in metro Detroit, home to the nation's largest Muslim population, have expressed a willingness to listen, and some have had initial conversations with Harris' team. Many had grown exasperated with President Joe Biden after they felt months of outreach had not yielded many results.\n\n\"The door is cracked open since Biden has stepped down,\" said Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud. \"There's an opportunity for the Democratic nominee to coalesce the coalition that ushered in Biden's presidency four years ago. But that responsibility will now fall on the vice president.\"\n\nHarris did not attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent address to Congress, and some Arab American leaders interpret her absence as a sign of good faith with them.\n\nTrump says Harris, married to a Jewish man, doesn't like Jewish people\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said in a radio interview Tuesday that Vice President Kamala Harris, who is married to a Jewish man, \"doesn't like Jewish people\" and appeared to agree with a radio host who called second gentleman Doug Emhoff \"a crappy Jew.\"\n\nTrump, speaking on radio station WABC, claimed Harris looked uncomfortable while meeting last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"You can see the disdain,\" he said. \"No. 1, she doesn't like Israel. No. 2, she doesn't like Jewish people. You know it, I know it and everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it.\"\n\nThe Republican former president then said, \"If you're Jewish, if you vote for a Democrat, you're a fool, an absolute fool. They have let Jewish people down since Obama at a level that nobody could believe.\"\n\nAs the interview went on, Trump again said Harris \"dislikes Jewish people.\" The interview host, Sid Rosenberg, then mentioned Emhoff and said, \"He's Jewish like Bernie Sanders is Jewish. Are you kidding me?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Trump said.\n\n\"He's a crappy Jew,\" Rosenberg said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Trump said again.\n\nRosenberg went on, saying of Emhoff, \"He's a horrible Jew.\"\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said, \"America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump. Vice President Harris believes Americans want a president who unites our country instead of divides it, uses the power of the presidency to help families instead of hurt them, and has a vision for our future, instead of taking us backwards.\"\n\nHarris' potential running mates walk a fine line\n\nDemocratic governors and other officials under consideration to be Democrat Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate are practicing a time-honored tradition in presidential campaigns. They're walking the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss in what amounts to unofficial auditions.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro campaigned for Harris on Monday outside Philadelphia. He blasted Republican former President Donald Trump and called Harris ready to lead. But he also showcased his own accomplishments.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear took a similar approach over the weekend. He told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of \"a great president,\" and then highlighted the elections he has won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nHarris is said to also be considering Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, among others.\n\nSecret Service head, FBI's No. 2 grilled by Senate lawmakers\n\nThe acting director of the Secret Service said Tuesday he \"cannot defend\" why the roof used by the gunman in the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was not secured.\n\nRonald Rowe, testifying before two Senate committees, said that he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site where Trump had been holding a campaign rally, and that \"what I saw made me ashamed.\"\n\nRowe was joined at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official said a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nTrump plans rally at same Georgia venue as Harris event\n\nRepublican Donald Trump's campaign announced Tuesday, hours ahead of a rally planned by Vice President Kamala Harris at Georgia State University, that he will travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue.\n\nDemocrats say they have new hope for winning Georgia in November after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nTrump ad blasts Harris for problems at the border\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's campaign released a new advertisement Tuesday, blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for problems at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe advertisement dubs Harris the \"border czar,\" a reference to her work on migration issues. It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n\"Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,\" the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee \"fearless\" throughout her career.\n\n\"Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,\" said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n\"She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.\"\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, \"The Bachelorette,\" \"The Daily Show\" and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Georgia is a crucial swing state, and Harris's campaign is poised to make significant inroads as election approaches. Key Democratic figures have rallied behind Harris against Trump.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris made her first trip to Georgia as a presidential candidate, holding a rally on Tuesday with Grammy-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion. This rally comes in a state crucial for the November election, which Democrats see as up for grabs.\n\nWith less than 100 days left in this unpredictable campaign season, Democrats are re-evaluating their strategies in swing states. Harris held the event in Atlanta at 7:00 p.m. EDT, aimed at energizing voters.

He only cares about himself,\" said Harris, who pledged to revive a bipartisan border security bill that Senate Republicans blocked at Trump's urging.\n\n\"When I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem,\" she said.\n\nHer address capped a campaign rally that put Harris' stamp squarely on her run for president in a way that cleaved from President Joe Biden's style.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion praised the \"first Black female president\" during a set at Georgia State University's Convocation Center, while Quavo mentioned the shooting death of his Migos bandmate Takeoff as he reinforced his support for Harris' gun control policy.\n\nLater, Harris quoted a Quavo lyric to bash Trump before the approving crowd: \"He does not walk it like he talks it.\"\n\nThe thunderous reception - and the Harris-inspired lineup of speakers - underscored the changed political dynamic in Georgia since Biden quit his reelection bid. His withdrawal gave despondent Democrats new hope of recapturing the state, a hope underlined by recent polls showing a tightening race.\n\nThe changed dynamic triggered promises from Republicans to compete with renewed vigor.\n\nJust as Harris was preparing to arrive, Trump's campaign announced that the former president would hold a joint rally with U.S. Sen. JD Vance, his running mate, at the same Atlanta venue on Saturday.\n\nDuring Harris' visit, which included a stop at the iconic Paschal's Restaurant, the vice president was surrounded by vivid reminders of the party's successes and challenges in Georgia, where Democrats ended a drought of nearly three decades in 2020 when Biden narrowly captured the state.\n\nHarris was joined by U.S. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, whose triumphs in 2021 and 2022 helped Democrats flip and maintain control of the Senate. Both have pledged to use their political networks to help her carry the state again. Another in the entourage was Stacey Abrams, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee the past two midterm cycles, who fueled a wave of enthusiasm behind her quest for Georgia's top job but twice failed to turn that energy into electoral victories.\n\nAnd then there was former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who represents a tantalizing prospect for Trump's foes moving forward. Determined to beat the former president, Duncan said he's swallowing his concerns about Harris' agenda to endorse her.\n\nAbrams and the other Democrats were greeted with rapturous applause from a crowd packed with young voters. Plenty have \"discounted and dismissed\" the state, Abrams said, while voters here dreamed of a better future.\n\n\"We're not going back because we dream bigger - and we dream better,\" she said.\n\nOssoff and Warnock took the stage in tandem to pro-Harris chants. Ossoff mocked Trump for not committing to a debate against Harris, recalling his own bizarre Atlanta Press Club showdown against an empty podium when then-U.S. Sen. David Perdue refused to participate.\n\n\"Let me tell you,\" Ossoff said with a smile, \"a candidate dodging a debate is a candidate who is losing.\"\n\nIt's a theme Harris echoed in her own remarks: \"Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider, to meet me on the debate stage,\" Harris said. \"Because as the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face.\"\n\nWarnock reminded the crowd how Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" exactly enough votes to overturn Biden's victory in 2020.\n\n\"I want you to think about that. Georgia, Donald Trump tried to steal your vote. Kamala Harris is trying to earn your vote.\"\n\nHe also laid out a vision of a Harris administration that built upon Biden's agenda. He singled out federal voting rights protections, support for abortion rights and expanded health care access.\n\n\"Georgia, you saved the nation one time,\" he said to rising applause. \"And I've got a feeling Georgia is going to save the nation another time.\"\n\nNational Republicans mocked Harris' appearance as a grab for attention. Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley called it \"nothing but a performance\" to distract from the White House's immigration policy.\n\n\"A vote for dangerously pro-criminal Kamala is a vote for another four years of soft-on-crime and open-border policies that are making our communities around the country less safe,\" he said. Closer to home, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr took aim at Harris in a different way. \"She is a San Francisco leftist who was put in charge of two things: concealing President Biden's health issues and fixing the border,\" Carr said. \"The results of both have been disastrous for America.\"\n\nAnd a few dozen protesters gathered outside the arena, including a group from Cherokee County that chanted \"Georgia! Red! USA!\" as attendees entered the venue.\n\nThe GOP attacks did little to blunt enthusiasm. Lines stretched for blocks hours before Harris arrived. The RSVP list swelled up even before the hip-hop stars announced their plans to perform.\n\nStacey Livingston from Coweta County was among a group of Harris supporters who held up a banner outside the arena that stated: \"Herstory in the making. I drove all the way up here to let everybody know: we won't go back.\"\n\n_____\n\n(Atlanta Journal-Constitution staffwriters Riley Bunch and Vanessa McCray contributed to this article.)\n\n_____",

Nikema Williams, chair of the Democratic party of Georgia, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Greg Bluestein.\n\nFour hours before the expected start of Harris' 7:00 p.m. ET speech, the line for entry stretched down far down the city block outside the university's Convocation Center, which has an official capacity of more than 7,500.\n\nIn a display of Harris' bipartisan appeal, former Georgia Lieutenant Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican, is expected to attend. Georgia Democratic lawmakers like Williams and U.S. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock will also be there, along with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.\n\nIn the week since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race against former President Donald Trump, Harris has enjoyed a surge of grassroots momentum and high-dollar donations.\n\nThe wave of support potentially puts swing states like Georgia back on the map for Democrats, after months of slipping support with Biden helming the ticket.\n\n\"You've heard us talk about the need to have the infrastructure across all the battlegrounds to win close elections, but it's clear the Vice President is energizing and mobilizing our base,\" Harris campaign battleground director Dan Kanninen said Monday on a call with reporters.\n\nOnce a deep red stronghold, Georgia has been in play for Democrats over the past few election cycles due to growing populations of Black and Latino voters that make up a major part of the party's base.\n\nBut polls showed Biden lagging with those same demographics this year, a trend that Harris' campaign is hoping its new presidential candidate can help reverse.\n\nSince Biden's exit, Harris has raised over $200 million, two-thirds of which came from new donors, according to the campaign. The campaign has also hugely boosted its volunteer force with 360,000 new volunteer sign-ups.\n\nThe Georgia event marks Harris' second official rally of her 2024 presidential campaign, though surrogates, including VP hopefuls, have stumped for her in thousands of events including roughly 2,300 over the weekend.\n\nHarris' first rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin drew a crowd of over 3,000 people, then the largest of any of the campaign's events this election cycle.\n\nWith just under 100 days until the November election and even less time until early voting kicks off, the campaign is hoping it can translate the wave of initial Harris hype into real swing-state wins.\n\nPolls have so far found that Harris has revived the race against Trump, closing the gap with voters and bringing the election back to a near dead-heat.\n\nDespite the honeymoon phase that has characterized Harris' first week as a 2024 presidential candidate, the campaign is not ignorant of the uphill battle ahead.\n\n\"We are the underdogs in this race,\" Kanninen said Monday. \"Our task now is to translate that enthusiasm into action.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally, featuring a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\n\"This campaign is about freedom,\" said Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who was there with his fellow Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. \"So the question is, do you want to be free? Or do you want to go back?\"\n\n\"When you show up, we win.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere, can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nMore from this section\n\nFix Support Apple Com/iPhone/Restore in 5 Minutes -

Polling data, while limited, shows Harris starting to close the gap on former President Donald Trump across national polling. In the key battleground state of Georgia, Harris is tied with Trump, according to a recent poll released by Bloomberg News and Morning Consult.\n\nOrganizers of Tuesday's rally, held at the Georgia State University Convocation Center in Atlanta, told The New York Times that around 10,000 people attended the event, which included a performance by rapper Megan Thee Stallion. According to the stadium's website, the Convocation Center has seating for up to 8,000 guests.\n\nEarly into her roughly 20-minute speech, Harris repeated her line about knowing Trump's \"type,\" from her days as a prosecutor, again highlighting the former president's plethora of legal challenges and 34 felony convictions in Manhattan. Her supporters were also heard chanting, \"Lock him up!\" a play on the \"Lock her up!\" chant that Trump supporters hurled at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's campaign on Tuesday for comment on Harris' rally.\n\nBelow are a few key takeaways from Harris' rally on Tuesday:\n\nHarris Again Challenges Trump to Debate\n\nThe vice president threw another jab at Trump for backing out of his agreement to participate in the September 10 presidential debate that will be hosted by ABC News.\n\n\"So the momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it,\" Harris said from the podium.\n\n\"Last week, you may have seen, [Trump] pulled out of the debate in September that he previously agreed to,\" Harris continued. \"Here's the funny thing about that. He won't debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me.\"\n\n\"Well, Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,\" she added. \"Because as the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face.\"\n\nTrump originally accepted ABC News' invitation to debate while President Joe Biden was still in the race as the Democrats' presumptive nominee. Since Harris announced her campaign, however, the former president has come up with several reasons why he no longer wants to participate, including saying that he thinks the network will not be impartial while moderating.\n\nHarris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa released a statement Monday evening, saying Trump was \"dodging\" questions about participating in the September 10 debate because \"he's scared he'll have to defend his running mate's weird attacks on women, or his own calls to end elections in America in a debate against the vice president.\" Trump picked Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate.\n\nStar Power Shows Up for Harris in Georgia\n\nHarris continued to build on her campaign's momentum by inviting Stallion, a Grammy Award-winning artist, to perform at Tuesday's rally before the vice president addressed supporters. Harris has been backed by a long list of celebrities since entering the 2024 race.\n\nRapper and Atlanta native Quavo also spoke before Harris took the stage and encouraged supporters to get out and vote. He also talked about his experience fighting to tackle gun violence with the Biden administration. His nephew Takeoff, former member of the Migos group that Quavo heads, was fatally shot in 2022.\n\n\"What's only right in the birthplace of the culture is also the same place to launch the first African American woman to run for president,\" Quavo said to a cheering crowd Tuesday.\n\nHarris was also joined by Georgia Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, both Democrats.\n\nStallion and Quavo's appearances underscore the Democratic Party's shift since Harris launched her campaign. The vice president's embrace of public figures and online trends is likely an effort to garner Gen Z voters' support in November.\n\nHarris Defends Her Record on Immigration\n\nThe vice president also took on Trump's attacks regarding her record on immigration and promised to sign the bipartisan border security bill into law that was struck down in the Senate in the spring.\n\n\"Donald Trump has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk,\" Harris said Tuesday.\n\n\"Our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades,\" she continued. \"Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the bill ... It was all set to pass, but at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down.\n\n\"He tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election. Which goes to show, Donald Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself.\"\n\nAfter the border bill -- drafted by GOP Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut -- was presented to lawmakers in February, Trump described it as \"a great gift to the Democrats, and a Death Wish for The Republican Party\" in a post to his Truth Social account. Republicans have denied that the border bill was struck down by lawmakers due to Trump's criticism.\n\nTrump has also tried to capitalize on the immense pressure the Biden administration has faced over its handling of the U.S. southern border in his attacks on Harris, which he describes as the president's \"border czar.\" The vice president's campaign has responded by describing Trump's border policy as \"xenophobic.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlin_lewis@miamiherald.com", "name": "Kaitlin Lewis", "type":

And we are the underdogs in this race.\"\n\nHarris's nascent presidential bid took off following Biden's July 21 exit from the race, with much of the party coalescing behind her and her campaign raising a staggering $200 million.\n\n\"The momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it,\" she said.\n\nThe Republican nominee recently said he would forego political tradition and not debate Harris, and also unleashed a barrage of insults against his rival, calling her \"crazy\" and a \"bum.\"\n\n\"Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face,\" Harris said, to roars of approval.\n\nHarris also repeated her popular line about how, as a former prosecutor and California attorney general going up against predators and fraudsters, she knows \"Donald Trump's type.\"\n\n\"In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,\" she said.\n\n- 'Extreme abortion bans' -\n\nWith just 98 days before the election, Harris is under pressure to announce her vice presidential pick. Asked Tuesday whether she had chosen one, Harris told reporters: \"Not yet.\"\n\nThe search must be nearing a conclusion, however, as her team announced Tuesday that Harris and her new running mate would campaign next week in battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nWith the White House race turned on its head, 59-year-old Harris on Tuesday unveiled her first television ad since replacing Biden, while the Trump camp released a dueling spot attacking her on the crucial election issue of immigration.\n\nMore from this section With no Zipper at Queen City Ex this year, former operator shares stories of working the ride 'Hezbollah-Lebanon All Out War': India Issues Travel Advisory For Lebanon Amid Spiralling Situation Rajinder Nagar Rau IAS Coaching Incident: Police Detains the Protesting Students | Watch Videos\n\nHarris swatted away the attack, saying in her speech that while the Biden administration worked with conservatives to craft critical border legislation, Trump \"tanked\" it for political gain.\n\n\"Donald Trump does not care about border security,\" she said. \"He only cares about himself.\"\n\nHarris said if elected she would focus on key economic goals such as expanding affordable health care and tackling rising consumer costs.\n\nShe also attacked Trump, 78, over his \"extreme abortion bans,\" referring to restrictive new laws enacted in several states in the two years since the US Supreme Court -- featuring three justices nominated by Trump -- stripped constitutional protections for abortion.\n\n- Georgia in play -\n\nAs for Georgia's potential competitiveness, Harris insisted \"the path to the White House runs right through this state.\"\n\nIn a sign the southern state will be bitterly contested, Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance announced they would hold their own rally Saturday in Atlanta.\n\n\"Kamala Harris and her complicit cronies have made the great people of Georgia pay a hefty price for their woke policies,\" the Trump campaign said Tuesday.\n\nHarris took over a bleak electoral map from the faltering Biden, with Democrats' hopes entirely based on the three Rust Belt post-industrial states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut they are now looking again at other \"sunbelt\" states such as Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, all of which Democrats narrowly won in 2020.\n\nVance addressed a rally Tuesday in Henderson, Nevada, where he attacked Harris as \"dangerously liberal,\" while Trump campaigns in Pennsylvania on Wednesday.\n\nAdding some Atlanta glitz for younger voters was Megan Thee Stallion, the hip-hop star who performed before Harris took the stage.\n\ndk-mlm/aha", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elijah_nouvelage@reformer.com", "name": "Elijah Nouvelage", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

And minutes before Harris arrived, her campaign told Fox News that there were over 10,000 people filling the packed venue.\n\nThe rally, which featured a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, appears to be another sign of the energy and excitement that's returning to the party nine days after President Biden's blockbuster announcement that he was suspending his re-election campaign against former President Trump and endorsing his vice president.\n\n\"We have a fight in front of us,\" the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee said to cheers from the boisterous crowd. \"The momentum in this race is shifting. And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\n1 OF THESE 5 DEMOCRATS COULD BE HARRIS' RUNNING MATE\n\nBiden's immediate backing of Harris a week and a half ago ignited a surge of endorsements for the vice president by Democrat governors, senators, House members and other party leaders and elders. Within 36 hours, Harris announced that she had locked up her party's nomination by landing the verbal backing of a majority of the nearly 4,000 convention delegates.\n\n2024 AD WARS: TRUMP, HARRIS RACE TO DEFINE VICE PRESIDENT\n\nHarris, near the top of her 18-minute speech, took aim at Trump over the issue of border security, which many Republicans see as the vice president's political achilles heel.\n\n\"In this campaign I will proudly put my record against his,\" Harris said, before highlighting her border security efforts as California attorney general.\n\nHarris argued that Trump \"has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.\"\n\nShe pointed to a border security bill with some bipartisan support that was making its way through Congress earlier this year before Republicans turned against the measure after prompting from Trump.\n\n\"It was all set to pass, but at the last minute Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down,\" Harris said.\n\nShe charged that the former president \"tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election\" and pledged that \"as the president I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed.\"\n\nTrump, his campaign, and allied groups, have repeatedly criticized Harris in the past week over the surge of migrants across the nation's southern border during the Biden administration.\n\nHarris was tasked by Biden in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the \"root causes\" of migration in Central American countries. It led to her being dubbed the \"border czar\" both by the media and Republican opponents, although the White House has rejected that description.\n\nThe Trump campaign took to social media to respond.\n\n\"Kamala is actually *BRAGGING* about her record on immigration. HERE ARE THE FACTS: As Border Czar, Kamala ferried 15+ million illegals directly into our communities. She thinks illegal immigration \"is NOT a crime.\" She wants to abolish ICE. She thinks you're stupid,\" the Trump campaign claimed.\n\nHours earlier, the Trump campaign - in its first major ad blitz of the general election - charged that Harris had \"failed us\" in securing the border.\n\nHarris, in her speech, criticized the former president for not agreeing to debate her.\n\n\"He won't debate but he and his running mate sure have a lot to say about me,\" she said, as she pointed to Trump and Sen. JD Vance's attacks on her in recent days.\n\nTo cheers from the crowd, Harris emphasized \"if you have something to say, say it to my face.\"\n\nThe stop by Harris is a key test of the Democrats' momentum on the ground in the key southeastern battleground state where Biden narrowly edged Trump four years ago.\n\nOnce a red bastion, Georgia has become extremely competitive in presidential, Senate and gubernatorial elections in recent cycles, thanks in large part to the growing strength of Black and Latino voters, who make up a key party of the Democrats' base in the state.\n\nHOW LONG WILL THE HARRIS 'HONEYMOON' IN THE POLLS LAST?\n\nBut Biden's disastrous performance against Trump at a late June debate that was held in Atlanta fueled questions about his physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House.\n\nIt also spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the 81-year-old president to end his bid for a second term in the White House.\n\nTrump's edge over Biden in the key battleground states, including Georgia, started to grow in public opinion polling in the wake of the debate.\n\nThe former president is intent on winning Georgia in November.\n\nAnd hours before Harris arrived in Atlanta, the Trump campaign announced that the former president and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, will hold a rally on Saturday at the Georgia State Convocation Center, where Harris held her event.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump will likely also fill the venue as the former president has been drawing large crowds at his rallies since launching his 2024 campaign over a year and a half ago.\n\nThe Harris campaign, ahead of the Atlanta rally, highlighted the campaign's large ground game advantage over Trump's campaign in the swing states.\n\nBattleground states director Dan Kanninen noted that the campaign has 24 coordinated offices in Georgia, far ahead of the Trump campaign, which opened its first office in June.\n\n\"This battleground advantage will almost certainly be decisive in a race likely to be decided by just tens of thousands of votes,\" Kanninen said.\n\nThe vice president, ahead of the rally, met with local abortion rights activists in another sign of how she plans to showcase the issue as a central part of her White House campaign.", "source": {"uri": "1010wcsi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "1010 WCSI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Together we will do the work of Kamala Harris. Together we will get it done.\"\n\nAlong with Abrams, Georgia Congresswoman Nikema Williams (District 5), Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, and Senators Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock took the stage to pump up the crowd before Harris made her first appearance in Atlanta as a presidential candidate. \"Georgia, are you ready to make history again?,\" Dickens asked the crowd. \"Then let's elect Kamala Harris.\"\n\nOssoff, who took the stage alongside Warnock, said Trump was \"too scared\" to debate Harris and Warnock added that Georgia saved the nation during the last election and \"I have a feeling, Georgia, you're going to save the nation once again. Everybody knows the road to the White House goes through Georgia.\"\n\nGrammy-winning artists Meg the Stallion and Quavo joined the celebration. Meg the Stallion performed a number of her hit sings before Harris took the stage at 7 p.m. She said, \"Let's get this done, Atlanta\" in between songs. \"We're about to make history, Atlanta.\"\n\nKamala Harris immediately went into being clear that the road to the White House goes through the state of Georgia. She also repeated her popular line of \"knowing Donald Trump's type.\"\n\n\"I will proudly put my record against his any day,\" said Harris.\n\nDuring her speech she touched on abortion, building up the middle class, working on being able to bring down the prices of housing and childcare, the dangers of Project 2025, and providing border control. All of the hot topics this election season.\n\n\"Donald Trump doesn't care about border security,\" she said. \"He only cares about himself. When I am president I'm going to work to solve the problem.\"\n\nThe Georgia State University Convocation Center has 8,000 seats in it and on Tuesday night nearly all of them were full of supporters by the time Harris took the stage.\n\n\"Generations before us led the fight for freedom and now the baton is on our hands,\" Harris said. \"The momentum in this race is shifting and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nSupporters from all over metro Atlanta filled the arena seats and what would normally be the playing floor for the Georgia State University Panthers basketball and volleyball teams. People like Frank Turpin who said he braved the weather and ling lines to be inside the arena to see and hear Harris.\n\n\"I didn't know her candidacy would be like this,\" said Turpin, who added he wasn't excited about a Biden/Trump rematch before everything changed \"This is the best thing [they] could done.\"\n\nLinda Jordan, a democratic voter and Harris supporter said she feels connected to the vice president in many ways past them both being women of color.\n\n\"I think she is about community, I think she's about the future and not the past,\" said Jordan. \"I'm here to support her. It feels like she's bringing hope to America.\"\n\nTuesday was Harris' sixth visit to metro Atlanta this year, 15th overall since she became vice president in 2020, and her first visit to the Convocation Center. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a serious candidate to become Harris' vice president, was in Forsyth County on Sunday to stump for the vice president.\n\nKim Amis, a first time political campaign volunteer, walked around helping people find their seats and sharing campaign information. Amis, a democrat, said she got involved in the campaign because of Harris.\n\n\"This right here,\" she said as she pointed to the large crowd, \"I thought I'd never see this. When she stepped forward it was like electricity.\"\n\nHarris, along with United States President Joseph R. Biden, are scheduled to be in Houston for the funeral of Congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee later this week. Former President Donald J. Trump is scheduled to meet with journalists during the first day of the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago on Wednesday. According to the organization's website, Harris has also been invited to the conference.\n\nBefore she was done with her speech Harris said she hoped Trump would reconsider debating her before Election Day. There are only 98 days till November 5.\n\n\"Georgia, today I ask you, are you ready to get to work?, said Harris.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantavoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlanta

She called out Trump for \"pulling out\" of the debate in November after Trump said he would \"probably\" debate Harris at the previously agreed upon debate in September, The Hill reported.\n\nSharing a short video of her remarks in a rally in Georgia on X, Harris stated, \"Well, Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage because as the saying goes, \"If you've got something to say, say it to my face. She made the remarks amid cheers from the crowd in the rally.\n\nKamala Harris said, \"The momentum in this race is shifting and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it -- you may have noticed.\"\n\nHarris visited Atlanta as she tries to build on a wave of enthusiasm, witnessed through fundraising and volunteer signups since she announced her intention to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, The Hill reported. She highlighted her focus on Georgia, where US President Joe Biden secured a win in 2020 by fewer than 12,000 votes.\n\nHighlighting the importance of Georgia in the US presidential elections, she said, \"The path to the White House runs right through this state and you all helped us win in 2020, and we're going to do it again in 2024. Yes, we will.\"\n\nKamala Harris pledged to get the bipartisan immigration legislation that was negotiated in the Senate signed into law if she is elected.\n\nShe said, \"In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week.\" Harris stated that as attorney general of California, she went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers.\n\n\"I prosecuted them in case after case and I won. Donald Trump, Donald Trump on the other hand has been talking a big game about securing our border but he does not walk the walk or, as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it,\" Kamala said, quoting the American rapper Quavo, who addressed the crowd before her at the rally, The Hill reported.\n\nShe said that Republicans in the Senate did not allow the passage of the bill twice after Trump urged Republican lawmakers to oppose the legislation, suggesting it could give Biden an election-year win.\n\nHarris said, \"Which goes to show, Donald Trump does not care about border security, he only cares about himself.\" She stated, \"When I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem.\"\n\nShe vowed to bring back the border security bill if she gets elected as the US president. She said, \"As President I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Harris campaign shared a new video on the border, slamming Trump after his campaign debuted an ad tagging Harris as the Biden administration's \"border czar,\" a reference to her work addressing root causes of migration in the Northern Triangle region.\n\nWhile addressing the crowd in Atlanta, Harris said that \"prices are still too high\" and spoke on what she would do to lower them, saying that \"on Day One,\" she would implement policies like reducing price gouging, capping \"unfair\" rent rises, placing a ban on more hidden fees, and capping prices of prescription drug for all Americans.\n\nIn addition, she said that as president, she would pass voting rights bills, including the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Georgia has remained a centre of controversial election policies since Governor Brian Kemp (R) passed a law in 2021 that bans the distribution of food or water to voters waiting to vote, among other restrictions.\n\nTwo popular rappers, Quavo and Megan Thee Stallion, made remarks at the rally before Harris and called on the crowd to show up in November. Grammy award-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion performed a medley of some of her top songs, according to The Hill report.\n\nQuavo stated that he had previously worked with Harris to address gun violence. He further said, \"One thing I learned about working with vice president is she always stands on business.\" (ANI)", "source": {"uri": "aninews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asian News

But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally, featuring a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere, can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType":

It seems like the Hot Girl coach herself, Megan Thee Stallion, will be joining Vice President Kamala Harris today in Atlanta at her rally for a special performance.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion is now added to the long list of celebrities who have endorsed Harris. She has received endorsements from Cardi B, Lizzo, Will Packer, Lil Nas X, John Legend, and many more. Although we have not seen an official endorsement, singer Beyonc\u00e9 has allowed Harris and her campaign to use her song \"Freedom\" as the official campaign song. This past weekend, Harris linked up with *NSYNC member Lance Bass for a TikTok collaboration, throwing a little shade at Donald Trump as the upcoming November election approaches. \"Hey Kamala, what are we gonna say to Donald Trump in November?\" Bass asks Harris. \"Bye, bye, bye,\" Harris responds, referencing the group's 2000 hit song from their third album, No Strings Attached.\n\nSince announcing her run for president, Harris has received an outpouring of support, especially from HBCUs. Delaware State University's president, Dr. Tony Allen, wrote a letter to the Biden administration thanking them for what they have done for HBCUs. Dr. Allen mentions Harris in the letter, noting that the work she has done has not gone unnoticed. Students at Texas Southern University told a local news outlet how excited they were about Harris's campaign to become the first female president. If Harris wins the election in November, she will also be the first president to graduate from an HBCU.\n\nBoth Harris and Megan Thee Stallion attended HBCUs. Harris graduated from Howard University in 1986 with a degree in political science and economics. There, she became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. Harris was also captain of the debate team and interned for former California senator Alan Cranston.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion briefly attended Prairie View A&M University before transferring to Texas Southern University. It was during her time at PVAMU that she began uploading videos of herself freestyling on social media, gaining popularity. She also danced as a Panther Doll during her time at PVAMU. Megan Thee Stallion graduated from Texas Southern University in December 2021 with a degree in health administration.\n\nThe rally will take place at the Georgia State University Convocation Center in Atlanta, Georgia. The event begins at 7 p.m. and Megan Thee Stallion will perform at 7:30 p.m. Georgia Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will also be in attendance.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com",

The rapper confirmed on Instagram she would be at the event. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, Mayor Andre Dickens, Rep. Nikema Williams and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will also join Harris, according to her campaign.\n\nHarris' campaign sees a win in Georgia, a battleground state, as one of her pathways to winning the 2024 election.\n\nMr. Biden very narrowly won the state against former President Donald Trump four years ago -- a rare victory in a state that hadn't backed a Democrat for president in nearly three decades. It was Mr. Biden's disastrous debate performance in Atlanta against Trump in June that ultimately led to the end of his reelection campaign.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her running mate by Aug. 7, the current deadline to obtain ballot access in Ohio, which requires nominees be certified at least 90 days before Election Day. Ohio lawmakers changed the deadline to Sept. 1, but the new law doesn't take effect until then, prompting Democrats to formalize their nominee before the convention in Chicago on Aug. 19 out of an abundance of caution.\n\nHarris said earlier Tuesday she has \"not yet\" made a decision about her running mate.\n\nHarris and the yet-to-be-named vice presidential candidate will campaign together in battleground states next week, sources familiar with the plans told CBS News.\n\nTrump and his running mate, Sen.

Initial reaction from swing states\n\nPrior to Harris taking the podium, a number of prominent Democrats in Georgia addressed the crowd of over 10,000.\n\nFormer Rep. Stacey Abrams, Mayor Andre Dickens, Rep. Nikema Williams, and Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock took turns speaking to the hyped up crowd.\n\nWhen Abrams hit the stage, she received a standing ovation. As the crowd chanted \"Stacey, Stacey, Stacey,\" she redirected them by shouting \"Kamala, Kamala, Kamala.\"\n\nBoth Warnock and Ossoff took turns taking jabs at Trump, saying he was \"too scared to debate Vice President Harris,\" and claiming that he \"tried to steal your vote. Kamala is trying to earn your vote.\"\n\nHouston rapper Megan Thee Stallion called on her \"Hotties for Harris\" to sing along as she performed multiple songs ahead of Harris' speech.\n\n\"Now I know my ladies in the crowd love their bodies,\" the 'Body' rapper said onstage. \"And if you want to keep loving your body, you know who to vote for.\"\n\nMigos rapper Quavo, a Grammy-nominated artist and philanthropist, spoke briefly. He and Harris have notably been working together to help curb gun violence following the death of his nephew, fellow Migos rapper Takeoff.\n\nQuavo introduced Morehouse College graduate Tyler Greene, who touted Harris' investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities ahead of his introducing her.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spoke for a little over 20 minutes, focusing on her political record as a prosecutor, district attorney and the attorney general of California.\n\n\"In those roles I took on perpetrators of all kinds, predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain,\" she told the crowd. \"So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type.\"\n\nShe also toyed with the idea of debating Trump one day, pointing out that he pulled out of his previously agreed to September debate against Biden after the current president announced he would be dropping out of the race.\n\n\"Here's the funny thing about that: So, he won't debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me,\" she laughed. \"And, by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird? Well, Donald? I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage because as the saying goes, 'If you've got something to say, say it to my face.'\"\n\nThis was Harris' first visit to the Peach State since President Joe Biden bowed out of the 2024 race. She has visited Georgia about a half-dozen times this year, making it her 15th visit since becoming vice president.\n\nHarris has seen momentum in her presidential bid and appears to have energized both her base and left-leaning independents. She is hoping to keep Georgia in play for the presidential election in November.\n\nSEE ALSO: Are Democrats gaining an edge by calling Trump and Vance 'weird'?\n\nIn addition, she is hoping to sway Republicans who do not openly support former President Donald Trump. Last week, former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan threw his support behind Harris, citing Trump's incitement of the Jan. 5 riot at the Capitol. She is hoping to win over GOP voters who supported Nikki Haley during the primary elections.\n\nHarris is also hoping to flip the age-related narrative that was used against Biden onto Trump, who is now the oldest presidential candidate at 77.\n\nHarris's rally comes days before an announced rally for her Republican opponents, President Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance.", "source":

But now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map.\n\nIn the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris pulled off what has been a signature Trump event: A big, loud rally full of supporters cheering her name, as she mocked her rival and his running mate JD Vance as \"just plain weird,\" and derided their policies as backward, outdated and dangerous.\n\nHarris mentioned Trump's efforts to stop the passage of an immigration bill that had bipartisan support and would have been among the strongest border security in decades. She said she'd work to push the bill across the finish line. \"I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed and I will sign it and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.\"\n\nTrump earlier said he'd debate Harris, but is now questioning the value of a meetup and saying he \"probably\" will debate her, but he \"can also make a case for not doing it.\"\n\nHarris seized on it. \"So he won't debate me, but he and his running mate have a lot to say about me,\" she said. \"And by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird.\"\n\n\"Well Donald,\" she said, addressing him head-on. \"I do hope you'll reconsider. Meet me on the debate stage ... because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\" Trump has suggested the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to a different network, calling ABC \"fake news.\"\n\nThe roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and a performance by Megan Thee Stallion. Such an atmosphere would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities and ultimately ended his campaign.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris' campaign argues her appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nHarris began Tuesday with her days as a prosecutor -- setting up the contrast between the law and Trump's many legal problems and misdeeds. But she also aggressively defended the Biden administration's record and she'd work to pass voting rights legislation and work to restore reproductive rights stripped by the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We're not going back,\" she said, shaking her head no as the crowd cheered \"we're not going back.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nSC lake hasn't allowed fishing since the 1950s.

It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nIn a call with supporters after her speech, Harris thanked them for their work and noted early voting starts in some states in just 38 days. She hasn't yet formally seized the nomination, nor picked a running mate; both are expected soon.\n\n\"This is a sprint,\" she said. \"And we know what we need to do to cross the finish line.\"\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\nLong reported from Washington.

Dan Kanninen, the Harris campaign's battleground-states director, told reporters on Monday that the state is still \"in play,\" which could explain why Harris has visited it 15 times since becoming vice-president.\n\nIn addition to a performance from Megan, Harris is expected to be supported by Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock along with former representative Stacey Abrams, per ABC. Atlanta is notably home to historically Black institutions Morehouse College, Spelman College, and Clark Atlanta University, and Harris is also expected to meet with local reproductive-rights activists and leaders, according to Axios.\n\nMegan is only the latest celeb to throw her support behind Harris. Over the weekend, the Harris campaign posted a playful video of Lance Bass asking, \"Hey, Kamala, what are we gonna say to Donald Trump in November?,\" to which Harris responded, \"Bye, bye, bye,\" referring to 'N Sync's 2000 song.

She made the remarks amid cheers from the crowd in the rally.\n\nKamala Harris said, \"The momentum in this race is shifting and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it -- you may have noticed.\"\n\nHarris visited Atlanta as she tries to build on a wave of enthusiasm, witnessed through fundraising and volunteer signups since she announced her intention to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, The Hill reported. She highlighted her focus on Georgia, where US President Joe Biden secured a win in 2020 by fewer than 12,000 votes.\n\nHighlighting the importance of Georgia in the US presidential elections, she said, \"The path to the White House runs right through this state and you all helped us win in 2020, and we're going to do it again in 2024. Yes, we will.\"\n\nKamala Harris pledged to get the bipartisan immigration legislation that was negotiated in the Senate signed into law if she is elected.\n\nShe said, \"In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week.\" Harris stated that as attorney general of California, she went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers.\n\n\"I prosecuted them in case after case and I won. Donald Trump, Donald Trump on the other hand has been talking a big game about securing our border but he does not walk the walk or, as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it,\" Kamala said, quoting the American rapper Quavo, who addressed the crowd before her at the rally, The Hill reported.\n\nShe said that Republicans in the Senate did not allow the passage of the bill twice after Trump urged Republican lawmakers to oppose the legislation, suggesting it could give Biden an election-year win.\n\nHarris said, \"Which goes to show, Donald Trump does not care about border security, he only cares about himself.\" She stated, \"When I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem.\"\n\nShe vowed to bring back the border security bill if she gets elected as the US president. She said, \"As President I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.\"\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Harris campaign shared a new video on the border, slamming Trump after his campaign debuted an ad tagging Harris as the Biden administration's \"border czar,\" a reference to her work addressing root causes of migration in the Northern Triangle region.\n\nWhile addressing the crowd in Atlanta, Harris said that \"prices are still too high\" and spoke on what she would do to lower them, saying that \"on Day One,\" she would implement policies like reducing price gouging, capping \"unfair\" rent rises, placing a ban on more hidden fees, and capping prices of prescription drug for all Americans.\n\nIn addition, she said that as president, she would pass voting rights bills, including the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Georgia has remained a centre of controversial election policies since Governor Brian Kemp (R) passed a law in 2021 that bans the distribution of food or water to voters waiting to vote, among other restrictions.\n\nTwo popular rappers, Quavo and Megan Thee Stallion, made remarks at the rally before Harris and called on the crowd to show up in November. Grammy award-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion performed a medley of some of her top songs, according to The Hill report.\n\nQuavo stated that he had previously worked with Harris to address gun violence. He further said, \"One thing I learned about working with vice president is she always stands on business.\" (ANI)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"},

As she taunted Donald Trump for his indecision about participating in their upcoming debate, Harris declared, \"The momentum in this race is shifting. And there are signs Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nJust over a week ago, Georgia seemed to be slipping from the Democrats' grasp, with President Joe Biden's campaign focusing on securing the Midwestern \"blue wall\" states, potentially at the expense of the \"Sun Belt\" battlegrounds.However, Biden's abrupt exit from the race and Harris emerging as the likely nominee has rejuvenated Democratic hopes of broadening the electoral map.\n\nIn a state that handed Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris mirrored a classic Trump-style event: a raucous rally filled with supporters, who cheered her on as she criticized Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, labeling their policies as outdated and dangerous. \"I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed and I will sign it and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like,\" Harris proclaimed, referencing Trump's opposition to a bipartisan immigration bill.\n\nTrump, who had initially agreed to debate Harris, is now wavering, saying he \"probably\" will debate but can \"also make a case for not doing it.\" Harris seized on his indecision, challenging him directly, \"Meet me on the debate stage ... because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\" Trump has called for the debate, scheduled for September 10 on ABC News, to be moved to a different network, dismissing ABC as \"fake news.\"\n\nThe 8,000-capacity arena at Georgia State University was filled to the rafters with supporters waving signs, dancing to campaign music, and enjoying a performance by Megan Thee Stallion. This vibrant scene contrasted sharply with the uncertainty that surrounded the Democratic party just 10 days ago, as doubts about Biden's age and capabilities ultimately led to the end of his campaign.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris' campaign asserts that her appeal to young people, working-age women, and non-white voters has altered the dynamics in Georgia and similar states like North Carolina, Nevada, and Arizona. A strategy memo from Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, formerly Biden's campaign chair, emphasized the necessity of winning Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania but also highlighted the new opportunities Harris brings to attract Black, Latino, and young voters in states like Georgia.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nHarris began her day by highlighting her prosecutorial background, contrasting it with Trump's legal troubles, while vigorously defending the Biden administration's record. She pledged to pass voting rights legislation and restore reproductive rights lost after the fall of Roe v. Wade. \"America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back,\" she declared, to chants of \"we're not going back\" from the crowd.\n\nRepublicans argue that concerns over high consumer prices and immigration issues will impact Harris negatively in the traditionally conservative state. However, they acknowledge that the race now resembles the tightly contested 2020 more than it did a few weeks ago.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nIn response, Trump announced a rally in the same Georgia State arena for Saturday, underscoring the fierce competition ahead. Robinson admitted that while Harris has her weaknesses, including progressive stances from her 2020 primary campaign, she has been \"in command\" so far, making the race competitive in Georgia.\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden,\" arguing she must explain her support for policies that allegedly harmed Georgia families. Nonetheless, Harris' campaign and Georgia Democrats have mobilized significantly, with 24 offices across the state, including two new ones in metro Atlanta.\n\nHarris, addressing supporters post-speech, stressed the urgency of the campaign, noting that early voting begins in just 38 days. While she has yet to formally clinch the nomination or choose a running mate, these decisions are expected imminently.\n\n\"This is a sprint,\" she said. \"And we know what we need to do to cross the finish line.\"\n\nHarris' campaign strategy involves winning over voters in Atlanta's growing suburbs and exurbs, targeting moderates disenchanted with Trump. For many, her candidacy represents a fresh start.\n\n\"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" said Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite from Forsyth County. \"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, expressing disdain for Trump.\n\nAllen Smith, a 41-year-old Atlanta native, has become a first-time campaign volunteer for Harris. \"I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" he said, recounting his reaction to Biden's endorsement of Harris.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

On Monday, Trump told Fox News he wanted to debate but that he could also \"make a case for not doing it.\"\n\nHarris portrayed herself as the underdog in the race against Trump but said the \"momentum in this race is shifting and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nIt's Harris' first visit to Georgia since President Biden ended his reelection campaign. Her campaign is trying to keep the battleground state in play. Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, noted the importance of the state moments into her speech.\n\n\"I am very clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state,\" Harris said. \"You all helped us win in 2020 and we are going to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nMr. Biden very narrowly won the state against former President Donald Trump four years ago -- a rare victory in a state that hadn't backed a Democrat for president in nearly three decades. It was Mr. Biden's disastrous debate performance in Atlanta against Trump in June that ultimately led to his withdrawal from the race.\n\nHarris also laid out some priorities for her potential administration, including bringing back a bipartisan border bill that Trump lobbied Republican members of Congress to sink, taking on price gouging, and capping \"unfair rent increases\" and prescription drug costs.\n\nHer mention of the border security bill was aimed at blunting a criticism increasingly leveled at her by Republicans.\n\nBefore Harris took the stage, Grammy-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion, wearing a royal blue pantsuit, performed a handful of her hits, including \"Savage\" and \"Mamushi.\"\n\nSens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, Mayor Andre Dickens, Rep. Nikema Williams and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams also joined Harris at the event.\n\nMore than 10,000 people attended the event, according to the campaign, which said it was her largest rally to date.\n\nHarris is expected to pick her running mate by Monday, and a top tier of candidates has emerged, CBS News has learned. Harris said earlier Tuesday she has \"not yet\" made a decision about her running mate.\n\nHarris and the yet-to-be-named vice presidential candidate will campaign together in battleground states next week, sources familiar with the plans told CBS News.\n\nTrump and his running mate, Sen.

Georgia.\n\nHarris is making up for lost time on the campaign trail as Election Day is less than 100 days away.\n\nShe touched down in the key battleground state of Georgia and pulled out all the stops during her rally.\n\nHarris addressed the controversy surrounding her first debate with Donald Trump and was quick to blast him for backing out of the showdown.\n\n\"He won't debate - but funny enough he and his running mate sure have a lot to say about me,\" she said.\n\n\"If you've got something to say - say it to my face.\"\n\nHarris then challenged Trump to meet her on the debate stage before November 5.\n\nShe also made sure to call Trump and his running mate JD Vance \"weird.\"\n\nTrump was asked during an interview with Fox News on Monday night whether he would debate Harris.\n\n\"The answer is yes, I'll probably end up debating,\" he told Laura Ingraham.\n\nIngraham pressed Trump on why he wouldn't debate Harris and pointed out that Democrats speculated that he was scared to debate his challenger.\n\nHe said that he wouldn't debate Harris until she was the official Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump also used the opportunity to slam the Democrats for nominating Harris so close to the election.\n\nGeorgia is a key battleground state with 16 electoral votes.\n\nThe state consistently favored Republican candidates from 1972 to 2016.\n\nPresident Biden won by 0.2% over Donald Trump in 2020 and the state flipped blue by electing two Democratic senators.\n\nSenators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff narrowly won their elections and Warnock clinched the victory in a runoff race.\n\nBoth senators were in attendance for Harris' rally and expressed strong support for her presidential run.\n\nWarnock urged Georgians to vote for Harris, stating that \"the presidential race runs through Georgia.\"\n\nMegan Thee Stallion then took the stage in a blue pantsuit to perform a medley of her songs for the crowd.\n\nShe shouted out Harris and told the audience that they were making history.\n\nRapper Quavo also took the podium to endorse Harris.\n\nHe said that she, \"Stood on business,\" and expressed his desire to stop gun violence on the streets of Atlanta.\n\nEntrepreneur Tyler Greene introduced Harris to the stage.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_gable@the-sun.com",

The Houston hottie hit the stage and performed \"Girls in the Hood,\" \"Mamushi,\" \"Body,\" and \"Savage\" for the hyped crowd.\n\nMegan had been teasing her appearance at the rally for the last 24 hours. While she didn't initially reveal there would be a performance, Meg announced the news with a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, earlier today.\n\n\"Hotties I'm performing for THEE Kamala Harris today in Atlanta!!\" she tweeted.\n\nMegan showing support for Vice President Kamala Harris comes at a time when hip-hop has been fairly quiet about backing the current Democratic nominee for president. Democrats reportedly consider Georgia -- where Megan performed at the rally -- a state that is up for grabs in the November election.\n\nWhile Megan hasn't been the most vocal artist on politics throughout her career, it's evident she's making the time to assist Kamala Harris with getting the youth vote in her direction.\n\nWhen current President Joe Biden announced earlier this month that he was dropping out of the presidential election, Lil Nas X was the most popular rapper at the time to endorse Harris.\n\n\"Lock in lil bro! @KamalaHarris,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"Ur seat is ready madam president @KamalaHarris\" with a salute emoji.\n\nHowever, Quavo voiced his opinion about having Harris lead the U.S. as president today as well. At the rally, the former Migos member endorsed VP Harris for president in a speech. Last month, Quavo and Harris united in Atlanta for a discussion about gun violence prevention at the Rocket Foundation Summit. He also met with Harris at the White House last September to discuss putting an end to gun violence.\n\nThe Atlanta rapper launched the Rocket Foundation in 2022 to honor the late Takeoff, his rap mate and nephew. The foundation focuses on gun violence prevention and criminal violence intervention.\n\nPresident Joe Biden established the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention last year, which has been overseen by Kamala Harris.\n\nTake a look as the Hot Girl supports Vice President Kamala Harris with a performance at the Atlanta campaign rally below.", "source": {"uri": "xxlmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "XXL Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georgette_cline@xxlmag.com", "name": "Georgette Cline", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_in_the_Hood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Girls in the Hood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quavo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quavo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Nas_X", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lil Nas X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migos", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Migos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2024/07/attachment-Megan-Thee-Stallion-Kamala-Rally.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774352", "eventUri": "eng-9774352", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 159, "textEnd": 166}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Vance.\n\n\"And by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird?\"\n\nThere are less than 100 days to go in one of the least predictable election seasons in recent memory.\n\nSince Biden ended his reelection bid just over a week ago, Harris has significantly outperformed him in recent polling among young people, Black voters and Hispanic voters.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday showed Harris with a one point lead over Trump, down from two points a week earlier.\n\nShe was joined in Atlanta by rappers Quavo and Megan Thee Stallion, who performed before Harris' speech.\n\nHarris pledged Democrats would win Georgia, a swing state the party had written off which could play a decisive role in November.\n\nShe also taunted Trump for backing out of a debate with her.\n\n\"Well, Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because, as the saying goes, 'if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\"\n\nHarris also appeared to embrace some Biden policy priorities- vowing to bring down prices on day one of her presidency.\n\nShe said she would ban more hidden banking fees, take on corporate landlords and \"cap unfair rent increases.\"\n\nAfter her speech, Harris appeared on a Zoom call with supporters, telling them \"this is a sprint\" and asking them to volunteer.\n\nHer quickly-assembled campaign has raised $200 million since Biden dropped out, and signed up 170,000 new volunteers.\n\nSources say Harris will reveal her new vice presidential nominee at a rally on

Harris is putting it back on the map.", "body": "ATLANTA -- When Joe Biden last left this city after his abysmal debate performance, Democrats felt hopeless about their chances in Georgia -- and just about everywhere else.\n\nKamala Harris's Tuesday rally at the Georgia State Convocation Center -- a boisterous affair that included line dancing, a \"hotties for Harris\" banner and a performance by rapper Megan Thee Stallion -- left them optimistic, but still far from certain about both.\n\nThe vice president's appeal to voters of color and younger voters, combined with a recent pivot to the center that could persuade suburbanites and a general new-candidate shine, has created an opening in Georgia and other Sun Belt states that seemed unlikely for Biden, whose electoral hopes had narrowed north to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nHarris, struggling to speak over the applause of a crowd her campaign pegged at 10,000, made clear she sees Georgia as key to November victory. And she for the first time mapped out some of her policy priorities -- on immigration, voting rights and gun control -- that Atlantans in interviews this week said they had been eagerly awaiting.\n\n\"I am very clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state,\" Harris said. \"You all helped us win in 2020, and we're going to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nShe also challenged former President Donald Trump to \"meet me on the debate stage\" after he said in an interview with Fox News Channel that ran Monday night that he would \"probably\" debate her -- but \"can also make a case for not doing it.\"\n\n\"As the saying goes: If you got something to say, say it to my face,\" she said to a round of applause from the crowd, which was gathered less than two miles from the TV studio where last month's Biden-Trump debate was held.\n\nHarris' late entry comes after Trump, who lost Georgia by only 11,779 votes in 2020, has made inroads among Black voters, especially younger Black men. But strategists from both parties see a potential for the new Democratic nominee to halt or reverse those trends.\n\n\"It feels like Georgia's re-entered the chat,\" said Stephen Lawson, a veteran GOP strategist here. \"Georgia was not in play for Joe Biden. Georgia is in play for Kamala Harris.\"\n\n\"President Trump has the slight edge, but I think the vice president has quickly cut into that,\" he added.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen voters in downtown Atlanta ahead of Harris' Tuesday rally revealed excitement -- but also doses of uncertainty -- about her candidacy and what she would do if elected president. They suggest that coconut tree memes, brat summer, and the goodwill of Democrats eager for a candidate under the age of 80 -- while helpful in buoying the nascent campaign's fundraising efforts -- will only go so far, and that voters are interested in seeing her policy roadmap and her vice presidential pick before fully committing to her.\n\n\"I want to see what she has to say,\" said ShaDonna Bell, 27, sitting on a park bench in downtown Atlanta. She added that she likes Harris, but the vice president \"still has to earn the vote.\"\n\nTrump has made a significant play for Black voters -- and specifically Black men -- this cycle, with a recent national poll from The New York Times/Siena College showing that while Harris is doing better with voters of color than Biden has all year, Trump continues to outperform his 2020 numbers with them. Trump is set to attend the National Association of Black Journalists' convention in Chicago on Wednesday, and Trump and Vance will be in Georgia on Saturday at the same venue Harris hosted her Tuesday rally.\n\nStill, strategists from both parties questioned whether Trump's support with Black voters is as durable as suggested by polling, which shows him climbing into the upper teens or low 20s after earning only single-digit support in his two previous elections.\n\n\"That's been hard to believe, if I'm being honest. But I wouldn't completely discount it,\" said Howard Franklin, a prominent Black Democratic strategist in Atlanta. \"I think there is an appeal.\"\n\nIn interviews here, some Black voters expressed skepticism about what the Democratic Party has done to support them.\n\n\"What has she done?\" said Kwai Johnson, 56, who voiced concerns about Harris' background as San Francisco district attorney and California state attorney general and said he doesn't feel like she has helped the Black community. \"Really no one has, so I'm not going to hold that against her. I'm just going to hold what she does, and what she did, not what she might do.\"\n\nKwai, who is an assistant engineer at an electronics company, said he's undecided in the election but is leaning toward not voting in the presidential race or voting for a third-party candidate. As a Clinton voter in 2016 and a Biden voter in 2020, he's just the kind of person the Harris campaign thinks it can win back with her at the top of the ticket.\n\nIn a memo last week, campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said that the Biden-Harris swap \"opens up additional persuadable voters who our campaign can work to win the support of,\" like the undecided segment, which are \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" and \"are more likely to have supported the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020.\"\n\nDemocrats here argue Biden always had a shot in Georgia, pointing to the significant investment the campaign has made as proof of its seriousness. The campaign Harris has now inherited has 24 field offices and more than 170 coordinated staff, with 2,500 volunteers participating in more than 174 events across the state last weekend.\n\n\"The groundwork was laid early on this year, and the Democrats treated this like a state that they wanted to compete in,\" said Dave Hoffman, spokesperson for the state Democratic Party. \"Georgia's in play. I believed that Georgia was in play prior to all of this.\"\n\nBut her supporters acknowledge the investment Harris has personally made in Georgia, visiting the state now 15 times as vice president.\n\n\"My friends who are not political ... are also super engaged at this point,\" said Franklin, the Democratic strategist in Atlanta. \"Some of that credit belongs to the vice president for having built those inroads or having hosted those house parties or having cultivated relationships. There's definitely a broader phalanx, or constellation, of people who are interested in the outcome.\"\n\nAnd Harris' emergence is energizing younger voters. Ari Adams, 24, said that her Gen-Z friends are now registering to vote and planning to support Harris in November -- and Adams, who had already planned to vote for Biden and has now switched to Harris, said she's thinking about volunteering for Harris' campaign.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of Gen Zs on TikTok saying they registered to vote and are excited to vote. A lot of people my age that weren't going to vote at first are ready to vote,\" Adams said. \"Now with Kamala I'm like, 'Yes, y'all, you got to get out and vote.' I'm so excited to see all the women rallying behind her in all the different Zoom calls -- even the men doing the different Zoom calls and raising money.\"\n\nRepublican strategists admit that Harris' entrance has shaken up the race in Georgia in a way they hadn't thought possible two weeks ago. Shortly after Biden dropped out of the race, Brian Robinson, a longtime GOP strategist in the state, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that swapping in Harris \"will not change the dynamic,\" saying her \"approval numbers are as bad as Biden's.\"\n\nBut in an interview with POLITICO this week, Robinson admitted he was \"somewhat wrong.\" He said she was \"fantastic\" at her first campaign rally in Milwaukee last week, she was \"serious and statesman-like\" in her meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and that she has \"obviously energized and united the party in a way that is fairly remarkable.\"\n\n\"Fourteen days ago, Trump had just been shot, and this thing was over,\" Robinson said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Polling data, while limited, shows Harris starting to close the gap on former President Donald Trump across national polling. In the key battleground state of Georgia, Harris is tied with Trump, according to a recent poll released by Bloomberg News and Morning Consult.\n\nOrganizers of Tuesday's rally, held at the Georgia State University Convocation Center in Atlanta, told The New York Times that around 10,000 people attended the event, which included a performance by rapper Megan Thee Stallion. According to the stadium's website, the Convocation Center has seating for up to 8,000 guests.\n\nEarly into her roughly 20-minute speech, Harris repeated her line about knowing Trump's \"type,\" from her days as a prosecutor, again highlighting the former president's plethora of legal challenges and 34 felony convictions in Manhattan. Her supporters were also heard chanting, \"Lock him up!\" a play on the \"Lock her up!\" chant that Trump supporters hurled at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's campaign on Tuesday for comment on Harris' rally.\n\nBelow are a few key takeaways from Harris' rally on Tuesday:\n\nThe vice president threw another jab at Trump for backing out of his agreement to participate in the September 10 presidential debate that will be hosted by ABC News.\n\n\"So the momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it,\" Harris said from the podium.\n\n\"Last week, you may have seen, [Trump] pulled out of the debate in September that he previously agreed to,\" Harris continued. \"Here's the funny thing about that. He won't debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me.\"\n\n\"Well, Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,\" she added. \"Because as the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face.\"\n\nTrump originally accepted ABC News' invitation to debate while President Joe Biden was still in the race as the Democrats' presumptive nominee. Since Harris announced her campaign, however, the former president has come up with several reasons why he no longer wants to participate, including saying that he thinks the network will not be impartial while moderating.\n\nHarris campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa released a statement Monday evening, saying Trump was \"dodging\" questions about participating in the September 10 debate because \"he's scared he'll have to defend his running mate's weird attacks on women, or his own calls to end elections in America in a debate against the vice president.\" Trump picked Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate.\n\nHarris continued to build on her campaign's momentum by inviting Stallion, a Grammy Award-winning artist, to perform at Tuesday's rally before the vice president addressed supporters. Harris has been backed by a long list of celebrities since entering the 2024 race.\n\nRapper and Atlanta native Quavo also spoke before Harris took the stage and encouraged supporters to get out and vote. He also talked about his experience fighting to tackle gun violence with the Biden administration. His nephew Takeoff, former member of the Migos group that Quavo heads, was fatally shot in 2022.\n\n\"What's only right in the birthplace of the culture is also the same place to launch the first African American woman to run for president,\" Quavo said to a cheering crowd Tuesday.\n\nHarris was also joined by Georgia Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, both Democrats.\n\nStallion and Quavo's appearances underscore the Democratic Party's shift since Harris launched her campaign. The vice president's embrace of public figures and online trends is likely an effort to garner Gen Z voters' support in November.\n\nThe vice president also took on Trump's attacks regarding her record on immigration and promised to sign the bipartisan border security bill into law that was struck down in the Senate in the spring.\n\n\"Donald Trump has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk,\" Harris said Tuesday.\n\n\"Our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades,\" she continued. \"Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, D.C., supported the bill ... It was all set to pass, but at the last minute, Trump directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down.\n\n\"He tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election. Which goes to show, Donald Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself.\"\n\nAfter the border bill -- drafted by GOP Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut -- was presented to lawmakers in February, Trump described it as \"a great gift to the Democrats, and a Death Wish for The Republican Party\" in a post to his Truth Social account. Republicans have denied that the border bill was struck down by lawmakers due to Trump's criticism.\n\nTrump has also tried to capitalize on the immense pressure the Biden administration has faced over its handling of the U.S. southern border in his attacks on Harris, which he describes as the president's \"border czar.\" The vice president's campaign has responded by describing Trump's border policy as \"xenophobic.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlin_lewis@newsweek.com", "name": "Kaitlin Lewis", "type": "author",

Nikema Williams and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams will also join Harris, according to her campaign.\n\nHarris' campaign sees a win in Georgia, a battleground state, as one of her pathways to winning the 2024 election.\n\nMr. Biden very narrowly won the state against former President Donald Trump four years ago -- a rare victory in a state that hadn't backed a Democrat for president in nearly three decades. It was Mr. Biden's disastrous debate performance in Atlanta against Trump in June that ultimately led to the end of his reelection campaign.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her running mate by Aug. 7, the current deadline to obtain ballot access in Ohio, which requires nominees be certified at least 90 days before Election Day. Ohio lawmakers changed the deadline to Sept. 1, but the new law doesn't take effect until then, prompting Democrats to formalize their nominee before the convention in Chicago on Aug. 19 out of an abundance of caution.\n\nHarris said earlier Tuesday she has \"not yet\" made a decision about her running mate.\n\nHarris and the yet-to-be-named vice presidential candidate will campaign together in battleground states next week, sources familiar with the plans told CBS News.\n\nTrump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, are scheduled to campaign in Atlanta on Saturday.\n\nCaitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

During her rally in Atlanta, she directly challenged her Republican contender, Donald Trump, to engage her in a debate.\n\nThe rally attracted approximately 10,000 attendees and featured performances by renowned artists such as Megan Thee Stallion and Quavo. Additionally, Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock also made an appearance to rally support.\n\nRecent developments have altered the outlook for Democrats regarding Georgia, which once seemed difficult to win. Experts suggest that with a new candidate atop the ticket and renewed enthusiasm, the situation could shift dramatically.\n\nHarris stepped in as the presumed Democratic leader after President Biden withdrew from the race. \"It has been a reset button in so many ways,\" remarked Amy Morton, head of the consulting group Southern Majority. She noted that this change has significantly reshaped Georgia's electoral landscape.\n\nAs she addressed the enthusiastic crowd, Harris emphasized the changing dynamics of the race, asserting that her \"people-powered\" campaign, although underestimated, is gaining traction. She referenced Biden's victory in 2020, indicating a viable path for Democrats in Georgia.\n\nHarris noted, \"I am very clear the path to the White House runs right through this state.\"\n\nHarris shifted focus to the presidential debate scheduled for September, calling on Trump to engage directly. \"Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage because, as the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face,\" she declared, highlighting her willingness to confront her opponent directly.\n\nGeorgia's significance in national elections is underscored by its status as a swing state, capable of swinging either red or blue. Trump and Harris will both be campaigning in Atlanta, indicating the importance of solidifying their bases in this crucial state. Harris's presence has reportedly generated increased enthusiasm among voters, with Congressman Hank Jackson noting that \"an explosion of enthusiasm has been unleashed\" since her nomination.\n\nGeorgia Democrats rely heavily on high turnout from Black voters, a demographic that is particularly significant in the region. Recent polling suggests Harris has narrowed the gap with Trump, leading by a slight margin among registered voters nationally.\n\nUniversity of Georgia Professor Charles Bullock pointed out that the state's status is now on Harris's \"watch list,\" highlighting her numerous visits aimed at energizing the electorate.\n\nDespite the support for Trump, who retains a strong backing in Georgia, Harris seeks to broaden her appeal. Bullock indicated that Harris could potentially attract moderate Republicans who may be dissatisfied with Trump's conduct. This could be critical as she aims for a broader coalition, seeking engagement from key demographics ahead of the election.\n\nWhile addressing concerns about immigration, a prominent issue among Georgia voters, Harris pledged to revive a border security bill stalled by Trump during his time in office.\n\nAs the campaign progresses, the interplay between enthusiasm for Harris and the existing Trump support will be pivotal in determining the electoral landscape in Georgia, a critical battleground for both parties.", "source": {"uri": "theglobalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Global Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Warnock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raphael Warnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quavo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quavo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Morton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amy Morton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Georgia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774352", "eventUri": "eng-9774352", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

In that job I walked underground tunnels on that border,' she said. 'I went after drug cartels, human traffickers ... I prosecuted them in case after case and I won. Donald Trump on the other hand talked a big game about securing our border but he's not walking the talk. Or as my friend Quavo would say, he's not walking it like he talks it.'\n\nShe noted Trump 'tanked' the bipartisan deal on border funding 'because he thought it would help him win the election. Which goes to show Donald Trump doesn't care about your security, he only cares about himself.'\n\nShe vowed to pass the legislation as president.\n\nThe border is one of the biggest vulnerabilities for the vice president. Her team has argued she was not in charge of border security but of handling the root causes of migration.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris repeatedly attacked Donald Trump at her rally\n\nHarris was in Georgia to try and bring the battleground state to her corner.\n\n'I am very clear. The path to the White House runs right through this state. We did it in 2020 and we're going to do it again in 2024,' she said.\n\nShe rattled off her resume as a prosecutor, district attorney and attorney general of California.\n\n'In those roles I took on perpetrators of all kinds, predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain so hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type,' she said.\n\n'And I have been dealing with people like him my entire career,' she added.\n\n'Lock him up, lock him up,' the crowd demanded, their feet ponding on the bleachers.\n\nKamala Harris talks with reporters\n\nAnd when Harris noted Trump pulled out of their September debate, the crowd booed.\n\n'So he won't debate but he and his running mate have a lot to say about me,' she said. 'And, by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to be just plain weird.'\n\n'Well Donald I hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage because, as the saying goes, if you've got something to say' - the cheering of the crowd drowned her out.a\n\n'Lock him up,' the crowd yelled again.\n\nThere were 10,000 people cheering on the vice president in the Georgia State Convocation Center, according to the campaign.\n\nThe rally was Harris' largest campaign rally to date. It marks her first appearance in Georgia since she locked up the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nTrump and Vance will hold a campaign rally in Atlanta together on Saturday August 3, the Trump campaign announced on Tuesday.\n\nIt will be held in the same location as Harris' rally.\n\nAhead of Harris' remarks, a bevy of top Democrats in the state fired up the crowd, repeatedly reminding the attendees about Trump's attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia in the 2020 election.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion fired up the crowd ahead of Harris' remarks.\n\n'We're about to make history with the first female president. The first black female president. Let's get this done honey,' she told the cheering crowd.\n\nShe sang 'Girls in the Hood,' 'Mamushi,' 'Body,' and 'Savage' (massive thanks to CNN's DJ Judd for helping your pooler with the song IDs).\n\nAs she sang her song 'Body' she told the crowd: 'Now I know my ladies in the crowd love their bodies - and if you want to keep loving your body, you know who to vote for.'\n\nStacey Abrams, who has been one of Harris' most ardent defenders, received a standing ovation and shouts of 'Stacey' when she came out. Abrams, in turn, had the crowd shout 'Kamala, Kamala.'\n\nShe described Harris as someone who 'break barriers' in the White House.\n\nShe noted that, in Georgia, 'we do the job of changing America and we're going to do it again.'\n\nRead More Trump plans to change Air Force One to new patriotic color despite dangerous side effect\n\nBut it was Georgia's two Democratic senators - who handed the party control of the Senate - that remided the crowd of Trump's actions in the last presidential race.\n\nSenator Jon Ossoff told the crowd: 'Apparently Donald Trump is too scared to debate Vice President Karris.'\n\nHe added that the candidate who is too scared is the 'candidate who is losing.'\n\n'Too scared,' the crowd yelled. 'Too scared.'\n\nOssoff also talked about Trump's attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia.\n\n'Lock him up, lock him up,' the crowd yelled.\n\nAnd Senator Raphael Warnock emphasized the state's importance in the race for the White House.\n\n'Everyone knows the road to the White House goes through Georgia,' he said.\n\nHe noted others know it. 'As a matter of fact I heard a phone call. A Florida man, called into Georgia and said I need 11,000 votes,' he said, referring to Trump's phone call to the state's secretary of state in 2020.\n\nThe crowd roared with laughter and applause.\n\n'Georgia - Donald Trump tried to steal your vote. Kamala Harris is trying to earn your vote,' Warnock said.\n\nFailed Governor candidate Stacey Abrams (left) and Senator Jon Ossoff (right) warmed up the crowd for Harris\n\nVice President Kamala Harris stops at Paschal's restaurant before her rally\n\nGeorgia played a crucial role in the last presidential election, and it is expected to be just as significant this November. According to several polls released last week, it's a virtual toss-up between Harris and Trump.\n\nPolls showed Joe Biden trailed Trump significantly in the state but Harris does much better against the former president.\n\nShe outperforms Biden among young people, Black voters, and Hispanic voters, key demographics that could decide swing states like Georgia and Arizona.\n\nBiden only won the state by some 12,000 votes in 2020, a win heavily contested by Trump, who is currently in the midst of an election interference case in the state\n\nGeorgia is a top focus with less than 100 days to go before the election.\n\nThe Harris campaign noted it has 24 offices open in the state nd 170 staffers on the ground there.\n\n'In Georgia, we're running the largest in state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle ever,' campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.\n\nWhile in the state Harris plans to attack Trump for his ties to Project 2025 - an initiative from the Heritage Foundation that promotes conservative polices - and for his position on abortion rights.\n\nAnd while Harris focuses on Georgia, Trump will be focused on breaking the Democrats' blue wall.\n\nHe's holding a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday - his first visit back to the state since the assassination attempt on him in late June.\n\nHarris had surrogates in Pennsylvania on Monday to counter Trump - the state's Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmore. Both Democrats have been names as possible Harris running mates.\n\nThe Harris campaign also has had surrogates Georgia, as she weighs who to pick as her number two.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who is reported to be a potential running mate, was in in the state on Sunday.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with several other candidates, including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Govs. Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Tim Walz of Minnesota.\n\nShe is expected to choose her vice presidential candidate by Aug. 7.\n\n'Not yet,' Harris told reporters on Tuesday when asked if she's picked her running mate.\n\nHarris' campaign noted it's held some 2,300 organizing events in battleground states this weekend as several high-profile Democrats on her potential VP list stumped for her.\n\nWith less than 100 days to go until Election Day, the Harris campaign is touting its fundraising and infrastructure, arguing it is well-positioned to beat Trump in November.\n\nThe campaign has taken in $200 million since Harris emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week.\n\nOver 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The reporter said Harris had been speaking for 15 minutes before people began to leave.\n\nIn the clip, some of the attendees can be seen holding \"Kamala\" signs, and it is unclear whether they were leaving the venue or had exited their seats for another reason, such as going to the restroom.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion performed at the event before Harris spoke, and X users have theorized that rallygoers may have attended the event to see the performance.\n\nSince Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21 and endorsed Harris, the new presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has improved in polling among various demographics, including young people and Black voters, which could help her chances in some key swing states such as Georgia.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Harris' campaign for comment via email outside regular working hours.\n\nOn Truth Social, Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, took a jab at Harris over the rally, writing: \"Crazy Kamala Harris, voted the WORST Vice President in American history, needed a concert to bring people into the Atlanta arena, and they started leaving 5 minutes into her speech. I don't need concerts or entertainers, I just have to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nTrump has previously faced similar questions after scores of people were filmed appearing to leave his rallies early.\n\nThough some questioned whether rallygoers left early, others hailed the event as a triumph.\n\nOrganizers of the rally told The New York Times that about 10,000 people attended the event at the Georgia State University Convocation Center. The stadium's website says it has the capacity to accommodate up to 8,000.\n\nThe X account @harris_wins posted a video from the rally showing a boisterous crowd waving \"Kamala\" signs in the air.\n\n\"The media might not say it, but Democrats are by far more enthusiastic about electing Vice President Kamala Harris as President than Republicans are about electing Donald Trump,\" the pro-Harris account wrote.\n\nIn her speech, Harris made the case for her candidacy and challenged Trump to a debate.\n\n\"Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage because as the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face,\" she said.\n\nIn 2020, Biden won Georgia by the narrowest margin of any state, less than 12,000 votes.\n\nPolls from recent months have generally shown Trump winning the state.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with thousands of voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and celebrating an atmosphere that would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris is hoping a large rally, featuring a performance by hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion, will help affirm her campaign's momentum. The campaign argues that Harris' appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This campaign is about freedom,\" said Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, who was there with his fellow Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff. \"So the question is, do you want to be free? Or do you want to go back?\"\n\n\"When you show up, we win.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere, can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_weissert@thestar.com", "name": "Will Weissert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Belt Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Warnock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raphael Warnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikema_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikema Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Georgia (U.S. state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Atlanta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The momentum in this race is shifting, and \"Donald Trump is feeling it,\" she said.\n\nWith less than 100 days left in one of the least predictable campaign seasons in recent history, Democrats are redrawing their map to victory, hoping the prospect of the first Black and Asian woman president can motivate Democrats to the polls.\n\n\"We are not going back,\" Ms Harris said to cheers and chants of about 10,000 attendees.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion, whose album \"Megan\" recently launched at No. 1 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart, performed in a blue pantsuit and tie, the colour associated with Ms Harris' Democratic Party.\n\nShe joins a host of musicians who have recently come out in support of Ms Harris' bid to become the Democratic presidential nominee in the Nov 5 election.\n\nGeorgia Senator Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, said on MSNBC over the weekend that Ms Harris' entry into the race \"has put Georgia in play\" for Democrats and predicted she will win.\n\nSwing states like Georgia, which Democrats barely won in a hard-fought battle in 2020, are fiercely contested because they can lean either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.\n\nFiveThirtyEight, the poll aggregation site, shows Republican Donald Trump leading Ms Harris by between one and five percentage points in surveys taken after Ms Harris became the likely Democratic candidate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 22 and endorsed Ms Harris for the Nov 5 vote against Trump. Since then, Ms Harris' election campaign has raised US$200 million (S$270 million), signed up 170,000 new volunteers and she has significantly outperformed Mr Biden in recent polling among young people, Black voters and Hispanic voters.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published on July 25 found Ms Harris has narrowed a sizeable Trump lead, while Trump had a two percentage point lead in a Wall Street Journal poll published on July 26. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published July 23 showed a two point lead for Ms Harris.\n\nMr Biden's campaign saw a narrowing path to victory with the \"Sun Belt states,\" including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, as unlikely wins. Georgia backed Mr Biden by 0.2 percentage points, just under 12,000 votes in 2020, and Trump by around 5 percentage points in 2016.\n\nMr Andy Beshear, the twice-elected Democratic governor of deep-red Kentucky, visited Georgia over the weekend to campaign for Ms Harris in the Republican stronghold of Forsyth County.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota as possible vice presidential candidates.

But now that Biden has bowed out of the race and Harris is the likely nominee, Democrats are expressing new hopes of an expanded electoral map.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris pulled off what has been a signature Trump event: A big, loud rally full of supporters cheering her name, as she mocked her rival and his running mate JD Vance as \"just plain weird,\" and derided their policies as backward, outdated and dangerous.\n\nHarris mentioned Trump's efforts to stop the passage of an immigration bill that had bipartisan support and would have been among the strongest border security in decades. She said she'd work to push the bill across the finish line. \"I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed and I will sign it and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.\"\n\nTrump earlier said he'd debate Harris, but is now questioning the value of a meetup and saying he \"probably\" will debate her, but he \"can also make a case for not doing it.\"\n\nHarris seized on it. \"So he won't debate me, but he and his running mate have a lot to say about me,\" she said. \"And by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to just be plain weird.\"\n\n\"Well Donald,\" she said, addressing him head-on. \"I do hope you'll reconsider. Meet me on the debate stage ... because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\" Trump has suggested the Sept. 10 debate on ABC News should be moved to a different network, calling ABC \"fake news.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe roughly 8,000-capacity basketball arena at Georgia State University was filled to its rafters with voters waving signs, dancing to the Harris campaign soundtrack and a performance by Megan Thee Stallion. Such an atmosphere would not have been possible just 10 days ago, with the party reeling over whether the 81-year-old Biden would remain in the race after a dismal performance magnified concerns about his age and abilities and ultimately ended his campaign.\n\n\"This is like Barack Obama 2008 on steroids for me,\" said Mildred Hobson Doss, a 59-year-old who came downtown from suburban Lilburn. \"I would have voted for President Biden again. But we are ready.\"\n\nHarris' campaign argues her appeal to young people, working-age women and non-white voters has scrambled the dynamics in Georgia and other states that are demographically similar, from North Carolina to Nevada and Arizona.\n\nIn a strategy memo released after the president left the race, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who held the same role for Biden, reaffirmed the importance of winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, a trio of industrial states that have formed the traditional Democratic blue wall.\n\nBut she also argued that the vice president's place atop the ticket \"opens up additional persuadable voters\" and described them as \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" in places like Georgia.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The energy is infectious,\" said Georgia Democratic Chairwoman Nikema Williams, a congresswoman from Atlanta. \"My phone has been blowing up. People want to be part of this movement.\"\n\nHarris began Tuesday with her days as a prosecutor -- setting up the contrast between the law and Trump's many legal problems and misdeeds. But she also aggressively defended the Biden administration's record and she'd work to pass voting rights legislation and work to restore reproductive rights stripped by the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"America has tried these failed policies before. And we are not going back. We're not going back,\" she said, shaking her head no as the crowd cheered \"we're not going back.\"\n\nRepublicans, who still control Georgia's state government, counter that Biden's lagging popularity and concern over higher consumer prices and immigration will transfer to Harris in the historically conservative state.\n\nBut they concede that the landscape suddenly looks much closer to 2020 - when Biden won by about 0.25 percentage points -- than when Trump was riding high after the Republican National Convention and surviving an assassination attempt.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Trump was going to win Georgia. It was over,\" said Republican consultant Brian Robinson. \"The Democrats have a chance here for a reset.\"\n\nAnd Trump is not taking chances. Earlier Tuesday, the former president announced that he would come to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same Georgia State arena.\n\nRobinson said Harris still has plenty of liabilities, including the progressive positions she took in her failed 2020 primary campaign and her various rhetorical stumbles. But he said Harris so far in this campaign has been \"in command,\" and if that continues, \"we have a new ballgame and she will be competitive in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed Harris as \"just as weak, failed and incompetent as Joe Biden\" and said the vice president would have to explain her support of Biden administration policies that \"hurt working families in Georgia over the past four years.\"\n\nThe campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nIn a call with supporters after her speech, Harris thanked them for their work and noted early voting starts in some states in just 38 days. She hasn't yet formally seized the nomination, nor picked a running mate; both are expected soon.\n\n\"This is a sprint,\" she said. \"And we know what we need to do to cross the finish line.\"\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\n___\n\nLong reported from Washington.

"title": "Crowd erupts as Kamala Harris issues challenge to Trump at rally", "body": "US Vice President Kamala Harris has challenged Donald Trump to a presidential debate before Americans head to polls to decide the next leader of the free world.\n\nThe Republican nominee this week appeared to backtrack from an earlier commitment to debate his rival, saying he \"probably\" will but \"can also make a case for not doing it\".\n\nThe 78-year-old was pressed multiple times in an interview with Fox News and insisted he wanted to debate Ms Harris but added: \"Everybody knows who I am.\"\n\n\"The answer is yes, I'll probably end up debating,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nMs Harris on Tuesday night (local time) continued her presidential campaign across the United States as she stopped in Atlanta, Georgia, for a raucous rally.\n\nSome 10,000 supporters gathered at the Georgia State University Convocation Centre to watch the VP's event attended by Democrats and celebrities.\n\nIn her 21-minute speech, she pointed to the differences in her policies compared to Republicans, such as on border security and propping up middle Americans.\n\nBut towards the end of her address, Ms Harris challenged Trump to the debate he had previously agreed to when US President Joe Biden was the favoured nominee.\n\n\"Well Donald,\" she said with a dramatic pause as the crowd's cheers grew louder, \"I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage.\"\n\n\"Because as the saying goes, 'If you've got something to say, say it to my face'.\"\n\nMs Harris also suggested, \"The momentum in this race is shifting and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it (the competition).\"\n\nGeorgia is one of the key battleground states in the election.\n\nIt has largely been won by Republicans, but that shifted in 2020 when Mr Biden narrowly edged out Mr Trump by 0.02 per cent of the vote.\n\nIt was also the same state where President Joe Biden had his first debate with Mr Trump, which was later labelled as \"disastrous\" due to his ability to answer questions.\n\nMs Harris insisted Georgia is a must-win state for her path to the White House.\n\n\"You all helped us win in 2020 and we are going to do it again in 2024,\" she told the rally.\n\nThe campaign was also attended by Grammy-winning American rapper Megan Thee Stallion who performed her hit song Savage and new track Mamushi.\n\nMs Harris last week secured enough support from delegates to become the Democratic presidential nominee ahead of the party's national convention on August 19-22.\n\nHowever, she has yet to pick a running mate and prior to Tuesday's rally, she said she had \"not yet\" made a decision.\n\nThere have been suggestions she will name her vice presidential candidate early next week, before going on the campaign trail.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump and his running mate JD Vance will hold their first joint rally in Atlanta at the same venue as Ms Harris' campaign on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri":

Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nDemocrats are betting that a combination of high turnout among traditional, core Democratic constituencies, as well as a strong showing in the suburbs and small pickups elsewhere, can be enough for Harris to carry Georgia. That approach was on display at the weekend office openings.\n\nOn Saturday, the venue was East Point, a majority Black municipality and Democratic stronghold south of Atlanta. Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., was the featured guest, telling a crowd of mostly Black women that they were the key to victory -- \"the people who are really going to save the country.\"\n\nA day later, it was Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, among several contenders Harris is considering for her running mate, campaigning in Forsyth County. The area is historically very conservative, though Democrats have narrowed the GOP margins in recent cycles.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Every county matters,\" Beshear said, holding out his ability to win two governor's races in Kentucky despite Trump's domination of the state in presidential elections.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview that the best GOP campaigns can win comfortably in Georgia but bad efforts -- combined with strong Democratic campaigns -- lose. Kemp, for example, won reelection by 7.5 percentage points in 2022 over national Democratic star Stacey Abrams. Yet in the same election cycle, Georgians reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock over his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, who was endorsed by Trump.\n\nIn recent elections, Democrats have held wide advantages in the core of metro Atlanta, where Jayapal spoke. The party also performed well in Columbus and Savannah, as well as some rural, majority-Black counties. But Republicans dominated in other rural areas and small towns and cities -- where Trump has held multiple rallies in recent years.\n\nThe fast-growing, diversifying Atlanta suburbs and exurbs, like those where Beshear campaigned on Sunday, offer the most opportunity for swings, especially from GOP-leaning moderates disenchanted with Trump.\n\nFor Harris, that means depending on voters as varied as Michael Sleister, a white suburbanite, and Allen Smith, a Black man who lives not far from downtown Atlanta.\n\nSleister, who considers himself an independent, has lived in Forsyth County for 35 years. \"I've voted Republican many times in my life,\" he said, but not since the GOP took a rightward turn during President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Now I see the Republican Party as representing a direct threat to my grandchildren,\" he said, adding that he sees Trump \"as just a horrible person.\"\n\nSmith is a 41-year-old Atlanta native who has become a first-time campaign volunteer since Harris became the likely nominee.\n\n\"I was driving when I heard the news about President Biden endorsing her, and I started pounding my fist -- I decided right then I would do whatever I could to help her get elected,\" Smith said.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at

However, if you were watching Fox News, a channel that supports the MAGA movement, you would not have seen any of this. On the Rupert Murdoch-owned site, Laura Ingraham criticized law enforcement for its investigation into the social media accounts of Thomas Crooks, the 21-year-old who tried to shoot Trump at a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nRELATED: Major Hollywood Donors Already Writing Checks, 'Excited and Motivated' for Kamala Harris After Joe Biden Departs\n\nThe Fox host has also been treated to other pre-taped interviews with Trump. In an interview Monday, Trump told Ingraham that he would \"probably\" face Harris in the fall, but that he \"could also make a case not to.\" When Ingraham tried to pressure Trump to get in the ring with the vice president, the former Celebrity Apprentice host responded that he didn't want to \"reward fake news\" like ABC or make them \"rich.\"\n\nRELATED: Michael Cieply: Will Hollywood's glamour factor hurt Kamala Harris?\n\nFacing a candidate very different from the President Biden he faced on CNN on June 27, it is not certain that Trump will be able to face Harris in a month.

Several state-level polls in swing states since Harris announced her candidacy show a tighter race as well.\n\nThe candidates themselves have both implicitly and explicitly acknowledged the altered political map. On the airwaves, both campaigns are launching multimillion-dollar ad buys in the key battleground states. Harris' campaign is running a spot that highlights her background as a prosecutor and Trump's video attacks Harris as weak on immigration issues.\n\nHarris held a rally in Atlanta Tuesday night, the largest of the campaign so far, in front of thousands of supporters at Georgia State University's Convocation Center.\n\n\"Georgia, it is so good to be back, and I am very clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state,\" Harris said to a filled 10,000-person arena. \"And you all helped us win in 2020 -- and we're gonna do it again in 2024!\"\n\nTrump and his vice presidential nominee, Ohio U.S. Sen. JD Vance, will hold a rally at the same location on Saturday.\n\nGeorgia in particular is seen as an opportunity for the Harris campaign to improve before Election Day.\n\nNearly a third of the electorate is Black, Atlanta's suburbs are home to a sizable share of moderate voters who have voted for Republicans and Democrats in past elections, and the Harris campaign says it is making record staffing investments.\n\n\"In Georgia, we're running the largest in-state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle ever,\" Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler said to reporters. \"Since the vice president began her candidacy, we've seen tremendous energy on the ground.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign is not ceding focus on the Sun Belt, though.\n\nVance is campaigning in Nevada and Arizona this week, with a planned appearance at the U.S. southern border on Thursday.\n\nArizona and Georgia are also two primary states where Republicans' \"Trump Force 47\" campaign strategy to use volunteers to lead targeted get-out-the-vote efforts is in full swing.\n\nAs both Trump and Harris continue to make their case to voters in these swing states over the next three months, there are still several key events that could continue to shape the contour of the race, like Harris naming her vice presidential pick, the Democratic National Convention next month in Chicago and any potential debates between Trump and Harris before voting begins.\n\nHarris is set to announce her running mate within days, and the campaign says they will do a series of rallies, a tour that will begin on Tuesday and take them to Philadelphia, western Wisconsin, Detroit, Raleigh, N.C., Savannah, Ga., Phoenix and Las Vegas.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

And we are the underdogs in this race.\"\n\nHarris's nascent presidential bid took off following Biden's July 21 exit from the race, with much of the party coalescing behind her and her campaign raising a staggering $200 million.\n\n\"The momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it,\" she said.\n\nThe Republican nominee recently said he would forego political tradition and not debate Harris and also unleashed a barrage of insults against his rival, calling her \"crazy\" and a \"bum.\"\n\n\"Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face,\" Harris said, to roars of approval.\n\nHarris also repeated her popular line about how, as a former prosecutor and California attorney general going up against predators and fraudsters, she knows \"Donald Trump's type.\"\n\n\"In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,\" she said.\n\n'Extreme abortion bans'\n\nWith just 98 days before the election, Harris is under pressure to announce her vice presidential pick. Asked Tuesday whether she had chosen one, Harris told reporters: \"Not yet.\"\n\nThe search must be nearing a conclusion, however, as her team announced Tuesday that Harris and her new running mate would campaign next week in battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nWith the White House race turned on its head, 59-year-old Harris on Tuesday unveiled her first television ad since replacing Biden, while the Trump camp released a dueling spot attacking her on the crucial election issue of immigration.\n\nHarris swatted away the attack, saying in her speech that while the Biden administration worked with conservatives to craft critical border legislation, Trump \"tanked\" it for political gain.\n\n\"Donald Trump does not care about border security,\" she said. \"He only cares about himself.\"\n\nHarris said if elected she would focus on key economic goals such as expanding affordable health care and tackling rising consumer costs.\n\nShe also attacked Trump, 78, over his \"extreme abortion bans,\" referring to restrictive new laws enacted in several states in the two years since the US Supreme Court -- featuring three justices nominated by Trump -- stripped constitutional protections for abortion.\n\nGeorgia in play\n\nAs for Georgia's potential competitiveness, Harris insisted \"the path to the White House runs right through this state.\"\n\nIn a sign the southern state will be bitterly contested, Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance announced they would hold their own rally Saturday in Atlanta.\n\n\"Kamala Harris and her complicit cronies have made the great people of Georgia pay a hefty price for their woke policies,\" the Trump campaign said Tuesday.\n\nHarris took over a bleak electoral map from the faltering Biden, with Democrats' hopes entirely based on the three Rust Belt post-industrial states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut they are now looking again at other \"sunbelt\" states such as Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, all of which Democrats narrowly won in 2020.\n\nVance addressed a rally Tuesday in Henderson, Nevada, where he attacked Harris as \"dangerously liberal,\" while Trump campaigns in Pennsylvania on Wednesday.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nAdding some Atlanta glitz for younger voters w\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@ndtv.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Andy Beshear along with several other candidates, including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Govs. Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Tim Walz of Minnesota.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAP_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WAP (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_in_the_Hood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Girls in the Hood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Migos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

US Senator Raphael Warnock endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the new Democratic nominee for president.\n\nBefore Kamala Harris took the stage at her campaign event on Tuesday, the atmosphere felt more like a party than a political rally. Some 10,000 supporters had lined up hours before to see the vice president in Atlanta, facing heat and Georgia's infamous summer storms.\n\nOnce inside the arena, a procession of Georgia's political heavyweights took the stage in support of Harris, including Atlanta Major Andre Dickens, former Democratic candidate for governor Stacey Abrams, and Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.\n\nSongs spanning musical genres - from Whitney Houston to Migos - blasted through the speakers. The crowd, energized by a fresh campaign, danced with signs that simply read \"KAMALA.\" Megan Thee Stallion hit the stage right before Harris, performing in a bright blue pantsuit to her top hits \"Mamushi\" and \"Body.\"\n\nKamala Harris takes the stage\n\nThe packed arena erupted into applause as Harris walked out to Beyonce's 2016 song \"Freedom.\" But Harris was all business upon taking the stage, marking her 15th visit to Georgia since taking office and her first to the battleground state as the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\n\"As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, and before I was elected a United States senator ... I was a courtroom prosecutor,\" Harris said. \"So in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds; predators who broke the rules for their own game.\"\n\nShe went on to discuss her time as attorney general for California.\n\n\"As attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud,\" Harris said. \"Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud. Through this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day.\"\n\nHarris also staunchly defended the record of the Biden-Harris administration, focusing on its immigration policies and stance on border security.\n\nShe dismissed the attacks that have dogged her about being Biden's \"border czar.\" Harris described walking through underground tunnels with Border Patrol agents to help catch - and ultimately prosecute - drug dealers and members of cartels during her time as attorney general of a border state.\n\nMore: VP Kamala Harris to make stop in Savannah with soon-to-be named running mate\n\nHarris also issued a challenge to Trump, demanding he face her on the debate stage. Trump previously said he will not commit to debating Harris because he's not sure she'll be the nominee.\n\nThe crowd broke out into cheers when Harris delivered what was likely her best received line of the night: \"I do hope you'll reconsider and meet me on the debate stage, because, as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face!\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.savannahnow.com",

Beyonc\u00e9 let the world know she was down with the Harris campaign by allowing her to use her song \"Freedom\" as walkout music. It was also featured in the first television ad announcing her presidential campaign.\n\nJohn Legend will be at the DNC in August, where Harris will undoubtedly earn the nomination as the Democrat's choice to take on Donald Trump in the upcoming election.\n\nTaylor Swift is also rallying her Swifties to support VP Harris and ensure that Trump does not regain the White House.\n\nCardi B has shown support for Vice President Harris but has stopped short of endorsing her, conditioning her support on Harris securing a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nHopefully, Cardi B knows that VP Harris can't make that happen alone.\n\nStill, Harris has made it clear after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that it's time for the war to end, and a two-state solution should be the end goal.\n\nCompared to the Republicans rolling out acts like Kid Rock, Amber Rose, and other musical acts that no one gives a damn about, the Democrats have an all-star lineup looking to help our MVP finally break the glass ceiling that Hillary Clinton fell short of doing during the 2016 election.\n\nAs expected, the Hotties and the K-Hive are excited about the news of Megan Thee Stallion

He will bring his pick for vice president, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nOne Republican strategist who spoke with FOX 5 Atlanta said that with Harris at the top of the ticket, the dynamics have certainly changed in Georgia.\n\n\"It's wise for the Trump campaign and it's wise for the Harris campaign to be focusing on Georgia,\" said Brian Robinson, who also serves as a panelist for Georgia Gang, Atlanta's longest-running public affairs broadcast on FOX 5 Atlanta.\n\nGeorgia has been living up to its status as a battleground state in the 2024 presidential election. Just a month ago, President Joe Biden's performance at the Atlanta debate against Trump changed the tides of the upcoming election.\n\n\"By having not only Trump, but having a dual rally with both Trump and Sen. Vance, you see that they're ready to go toe-to-toe in Georgia,\" said Robinson. \"They're not taking Georgia for granted. They're going to come here, and they're going to compete, and they're going to dig in. That's very wise.\"\n\nAt a rally in Nevada on Tuesday, Sen. JD Vance slammed Harris for the Democrats' record on immigration.\n\n\"If the failed borders czar wins, she's not going to stop until every illegal immigrant has the right to vote, which is going to destroy your voice your country to make room for people who shouldn't even be here,\" he claimed.\n\nAttorney General Chris Carr also slammed Harris on X, calling her a \"San Francisco leftist\" who wanted to decriminalize illegal immigration.\n\nMichael Whatley, the chairman of the Republican National Convention, wrote, \"if she really cared about Georgia she would end the border bloodbath that led to the brutal murder of Laken Riley.\"\n\nKamala addressed their claims at her rally.\n\n\"I was the attorney general of a border state. In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,\" she said.\n\nTrump hit back on attacks from the left at a rally earlier in July after his assassination attempt.\n\n\"They keep saying, 'He's a threat to democracy.' I keep thinking, 'What the hell did I do to democracy? Last week, I took a bullet for democracy,'\" he said.\n\nRobinson said the Trump team's work in Georgia should be clear.\n\n\"He needs to emphasize the failure of the Biden administration, and pivot to his vision for rebuilding the economy,\" he said.\n\nOne thing is for certain, Rev. Raphael Warnock stated during Harris' Atlanta rally: \"Georgia is on everybody's mind.\"\n\n\"I am 100% sure when you see Donald Trump and J.D. Vance here on Saturday, you're going to see some direct appeals to Black voters,\" said Robinson. \"Black voters are 30% of our electorate here in Georgia, and Biden was really struggling, particularly with Black men. Can Kamala Harris change that equation?\"\n\nRELATED: Harris vs. Trump: Black men hold special meeting in Atlanta to discuss 2024 election\n\nRobinson said the other two key groups in Georgia's electorate are Gen-Z voters and white suburbanites.\n\nMORE: Kamala Harris delivers virtual address at Atlanta Voters of Tomorrow Summit\n\nRobinson also highlighted the unique aspects of Georgia as a swing state.\n\n\"What makes us different from the other swing states is our diversity,\" he said. \"He needs to emphasize the failure of the Biden administration and pivot to his vision for rebuilding the economy.\"\n\nWATCH THE LATEST EPISODE OF BATTLEGROUND WITH HOST S.E.

Additionally, Beyonc\u00e9' cleared the usage of her 2016 track \"Freedom\" to be used as VP Harris' walkout song ahead of a campaign speech.\n\nWithin the first week of confirming her presidential candidacy after current President Joe Biden decided to withdraw from the race, VP Harris raised over $200 million and gained 70,000 volunteers committed to assisting with \"phone banking, canvassing,

In her first big rally as the nominee, the vice president called out the three-time Republican presidential candidate to keep his word about the ABC News-hosted debate set for September 10 that he had previously agreed to do against Biden.\n\n\"So the momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it,\" the veep and presumptive Democratic nominee told an enthusiastic crowd of more than 10,000 just now in Atlanta as polls have Harris tied and even ahead of Trump a week into her White House bid.

However, if you were watching the MAGA-friendly Fox News, you would have seen none of it. Over on the Rupert Murdoch-owned outlet, Laura Ingraham was slamming law enforcement for its investigation into the social media accounts of Thomas Crooks, the 21-year-old who tried to shoot Trump at a July 13 rally in Butler, PA.\n\nRELATED: Top Hollywood Donors Already Writing Checks, \"Excited & Motivated\" For Kamala Harris After Joe Biden's Exit\n\nThe Fox host also had more of her pre-recorded sit-down with Trump. An interview on Monday, Trump was shown telling Ingraham that he \"probably\" will face off against Harris in the fall, but he \"can also make a case for not doing it.\" When Ingraham tried to press Trump on getting in the ring with the vice president, the ex-Celebrity Apprentice host replied he didn't want to \"reward fake news\" like ABC or make them \"rich.\"\n\nRELATED: Michael Cieply: Will The Hollywood Glam Factor Hurt Kamala Harris?\n\nUp against a vert different candidate than the stumbling President Biden he took on back on June 27 on CNN, it is unsure if Trump will go face-to-face with Harris in a month.

And we are the underdogs in this race.\"\n\nHarris's nascent presidential bid took off following Biden's July 21 exit from the race, with much of the party coalescing behind her and her campaign raising a staggering $200 million.\n\n\"The momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it,\" she said.\n\nThe Republican nominee recently said he would forego political tradition and not debate Harris, and also unleashed a barrage of insults against his rival, calling her \"crazy\" and a \"bum.\"\n\n\"Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face,\" Harris said, to roars of approval.\n\nHarris also repeated her popular line about how, as a former prosecutor and California attorney general going up against predators and fraudsters, she knows \"Donald Trump's type.\"\n\n\"In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,\" she said.\n\nWith just 98 days before the election, Harris is under pressure to announce her vice presidential pick. Asked Tuesday whether she had chosen one, Harris told reporters: \"Not yet.\"\n\nThe search must be nearing a conclusion, however, as her team announced Tuesday that Harris and her new running mate would campaign next week in battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nWith the White House race turned on its head, 59-year-old Harris on Tuesday unveiled her first television ad since replacing Biden, while the Trump camp released a dueling spot attacking her on the crucial election issue of immigration.\n\nHarris swatted away the attack, saying in her speech that while the Biden administration worked with conservatives to craft critical border legislation, Trump \"tanked\" it for political gain.", "source": {"uri": "enca.com",

Since then, Harris' election campaign has raised $200 million, signed up 170,000 new volunteers and she has significantly outperformed Biden in recent polling among young people, Black voters and Hispanic voters.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College national poll published Thursday found Harris has narrowed a sizable Trump lead, while Trump had a two percentage point lead in a Wall Street Journal poll published on Friday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published July 23 showed a two point lead for Harris.\n\nBiden's campaign saw a narrowing path to victory with the \"Sun Belt states,\" including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, as unlikely wins. Georgia backed Biden by 0.2 percentage points, just under 12,000 votes in 2020, and Trump by around 5 percentage points in 2016.\n\nAndy Beshear, the twice-elected Democratic governor of deep-red Kentucky, visited Georgia over the weekend to campaign for Harris in the Republican stronghold of Forsyth County.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota as possible vice presidential candidates. A decision is expected by Aug. 7.\n\nHarris is leaning into her resume as a former district attorney and California attorney general, seeking to draw a contrast with Trump who is the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes.\n\nTrump and 14 co-defendants are accused of racketeering and other charges for their role in attempting to overturn Biden's narrow win in Georgia.\n\n(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Heather Timmons, Stephen Coates, Deepa Babington and Chris Reese)", "source": {"uri":

Donations were drying up, while candidates and elected officials were speaking openly and with a grave certainty that the party was destined for an extinction-level electoral wipeout in November.\n\nIn the world of two weeks ago, the graphic Democratic euphoria on display in Atlanta Tuesday would have been almost inconceivable: a Division I basketball arena packed so full of ecstatic supporters that the fire marshal was refusing to let anyone else in. There was simply no space left. Ticket holders, credentialed press, elected officials who failed to make it inside the Georgia Convocation Center lined the barricades along Capitol Avenue, in the 91-degree heat, to watch a succession of celebrities on the Jumbotron.\n\nIt's been just ten days since Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential campaign, and the vibe shift was spectacular. Vice President Kamala Harris' Atlanta rally -- the first bonafide campaign event since she took control of the Democratic ticket -- had the energy of a homecoming rally. Stacey Abrams, Sen. Jon Ossoff, and Sen. Raphael Warnock spoke. Megan Thee Stallion stunted on stage, a \"Hotties for Harris\" banner billowing in the stands behind her. \"I know my ladies in the crowd love their bodies,\" she said. \"And if you want to keep loving your body, you know who to vote for.\" Quavo of Migos introduced the guy who introduced the vice president.\n\nPeggy Golden traveled from her home in Savannah to be here: \"This is history,\" she says. Golden is going to be 79 in December; she was born before the Civil Rights movement began. \"I was brought up on a plantation,\" she says. Her parents were a cook and caretaker. \"I didn't expect it to happen in my lifetime -- and, hey, here it is,\" she says of seeing a woman -- a black woman -- become president. \"I feel it in my bones that it's going to happen.\"\n\nBut for all the excitement -- and there seemed to be an endless supply of it in Atlanta -- some attendees were still reeling from the political whiplash of the last few weeks. \"I loved Biden and I was heartbroken when he dropped out of the race,\" Lynda Cosby-Pinnock says. And she cautions Harris still has work to do to convince members of her own community she deserves their support, \"Some people say they don't know who she is, they're not sure what she stands for,\" she says.\n\nSydney Rhodes, a 28-year-old influencer, says she was always going to vote for the Democratic candidate: \"I would vote for anybody besides Donald Trump and Project 2025.\" But, she adds, \"I think a lot of people are unsure because of the quick switch, and I hear a lot of people talk about her past as a prosecutor.\"\n\nHarris, for her part, is not shying away from her history as a prosecutor, district attorney, or attorney general. On stage in Atlanta, she lead with what has become her signature line: \"In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain -- so hear me when I say I know Donald Trump's type.\"\n\nAnd in Atlanta, Harris showed a new willingness to place, at the center of the campaign, an issue Republicans are convinced is her biggest weakness: immigration.\n\n\"I was the attorney general of a border state,\" Harris said on stage on Tuesday. \"In that job I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk. Or, as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it.\"\n\nBiden -- with Harris' help -- won Georgia in 2020, but it will be a heavier lift four years later: As Rolling Stone has reported, Trump's allies' have transformed the state into a \"laboratory\" for strategies to contest the 2024 election, as one source close to the former president put it. Georgia Republicans have enacted a sweeping voter suppression law, empowered activists to file mass challenges to residents' voter registrations, and packed the state and county election boards with Trump devotees who both believe his lies about the 2020 election and who have shown an increasing willingness to refuse to certify election results.\n\nBy launching her campaign in Atlanta, the Harris campaign was sending a clear signal: They intend to compete everywhere, including in states that seemed, two weeks ago, to be slipping out of their grip.\n\nAccording to the campaign, more than 7,500 have signed up to volunteer in Georgia in the last week alone. In a call with reporters ahead of the launch, a Georgia state director for the Harris campaign reported that they've hired more than 170 Democratic staffers across 24 offices around the state -- the largest in-state operation of a Democratic presidential campaign, she said, ever. And when she touched down in Atlanta on Tuesday afternoon, it was the sixth time Vice President Harris has traveled to Georgia this year, and her 15th trip since taking office in 2020.\n\n\"I am very clear: the path to the White House runs right through this state,\" Harris said on Tuesday. \"You are helped us win in 2020 -- and we're going to do it again in 2024.\"", "source": {"uri":

Beyonc\u00e9 let the world know she was down with the Harris campaign by allowing her to use her song \"Freedom\" as walkout music. It was also featured in the first television ad announcing her presidential campaign.\n\nJohn Legend will be at the DNC in August, where Harris will undoubtedly earn the nomination as the Democrat's choice to take on Donald Trump in the upcoming election.\n\nTaylor Swift is also rallying her Swifties to support VP Harris and ensure that Trump does not regain the White House.\n\nCardi B has shown support for Vice President Harris but has stopped short of endorsing her, conditioning her support on Harris securing a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nHopefully, Cardi B knows that VP Harris can't make that happen alone.\n\nStill, Harris has made it clear after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that it's time for the war to end, and a two-state solution should be the end goal.\n\nCompared to the Republicans rolling out acts like Kid Rock, Amber Rose, and other musical acts that no one gives a damn about, the Democrats have an all-star lineup looking to help our MVP finally break the glass ceiling that Hillary Clinton fell short of doing during the 2016 election.\n\nAs expected, the Hotties and the K-Hive are excited about the news of Megan Thee Stallion

She called out her 2024 presidential rival at a campaign rally in Atlanta as 'not walking it like he talks it' on illegal immigration.\n\nWith the Migos rapper in attendance - along with raunchy 'Savage' performer Megan Thee Stallion - the vice president also pushed her Republican rival to commit to one or more debates rather than continue to publicly call her names, challenging him to 'say it to my face.' After statements from both performers, Harris attempted to turn the tables on the open borders argument by blaming Trump, leaning into her background as an attorney general in California, a state she was quick to remind attendees, shares a border with Mexico. 'I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally,' Harris said. 'I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,' she continued. 'Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk. 'Or as my friend Quavo would say, he's not walking it like he talks it,' she quickly added, in reference to the rapper's 2018 Migos hit, 'Walk It, Talk It.'\n\nTo bolster her point, Harris pointed to the prospective pressure Trump put on his Republican allies within the Senate this past January, when he reportedly told them to kill any border legislation that wasn't 'perfect.' Her comments appeared to come in reference to a recent ad being run by Trump's team, which focuses on Harris's questionable record when it comes immigration. Branded a failed 'Border Czar', Harris went on to slam Trump's hesitance to debate as 'weird' - the most recent anti-GOP mantra being used by Harris and Democrats against the Trump-J.D. Vance ticket. She also referenced how Trump has called her 'crazy' and a '[expletive]' - criticisms she said would be better made face-to-face. 'I do hope you'll reconsider to [meeting] me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face,' Harris, 59, said shortly after taking the podium. She went on to express her desire to win come November and unite the country in the process, while framing her conservative rival as a phony who 'does not care.'\n\nAt the time, many believed the decision was made to hinder the current commander-in-chief's biggest chance at reelection if the plan fell apart - which it inevitably did. Moreover, the bill had been a compromise, drafted by Republicans and Democrats over the course of several months only to be tossed. 'He tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election, which goes to show Donald Trump does not care about border security,' Harris said in response. 'He only cares about himself,' she further claimed, vowing to revive the bipartisan border bill if elected. Aside from claiming Trump obliquely had the bipartisan border bill killed just to make Joe Biden look bad, Harris kept honing in on Trump's apparent reluctance to meet her in the proverbial ring. With the election less than 100 days away, Trump had initially agreed to debate Harris, but more recently questioned the value of such a meetup as he remains ahead in most polls. In an interview with Fox News that aired Monday, the candidate was pressed several times about committing, before giving a more free-form answer than he had in recent days. 'I want to do a debate,' he told Laura Ingraham. 'But I also can say this. Everybody knows who I am. And now people know who she is.' He eventually said, 'The answer is yes, I'll probably end up debating.'\n\nThis prompted Harris's campaign to brand the firebrand 'scared', an ode to his own open criticisms of fellow candidates on the debate stages back in 2015 and 2016. When Harris brought this up, and how Trump had pulled out for a debate slated for September, the crowd booed. 'So he won't debate but he and his running mate have a lot to say about me,' she told onlookers, before offering her party's latest pandering buzzword after others - and trends on TikTok - failed to stick. 'And, by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to be just plain weird,' she said, before being met with uproarious applause. The simple descriptor has become the new line of criticism against Republicans, and aside from being concise, it has resonated with Harris supporters. It has also successfully framed divisive figures like JD Vance as not being the most privy to the needs - and fads - of young people. The Ohio junior senator has received a lambasting after saying political leaders who didn't have biological children 'don't really have a direct stake' in the country.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion was one of the first, telling onlookers 'We're about to make history with the first female president. The first black female president. Let's get this done honey. She went on to sing 'Girls in the Hood,' 'Mamushi,' and 'Savage', and before her performance of 'Body', she told the crowd: 'Now I know my ladies in the crowd love their bodies. 'If you want to keep loving your body, you know who to vote for.'\n\nStacey Abrams (pictured), who has been one of Harris' most ardent defenders, was next, and received a standing ovation and shouts of 'Stacey' when she came out. Abrams, in turn, had the crowd shout 'Kamala, Kamala.' She described Harris as someone who 'break barriers' in the White House , and noted how, in Georgia, 'we do the job of changing America and we're going to do it again.' But it was Georgia's two Democratic senators - who handed the party control of the Senate - that reminded the crowd of Trump's actions in the last presidential race.\n\nSenator Jon Ossoff told the crowd: 'Apparently Donald Trump is too scared to debate Vice President Karris.' He added that the candidate who is too scared is the 'candidate who is losing.' 'Too scared,' the crowd yelled. 'Too scared.' Ossoff also talked about Trump's attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia. 'Lock him up, lock him up,' the crowd yelled. And Senator Raphael Warnock emphasized the state's importance in the race for the White House. 'Everyone knows the road to the White House goes through Georgia,' he said. He noted others know it. 'As a matter of fact I heard a phone call. A Florida man, called into Georgia and said I need 11,000 votes,' he said, referring to Trump's phone call to the state's secretary of state in 2020. The crowd roared with laughter and applause. 'Georgia - Donald Trump tried to steal your vote. Kamala Harris is trying to earn your vote,' Warnock said.\n\nQuavo also spoke, addressing the prevailing problems surrounding high rates of gun violence. To emphasis his point, he also used a phrase ever-popular with Millennials and Gen-Z. 'If y'all don't know me, I got by the name of Quavo. Born and raised in the North side of Atlanta, the home of the Migos,' he said. 'This city has always been home to me. From playing in the streets to, and you know, nurturing me to teaching me how to be the man that I am standing before you today. 'So, I mean one of the issues that I care about is resolving the gun violence,' he continued, after losing his nephew and Migos bandmate, Takeoff, to a Houston shooting in 2022. 'You can't understand the struggles of gun violence if you not in the field or the heart of it. 'So, one thing I learned about working with Vice President Harris is she always stand on business,' he declared, offering his endorsement on-stage. As for Harris, who was tasked with addressing the root causes of migration from Central America just months into her tenure with vice president, she qucikly brushed away Trump's characterization of her as a failed border czar - a title he himself created that she never held. \"Donald Trump does not care about border security -- he only cares about himself,\" Harris insistd. 'As president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed, and I will sign it into law, and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like,\" she said.\n\nHer team has argued she was not in charge of border security but of handling the root causes of migration. The rally, meanwhile, was Harris' largest campaign rally to date. It marked her first appearance in Georgia since she locked up the Democratic presidential nomination, and saw her beat Trump to the punch in the key battleground state. Trump and Vance will hold a campaign rally in Atlanta together on Saturday August 3, at t he same location as Harris' rally. Georgia played a crucial role in the last presidential election, and it is expected to be just as significant this time around. According to several polls released last week, it's a virtual toss-up between Harris and Trump. Polls showed Joe Biden trailed Trump significantly in the state but Harris does much better against the former president. She outperforms Biden among young people, Black voters, and Hispanic voters, key demographics that could decide swing states like Georgia and Arizona. Biden only won the state by some 12,000 votes in 2020, a win heavily contested by Trump, who is currently in the midst of an election interference case in the state Georgia is a top focus with less than 100 days to go before the election. The Harris campaign noted it has 24 offices open in the state nd 170 staffers on the ground there. 'In Georgia, we're running the largest in state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle ever,' campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.\n\nWhile in the state Harris plans to attack Trump for his ties to Project 2025 - an initiative from the Heritage Foundation that promotes conservative polices - and for his position on abortion rights. And while Harris focuses on Georgia, Trump will be focused on breaking the Democrats' blue wall. He's holding a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday - his first visit back to the state since the assassination attempt on him in late June. Harris had surrogates in Pennsylvania on Monday to counter Trump - the state's Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmore. Both Democrats have been names as possible Harris running mates. The Harris campaign also has had surrogates Georgia, as she weighs who to pick as her number two. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who is reported to be a potential running mate, was in in the state on Sunday.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with several other candidates, including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Govs. Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Tim Walz of Minnesota. She is expected to choose her vice presidential candidate by Aug. 7. 'Not yet,' Harris told reporters on Tuesday when asked if she's picked her running mate. Harris' campaign noted it's held some 2,300 organizing events in battleground states this weekend as several high-profile Democrats on her potential VP list stumped for her. With 98 days to go until Election Day, the Harris campaign is touting its fundraising and infrastructure, arguing it is well-positioned to beat Trump in November. The campaign has taken in $200 million since Harris emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week. Over 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Harris is putting it back on the map.", "body": "Harris, struggling to speak over the applause of a crowd her campaign pegged at 10,000, made clear she sees Georgia as key to November victory. And she for the first time mapped out some of her policy priorities -- on immigration, voting rights and gun control -- that Atlantans in interviews this week said they had been eagerly awaiting.\n\n\"I am very clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state,\" Harris said. \"You all helped us win in 2020, and we're going to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nShe also challenged former President Donald Trump to \"meet me on the debate stage\" after he said in an interview with Fox News Channel that ran Monday night that he would \"probably\" debate her -- but \"can also make a case for not doing it.\"\n\n\"As the saying goes: If you got something to say, say it to my face,\" she said to a round of applause from the crowd, which was gathered less than two miles from the TV studio where last month's Biden-Trump debate was held.\n\nHarris' late entry comes after Trump, who lost Georgia by only 11,779 votes in 2020, has made inroads among Black voters, especially younger Black men. But strategists from both parties see a potential for the new Democratic nominee to halt or reverse those trends.\n\n\"It feels like Georgia's re-entered the chat,\" said Stephen Lawson, a veteran GOP strategist here. \"Georgia was not in play for Joe Biden. Georgia is in play for Kamala Harris.\"\n\n\"President Trump has the slight edge, but I think the vice president has quickly cut into that,\" he added.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen voters in downtown Atlanta ahead of Harris' Tuesday rally revealed excitement -- but also doses of uncertainty -- about her candidacy and what she would do if elected president. They suggest that coconut tree memes, brat summer, and the goodwill of Democrats eager for a candidate under the age of 80 -- while helpful in buoying the nascent campaign's fundraising efforts -- will only go so far, and that voters are interested in seeing her policy roadmap and her vice presidential pick before fully committing to her.\n\n\"I want to see what she has to say,\" said ShaDonna Bell, 27, sitting on a park bench in downtown Atlanta. She added that she likes Harris, but the vice president \"still has to earn the vote.\"\n\nTrump has made a significant play for Black voters -- and specifically Black men -- this cycle, with a recent national poll from The New York Times/Siena College showing that while Harris is doing better with voters of color than Biden has all year, Trump continues to outperform his 2020 numbers with them. Trump is set to attend the National Association of Black Journalists' convention in Chicago on Wednesday, and Trump and Vance will be in Georgia on Saturday at the same venue Harris hosted her Tuesday rally.\n\nStill, strategists from both parties questioned whether Trump's support with Black voters is as durable as suggested by polling, which shows him climbing into the upper teens or low 20s after earning only single-digit support in his two previous elections.\n\n\"That's been hard to believe, if I'm being honest. But I wouldn't completely discount it,\" said Howard Franklin, a prominent Black Democratic strategist in Atlanta. \"I think there is an appeal.\"\n\nIn interviews here, some Black voters expressed skepticism about what the Democratic Party has done to support them.\n\n\"What has she done?\" said Kwai Johnson, 56, who voiced concerns about Harris' background as San Francisco district attorney and California state attorney general and said he doesn't feel like she has helped the Black community. \"Really no one has, so I'm not going to hold that against her. I'm just going to hold what she does, and what she did, not what she might do.\"\n\nKwai, who is an assistant engineer at an electronics company, said he's undecided in the election but is leaning toward not voting in the presidential race or voting for a third-party candidate. As a Clinton voter in 2016 and a Biden voter in 2020, he's just the kind of person the Harris campaign thinks it can win back with her at the top of the ticket.\n\nIn a memo last week, campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said that the Biden-Harris swap \"opens up additional persuadable voters who our campaign can work to win the support of,\" like the undecided segment, which are \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30\" and \"are more likely to have supported the Biden-Harris ticket in 2020.\"\n\nDemocrats here argue Biden always had a shot in Georgia, pointing to the significant investment the campaign has made as proof of its seriousness. The campaign Harris has now inherited has 24 field offices and more than 170 coordinated staff, with 2,500 volunteers participating in more than 174 events across the state last weekend.\n\n\"The groundwork was laid early on this year, and the Democrats treated this like a state that they wanted to compete in,\" said Dave Hoffman, spokesperson for the state Democratic Party. \"Georgia's in play. I believed that Georgia was in play prior to all of this.\"\n\nBut her supporters acknowledge the investment Harris has personally made in Georgia, visiting the state now 15 times as vice president.\n\n\"My friends who are not political ... are also super engaged at this point,\" said Franklin, the Democratic strategist in Atlanta. \"Some of that credit belongs to the vice president for having built those inroads or having hosted those house parties or having cultivated relationships. There's definitely a broader phalanx, or constellation, of people who are interested in the outcome.\"\n\nAnd Harris' emergence is energizing younger voters. Ari Adams, 24, said that her Gen-Z friends are now registering to vote and planning to support Harris in November -- and Adams, who had already planned to vote for Biden and has now switched to Harris, said she's thinking about volunteering for Harris' campaign.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of Gen Zs on TikTok saying they registered to vote and are excited to vote. A lot of people my age that weren't going to vote at first are ready to vote,\" Adams said. \"Now with Kamala I'm like, 'Yes, y'all, you got to get out and vote.' I'm so excited to see all the women rallying behind her in all the different Zoom calls -- even the men doing the different Zoom calls and raising money.\"\n\nRepublican strategists admit that Harris' entrance has shaken up the race in Georgia in a way they hadn't thought possible two weeks ago. Shortly after Biden dropped out of the race, Brian Robinson, a longtime GOP strategist in the state, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that swapping in Harris \"will not change the dynamic,\" saying her \"approval numbers are as bad as Biden's.\"\n\nBut in an interview with POLITICO this week, Robinson admitted he was \"somewhat wrong.\" He said she was \"fantastic\" at her first campaign rally in Milwaukee last week, she was \"serious and statesman-like\" in her meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and that she has \"obviously energized and united the party in a way that is fairly remarkable.\"\n\n\"Fourteen days ago, Trump had just been shot, and this thing was over,\" Robinson said.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"},

\"Savage,\" video shows.\n\nThe lyrics of the song, which was released in 2020, include Megan bragging about being \"that b-tch.\"\n\n\"Pussy like water, I'm unbothered and relaxing,\" the artist, 29,

Within 36 hours, Harris announced that she had locked up her party's nomination by landing the verbal backing of a majority of the nearly 4,000 convention delegates.\n\n2024 AD WARS: TRUMP, HARRIS, RACE TO DEFINE THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n\"Freedom is on the ballot this November. That is why I will be in Atlanta tonight with @theestallion to talk about the stakes of this election,\" the vice president wrote in a social media post on her way to Atlanta.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion is expected to perform at the rally, which received nearly 20,000 RSPVs ahead of the event.\n\nThe stop by Harris is a key test of the Democrats' momentum on the ground in the key southeastern battleground state where Biden narrowly edged Trump four years ago.\n\nOnce a red bastion, Georgia has become extremely competitive in presidential, Senate, and gubernatorial elections in recent cycles, thanks in large part to the growing strength of Black and Latino voters, who make up a key party of the Democrats' base in the state.\n\nHOW LONG WILL THE HARRIS 'HONEYMOON' IN THE POLLS LAST?\n\nBut Biden's disastrous performance against Trump at a late June debate against Trump that was held in Atlanta fueled questions about his physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House.\n\nIt also spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the 81-year-old president to end his bid for a second term in the White House.\n\nTrump's edge over Biden in the key battleground states - including Georgia -started to grow in public opinion polling in the wake of the debate.\n\nThe former president is intent on winning back Georgia in November.\n\nAnd hours before Harris arrived in Atlanta, the Trump campaign announced that the former president and his running mate - Sen.

In 2008, Republicans and John McCain's campaign could look at Barack Obama only with envy. And even with Hillary Clinton's historic candidacy in 2016, she did not consistently generate the kind of enthusiastic mass rallies that paved Donald Trump's path to the White House.\n\nGeorgia's Democratic senators work the crowd for Harris\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff called Republican former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, ''strange men with dangerous ideas.'' When he talked about Trump, the crowd briefly chanted, ''Lock him up!''\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock said ''everybody knows that the road to the White House goes through Georgia.'' He added that Trump ''is trying to steal your vote. Kamala Harris is trying to earn your vote.''\n\nWarnock also drew long boos when he recalled Trump recently suggesting that, after November, Christians ''in four years, you don't have to vote again.''\n\nThe Harris campaign says 10,000 people are attending the raucous rally at Georgia State University's Convocation Center. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at the same venue on Saturday.\n\nStacey Abrams amps up the crowd at Harris' Atlanta rally\n\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams is leading off an Atlanta rally for Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, stirring the largest crowd the vice president's nascent bid has attracted since President Joe Biden ended his campaign and endorsed his top lieutenant.\n\nAbrams twice lost governor's races in Georgia but is credited with rebuilding the Democratic Party in the state and paving the way for Biden to carry the state in 2020 and for U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to win tight races that tilted the chamber to Democratic control.\n\n''People discounted Georgia. They dismissed Georgia,'' Abrams said of 2020 forecasts that did not consider the historically conservative state a battleground until late in the campaign. ''They didn't know Georgia.''\n\nAbrams urged the assembly to maintain their enthusiasm and ''not let Donald Trump raze the ground and salt the earth.''\n\n''We watched what happened for four years and we're not going back,'' Abrams said.\n\nGoogle autocomplete results around Trump lead to claims of election interference\n\nWith fewer than 100 days until the 2024 election, social media users are claiming that a lack of Google autocomplete results about former President Donald Trump and his attempted assassination are evidence of election interference.\n\nMany posts include screenshots showing what the autocomplete feature, which predicts what users are trying to type, has generated for text such as ''attempted assassination of tr'' or ''president donald.'' Among the pictured results for the former phrase are references to other assassination attempts, including that of Harry Truman and Gerald Ford, but nothing for Trump. The latter provides two options -- ''president donald duck'' and ''president donald regan.''\n\nIt is true that Google's autocomplete feature as of Monday was not finishing certain phrases related to Trump and the assassination attempt as shown in screenshots spreading online, but there is no evidence it was related to election interference. Completed searches about Trump and the assassination attempt done on both Monday and Tuesday yielded extensive relevant results regardless of what autocomplete predictions came up.\n\nGoogle told the AP that its autocomplete feature has automated protections regarding violent topics, including for searches about theoretical assassination attempts. The company further explained that its systems were out of date even prior to July 13, meaning that the protections already in place couldn't take into account that an actual assassination attempt had occurred.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation says Project 2025 is not going away\n\nProject 2025's website will remain live and the group will continue vetting resumes for its nearly 20,000-person database of potential officials eager to execute its vision for government, the Heritage Foundation said Tuesday.\n\nThe group said project director Paul Dans will leave the Heritage Foundation in August and Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts will now run Project 2025 operations. Roberts has faced criticism in recent weeks after he said on an episode of former Trump aide Steve Bannon's ''War Room'' podcast that the country is in the midst of a ''second American Revolution'' that will be bloodless ''if the left allows it to be.''\n\nEarlier this month, in an interview before beginning a prison sentence for defying a congressional subpoena, Bannon mentioned Roberts as the type of leader who could land a top job in a Trump White House. Roberts has written a book that will be released on Sept. 24 called ''Dawn's Early Light: Taking Back Washington to Save America.'' An advance blurb for the book lists government agencies and outside groups ''that conservatives need to build, others that we need to take back, and more still that are too corrupt to save.''\n\n''All these need to be dissolved if the American way of life is to be passed down to future generations,'' the blurb says. ''The good news is, we're going to win.''\n\nThe author of the foreword to Roberts' book is JD Vance, the Ohio senator Trump picked as his vice presidential running mate.\n\nA speaking invitation from Trump splits the most prominent American group for Black journalists\n\nDonald Trump's invitation to address the National Association of Black Journalists has sparked an intense debate within the organization and a flurry of arguments online.\n\nJournalism organizations for people of color traditionally invite presidential candidates to address their summer gatherings during election years. But Trump's acceptance of NABJ's invitation has led at least one high-profile group member to step down as a convention co-chair and others to argue their convention may become a platform for Trump to make false claims or be seen as winning NABJ's endorsement.\n\nThe debate over NABJ's invite reflects how many journalists are still grappling with how to approach Trump nearly a decade after his first presidential run. Some group members argued journalists should give newsmakers an opportunity to be heard, while others pointed to Trump's demeaning of prominent Black journalists, as well as his frequent falsehoods and attacks on the free press, including labeling reporters ''the enemy of the people.''\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee and first Black woman to hold her office, is not currently scheduled to address the convention. A person familiar with her schedule, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Harris campaign was unable to find a time to appear at NABJ in person and claimed the organization turned down an offer for her to appear virtually.\n\nTop Biden aid leaves White House to join Democratic super PAC\n\nOne of President Joe Biden's top aides is leaving the White House to advise the primary Democratic super PAC supporting Vice President Kamala Harris' bid for the White House, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nAnita Dunn, who has served as a senior adviser in the West Wing and has overseen communications and messaging both at the White House and Biden's former campaign in Delaware, will be taking an advisery role with the group Future Forward, the person said on the condition of anonymity to discuss her plans.\n\nBiden praised Dunn in a statement, saying, ''I deeply value her counsel and friendship and I will continue to rely on her partnership and insights as we finish the job over the next six months.''\n\nDunn and her husband, Biden's personal attorney Bob Bauer, had come under criticism from some Biden allies for their roles in preparing the president for his disastrous June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. Biden's performance sparked a tidal wave of concern within his part over his ability to take on Trump in November that culminated in his decision last Sunday to quit the race and endorse Harris in his stead.\n\nBiden, though, according to another person familiar with the matter, had made clear to Dunn and Bauer that he took responsibility for the debate and didn't blame them.\n\nWith funeral behind them, family of fire chief killed in Trump assassination attempt begins grieving\n\nThe funeral is over. The crowds have left. Now the hard work of grieving is beginning for the family of a former fire chief who was shot and killed during the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.\n\nCorey Comperatore's sister, Dawn Comperatore Schafer, is mad at the scammers trying to collect money on their behalf fraudulently. She is trying to understand how it all happened.\n\nMostly, though, she is shattered. She said the family got through the funeral with the love and support of thousands of people. ''They kept us standing,'' she said. But, she added, it doesn't stop after that. ''The aftermath is just that. You sit with the loss,'' she explained.\n\n''We're hoping the next several weeks coming ahead is when we can really wrap our heads around all of this. We're trying to get out of the noise. And that's very hard to do, as you can imagine. But that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to get out of the noise.''\n\nThe noise has been constant for the Comperatore family from the moment a bullet aimed at Trump killed her 50-year-old baby brother, who was a spectator at the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n''He was there,'' she said of her brother, ''because he loved this country. He wanted his country and the people's lives to improve.''\n\nProject 2025 director leaves Heritage Foundation after Democrat attacks and Trump criticism\n\nThe director of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a vision for a complete overhaul of the federal government, has stepped down according to a spokesperson for the think tank. Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said in a statement the group is sticking to its original timeline and director Paul Dans' exit comes after the project ''completed exactly what it set out to do\" and that the \"tool was built for any future administration to use.''\n\nBut the news came after former President Donald Trump has increasingly disavowed and criticized Project 2025, prompting speculation that his campaign forced the exit.\n\n''President Trump's campaign has been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the President in any way,'' Trump campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement.\n\nMany Trump allies and former top aides contributed to the project, which proposes a mass firing of government employees and sweeping changes to American life. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign and top Democrats have repeatedly tied Trump to Project 2025 as they argue against a second Trump term. A statement from Harris' campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez called Project 2025 Trump's ''agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country.''\n\nKari Lake aims to win GOP primary for closely watched Arizona Senate race\n\nKari Lake is looking to easily win the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Arizona on Tuesday, setting up a fierce battle against Democratic U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nIn Maricopa County, which includes metro Phoenix and 60% of Arizona's voters, Republicans will also choose between a slate of incumbents who have stood up to former President Donald Trump's lies about the 2020 election and challengers who claim it was stolen.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said it will monitor compliance with federal voting rights laws in Maricopa County for Tuesday's primary. County Sheriff's officials told Phoenix radio station KTAR that any attempts to disrupt vote centers, harass poll workers or prevent voting will be punished.\n\nThe primary will give insights about where the narrowly divided state is headed going into the final sprint of the 2024 election, when Arizona is central to the fight for control of the White House and Congress.\n\nDonald Trump to attend Black journalists' convention in Chicago\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is planning to attend the National Association of Black Journalists' annual convention in Chicago on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement released Monday night, the Trump campaign said the Republican presidential nominee would participate in a question and answer session ''that will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.''\n\nTrump's campaign has spent months scheduling appearances in areas outside his traditional strongholds of support, including when he attended -- and was roundly booed at -- the Libertarian Party convention in Washington earlier this year.\n\nIn its announcement, the campaign trumpeted Trump policies that it argued benefited Black Americans during his first term.\n\nHarris pivots to convincing Arab American voters of her leadership\n\nVice President Kamala Harris appears to be trying to convince Arab American voters in crucial Michigan that she is someone they can unite behind. Community leaders are watching closely for signals that she will be more vocal in pressing for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nMany in metro Detroit, home to the nation's largest Muslim population, have expressed a willingness to listen, and some have had initial conversations with Harris' team. Many had grown exasperated with President Joe Biden after they felt months of outreach had not yielded many results.\n\n''The door is cracked open since Biden has stepped down,'' said Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud. ''There's an opportunity for the Democratic nominee to coalesce the coalition that ushered in Biden's presidency four years ago. But that responsibility will now fall on the vice president.''\n\nHarris did not attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent address to Congress, and some Arab American leaders interpret her absence as a sign of good faith with them.\n\nTrump says Harris, married to a Jewish man, doesn't like Jewish people\n\nFormer President Donald Trump said in a radio interview Tuesday that Vice President Kamala Harris, who is married to a Jewish man, ''doesn't like Jewish people'' and appeared to agree with a radio host who called second gentleman Doug Emhoff ''a crappy Jew.''\n\nTrump, speaking on radio station WABC, claimed Harris looked uncomfortable while meeting last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n''You can see the disdain,'' he said. ''No. 1, she doesn't like Israel. No. 2, she doesn't like Jewish people. You know it, I know it and everybody knows it, and nobody wants to say it.''\n\nThe Republican former president then said, ''If you're Jewish, if you vote for a Democrat, you're a fool, an absolute fool. They have let Jewish people down since Obama at a level that nobody could believe.''\n\nAs the interview went on, Trump again said Harris ''dislikes Jewish people.'' The interview host, Sid Rosenberg, then mentioned Emhoff and said, ''He's Jewish like Bernie Sanders is Jewish. Are you kidding me?''\n\nRosenberg went on, saying of Emhoff, ''He's a horrible Jew.''\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said, ''America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump. Vice President Harris believes Americans want a president who unites our country instead of divides it, uses the power of the presidency to help families instead of hurt them, and has a vision for our future, instead of taking us backwards.''\n\nHarris' potential running mates walk a fine line\n\nDemocratic governors and other officials under consideration to be Democrat Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate are practicing a time-honored tradition in presidential campaigns. They're walking the line between open self-promotion and loyal advocacy for the potential boss in what amounts to unofficial auditions.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro campaigned for Harris on Monday outside Philadelphia. He blasted Republican former President Donald Trump and called Harris ready to lead. But he also showcased his own accomplishments.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear took a similar approach over the weekend. He told voters in Georgia that Harris has the makings of ''a great president,\" and then highlighted the elections he has won as a Democrat in Republican territory.\n\nHarris is said to also be considering Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, among others.\n\nSecret Service head, FBI's No. 2 grilled by Senate lawmakers\n\nThe acting director of the Secret Service said Tuesday he ''cannot defend'' why the roof used by the gunman in the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump was not secured.\n\nRonald Rowe, testifying before two Senate committees, said that he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site where Trump had been holding a campaign rally, and that ''what I saw made me ashamed.''\n\nRowe was joined at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official said a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nTrump plans rally at same Georgia venue as Harris event\n\nRepublican Donald Trump's campaign announced Tuesday, hours ahead of a rally planned by Vice President Kamala Harris at Georgia State University, that he will travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue.\n\nDemocrats say they have new hope for winning Georgia in November after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris. They're betting that a fresh burst of energy and a surge in fundraising has helped make Georgia -- the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020 -- a toss-up again.\n\nThe Harris campaign and Georgia Democratic officials have 24 offices across the state, including two added last weekend in metro Atlanta. Trump and the Republican National Committee opened their first Georgia offices only recently.\n\nTrump ad blasts Harris for problems at the border\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump's campaign released a new advertisement Tuesday, blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for problems at the U.S. southern border.\n\nThe advertisement dubs Harris the ''border czar,'' a reference to her work on migration issues. It includes a parade of headlines about drugs and criminals entering the country, as well as a clip from a controversial interview that Harris did three years ago in which she brushed off a suggestion that she would visit the border.\n\n''Failed. Weak. Dangerously liberal,'' the advertisement brands Harris.\n\nNew $50 million ad portrays Harris as 'fearless'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign is kickstarting a $50 million advertising campaign with a new television spot calling the likely Democratic presidential nominee ''fearless'' throughout her career.\n\n''Throughout her career as a courtroom prosecutor, attorney general, United States senator, and now as vice president, Kamala Harris has always stood up to bullies, criminals and special interests on behalf of the American people - and she's beaten them,'' said a statement from Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair.\n\n''She's uniquely suited to take on Donald Trump, a convicted felon who has spent his entire life ripping off working people, tearing away our rights, and fighting for himself.''\n\nThe advertisement is slated to run during the Olympics, ''The Bachelorette,'' ''The Daily Show'' and other popular programs. It's an attempt to even the score with Republicans, who have been outspending Democrats on the airwaves during a chaotic summer when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion to campaign for Harris\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion will join Vice President Kamala Harris for a special performance during her campaign stop in Atlanta on Tuesday.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson confirmed the hip-hop star's performance alongside the vice president in a post on X on Monday night.\n\nThe Harris campaign is promising a large rally in Atlanta, on par with the large events that Republican former President Donald Trump has made his signature.\n\nHarris has America focused on multiracial identity\n\nIf Vice President Kamala Harris were to ascend to the presidency, she would become the first female president, but also one who is also multiracial.\n\nThe daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, both of whom immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement, Harris' historic presidential bid has again put a spotlight on American identity politics and the growing number of people who say they are multiracial.\n\nDifferent countries divide people into categories depending on different national traditions. The U.S., with its slavery-molded history, divides people into Black or white, and nine million people identified as multiracial in 2010.\n\nWhen Harris ran for vice president in 2020, 33.8 million people in the U.S. identified as being more than one race, according to the census.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The White House and campaign remain adamant she is responsible for addressing the root causes of migration and is not Biden's \"border czar.\"\n\n\"In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week -- any day of the week, including, for example, on the issue of immigration,\" Harris said.\n\n\"I was the attorney general of a border state,\" she added. \"Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.\"\n\nDespite the bravado, Harris underscored former President Barack Obama's message in his endorsement of her last week, that she is an underdog before November's election.\n\n\"Let's level set,\" she said. \"We have a fight in front of us.\"\n\nHarris was introduced by Atlanta-born rapper and singer Quavo, with a special performance by fellow rapper Megan Thee Stallion.\n\n\"I know my ladies in the crowd love their bodies,\" Megan Thee Stallion said before she started performing her new song, \"Body.\" \"If you want to keep loving your body, you know who to vote for.\"\n\nAlthough the vibe of Harris's rally was in stark contrast to any of its Biden counterparts, her message was remarkably similar to that of the man she replaced on the 2024 Democratic ticket last week and is hoping to replace in the White House next year, including encouraging people to sit down before she started speaking.\n\n\"By many indicators our economy is the strongest in the world.

She pointed out that it was Trump who tanked a bipartisan immigration bill that would have provided new funding for Border Patrol agents and tightened asylum rules because it would hurt Trump's efforts to regain the White House.\n\n\"Donald Trump does not care about border security, he only cares about himself,\" she said, adding that as president, she would push that same legislation through Congress and sign it into law, \"and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like.\"\n\nHarris's stump speech hit themes familiar to Democrats. Restoring abortion rights, protecting the Affordable Care Act, favoring economic policies that benefit middle-class people over the wealthy, and defending American democracy have been staples of President Joe Biden's message since the 2020 campaign.\n\nBut Harris has -- at least for now -- infused those messages with an energy level not seen in a Democratic national ticket since President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection.\n\nKarl Bryant, a Black 71-year-old retiree wearing an Obama T-shirt from 2008 who recalled crying with joy at an election watch party that November, said Harris is already matching the enthusiasm that Obama had that year. \"Even more so, because she's got the women on her side,\" he said.\n\nFormer Georgia state representative Howard Mosby, 63, said that while Biden won Georgia in 2020 with a low-key campaign, he feared that Black voters did not seem as motivated to vote this time. \"I think apathy was going to be the killer,\" he said, adding that that attitude changed overnight 10 days earlier when Biden ended his campaign and endorsed Harris. \"OK, now we've got a candidate.\"\n\nTo defeat Trump in 2020, Biden was able to win five states that Trump had carried in 2016: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia. Democrats had typically won the first three -- the so-called \"Blue Wall\" states -- for a generation in presidential elections, while Arizona and Georgia had traditionally been won by the Republican nominee.\n\nGeorgia, Arizona and Wisconsin had seen the tightest margins, all under single percentage points with Biden winning Georgia by just 11,779 votes.\n\nStrategists for the Biden campaign, which effectively became the Harris campaign after he dropped out on July 21, had focused on the midwestern states, where he was polling closer to Trump than the Sun Belt states.\n\nHarris' visit Tuesday suggests that the campaign sees Georgia and its 16 electoral votes as a plausible target for November.\n\nTrump, who handily won the Republican nomination despite four separate criminal indictments against him, announced after Harris' rally was scheduled that he would stage a rally in Atlanta at the same venue Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Cardi B, another high-profile rapper, has also defended Harris against \"disgusting\" sexist attacks.\n\nHarris has been gaining momentum in her campaign, particularly among younger voters. She recently joined TikTok and made a cameo in a post by Lance Bass referencing *NSYNC's \"Bye, Bye, Bye\". Her campaign has also been quick to jump on endorsements from popular culture, including a recent partnership with Charli XCX, who declared \"Kamala IS brat\" on X (formerly Twitter).", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pop_culture@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Pop Culture", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65th_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "65th Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardi B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_Bye_Bye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bye Bye Bye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSYNC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NSYNC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Bass", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lance Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charli XCX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Kamala-and-Megan1722318756-0/Kamala-and-Megan1722318756-0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774352", "eventUri": "eng-9774352", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Lock him up!\" in a reprise of the chants Trump supporters aimed at Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in 2016.\n\nHarris also took on Trump on the issue of immigration, accusing the former president of intervening to kill immigration reform legislation that had the backing of Democrats and even conservative Republicans.\n\n\"He tanked the bipartisan bill because he thought it would help him win an election,\" she said. \"Donald Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee, responding to Harris' visit to Georgia, turned the tables on the immigration issue, accusing Harris of failing to solve the problem in her role as \"immigration czar\" for the Biden administration.\n\n\"If she really cared about Georgia, she would end the border bloodbath that led to the brutal murder of Laken Riley, who was killed at the University of Georgia,\" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said. \"A vote for dangerously pro-criminal Kamala is a vote for another four years of soft on crime and open border policies that are making our communities around the country less safe.\"\n\nHarris chastised Trump for waffling over a previous commitment to a second debate in September, a pledge he made back when the presumptive Democratic nominee was Biden, who Trump trounced in the first debate last month in Atlanta. She noted that Trump and Republican running mate J.D. Vance have been highly critical of her.\n\n\"As the saying goes, 'If you've got something to say, say it to my face,' \" she said, addressing Trump directly.\n\nHarris acknowledged that she's the underdog in the race, even though she has pulled closer to Trump in Georgia and a handful of other battleground states since Biden abandoned the campaign.\n\n\"We have our work cut out for us,\" she told the crowd. \"But when we fight, we win!\"\n\nGeorgia will remain the focus of the presidential contest as July turns to August.

Prices were still too high, she said, despite cooling inflation.\n\n\"Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,\" she said, promising to attack hidden fees, rent increases and prescription drug costs.\n\nHarris pledged to pass new protections for voting rights and reproductive freedoms and promised to tackle continued gun violence.\n\nAnd Harris called on Trump to recommit to a debate before the election.\n\n\"As the saying goes -- if you've got something to say, say it to my face,\" she said.\n\nGeorgia in play\n\nHarris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon recently said the campaign's strategy would focus on winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- but she also said Georgia represented an opportunity to reach new voters, particularly those who were \"disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30.\"\n\nIn the 2020 election, Joe Biden eked out a victory in Georgia by less than half a percentage point. Trump and 18 co-defendants have been indicted by a Fulton County grand jury for attempting to overturn the results.\n\nTrump said he planned to hold a rally in the same arena on Saturday.", "source":

But it's not just the politics that had people rushing to downtown Atlanta.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion announced to her 32.3 million Instagram followers on Monday that she would perform in support of the vice president. The artist was set to go on stage following Harris' remarks at 7 p.m.\n\nJoy Trinidad, 23, was already excited to support Harris at Tuesday's rally before learning that Megan Thee Stallion would perform. But after seeing that her favorite artist was coming out, Trinidad said she had a new mantra: \"Hotties for Harris!\"\n\nHarris is having a 'brat girl summer'\n\nHarris' rebrand from vice president to the official \"brat\" at the top of the Democratic ticket was swift and powerful. In the hours after President Joe Biden announced that he would step down from the 2024 race, Harris was receiving endorsements from the likes of Charlie XCX.\n\n\"Kamala IS brat,\" the popular singer posted to X, formerly Twitter.\n\nCharli XCX described the meaning of \"brat\" to be \"that girl who is a little messy and likes to party. ... Who feels herself but maybe also has a breakdown ... is very honest, very blunt, a little bit volatile.\"\n\nConsider Charlie XCX's endorsement a golden - or lime green - ticket to the youth vote. Her record \"Brat\" has topped the charts since its release on June 7, with Gen Z and younger millennials quickly declaring it the album of the summer.\n\nHarris' team seized upon the moment. The campaign's official X account switched out their header image to display \"Kamala HQ\" in the same font and style as the album.\n\nUnderstanding the youth vote\n\nThe ability to tap into these cultural moments - ones that exist almost exclusively online, their viral ascension a flash in the pan before inevitably becoming cringe - is a new benchmark for younger voters. Forget whether a voter can \"grab a beer\" with a candidate. What's their internet content like?\n\nHarris and her team appear poised to leverage this understanding of a younger demographic to their advantage.\n\nHer star-studded lineup of supporters, from Charlie XCX to Megan Thee Stallion, speaks to her media savvy that even her predecessor didn't seem to fully grasp. Try as Biden might with his Dark Brandon memes, they didn't hit in the same way as \"brat\" and \"#Hotties4Harris.\"\n\nBut for the attendees of the rally, it wasn't just about Harris' celebrity endorsements. They felt she understood them better as voters.\n\nTrinidad has felt \"very hopeful\" since Harris took over the Democratic ticket.\n\n\"Up until this point in politics, I've been very pessimistic about how things were going,\" she said. \"But once Biden dropped out and Kamala announced that she was running, I became very optimistic about her policies. It seems that she's going in the right direction.\"\n\nSupporters also said they more closely identify with Harris, as the first Black and Asian woman to likely lead a major party ticket. She is also the first woman, Black person, or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president.\n\nCody Bass, 28, said he was \"ecstatic\" about Harris' campaign so far. \"Growing up in the Deep South, I've been inspired and really raised by strong Black women like Kamala. To see her take on this candidacy and take the high road against Donald Trump, I'm really pumped about that.\"\n\nOthers felt that Harris was the best person to take on the issues that matter most to them.\n\n\"I'm feeling very hopeful,\" said 27-year-old Shambria Stoll. \"As a woman, I'm hoping Kamala brings me back the rights to my body. I think she'll do it.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.savannahnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Savannah Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charli XCX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trinidad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trinidad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Atlanta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Brewery", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bass Brewery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deep South"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Tickets", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets_For_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets For Shows", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/23/USAT/74186634007-gty-2158693779.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1199,675,x0,y48&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774352", "eventUri": "eng-9774352", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1436, "textEnd": 1442}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

In her first big rally, the Vice President called out the three time Republican presidential candidate to keep his word about the ABC News-hosted debate set for September 10 that he had previously agreed to do against Biden.\n\n\"So, the momentum in this race is shifting, and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it,\" the Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee told an enthusiastic crowd of over 10,000 just now in Atlanta as polls have Harris tied and even ahead of Trump a week into her White House bid. 'So, last week you may have seen, he pulled out of the debate in September he had previously agreed to,\" Harris added to laughs from the Georgia audience.\n\nMocking Trump as a chicken and the rhetoric from Trump and running mate Sen J.D. Vance (R-OH) as \"just plain weird,\" Harris put her opponent on notice to the world with the political equivalent of a sidewinder.\n\n\"Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,\" the VP said with maximum precision. \"As the saying goes, if you got something to say, say it to my face!\"\n\nWith Megan Thee Stallion, Stacey Abrams, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, and senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in attendance, the crowd at the Georgia State Convocation Center went nuts.\n\nThat reaction to Harris' challenge was seen live on CNN and MSNBC, as well as the BBC. However, if you were watching the MAGA friendly Fox News you would have seen none of it. Over on the Rupert Murdoch-owned outlet Laura Ingraham was slamming law enforcement for its investigation into the social media accounts of Thomas Crooks, the 21-year-old who tried to shoot Trump at a rally in Butler, PA on July 13.\n\nThe Fox host also had more of her pre-recorded sit-down with Trump. An interview where on Monday Trump was shown telling Ingraham that he \"probably\" meet up with Harris in the fall, but he \"can also make a case for not doing it.\" When Ingraham tried to press Trump on getting in the ring with Harris, the ex-Celebrity Apprentice host replied he didn't want to \"reward fake news\" like ABC or make them \"rich.\"\n\nIf it's unsure if Trump will go face-to-face with Harris in a month, it is sure that he will be in the Georgia State Convocation Center this weekend for a rally of his own. Whether he packs 'em in like Harris did remains to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dominic_patten@deadline.com", "name": "Dominic Patten", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stacey Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ingraham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laura Ingraham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

She also accused him of being 'all talk'. In his bid to make immigration a priority. She used a line made famous by the Migos rapper to hit that point home.\n\nHer comments - aside from drawing on her background as California's state attorney general - appeared to come in reference to a recent ad being run by Trump's team, which focuses on Harris's questionable record when it comes immigration.\n\nBranded a failed 'Border Czar', Harris went on to slam Trump's hesitance to debate as 'weird' - the most recent anti-GOP mantra being used as of late.\n\nShe also referenced how Trump has called her 'crazy' and a 'bum' - criticisms she said would be better made face-to-face.\n\nScroll down for video:\n\n'I do hope you'll reconsider to [meeting] me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face,' Harris, 59, said shortly after taking the podium.\n\nShe went on to express her desire to win come November and unite the country in the process, while framing her conservative rival as a phony who 'does not care.'\n\nShe did this by leaning into her background as an attorney general, and was quick to remind onlookers she served in a border state.\n\n'I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally,' the former California AG said\n\n'I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,' she continued.\n\n'Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.\n\n'Or as my friend Quavo would say, he's not walking it like he talks it,' she quickly added, in reference to the rapper's 2018 hit.\n\nTo prove her point, Harris pointed to the prospective pressure Trump put on his Republican allies within the senate this past January, when he told them to kill any border legislation that wasn't 'perfect.'\n\nAt the time, many believed the decision was made to hinder the current commander-in-chief's biggest chance at reelection if the plan fell apart - which it inevitably did.\n\nMoreover, the bill had been a compromise, drafted by Republicans and Democrats over the course of several months only to be tossed.\n\n'He tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election, which goes to show Donald Trump does not care about border security,' Harris said in response.\n\n'He only cares about himself,' she further claimed, vowing to revive the bipartisan border bill if elected.\n\nAside from claiming Trump obliquely had the bipartisan border bill killed just to make Joe Biden look bad, Harris kept honing in on Trump's apparent reluctance to meet her in the proverbial ring.\n\nWith the election less than 100 days away, Trump had initially agreed to debate Harris, but more recently questioned the value of such a meetup as he remains ahead in most polls.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News that aired Monday, the candidate was pressed several times about committing, before giving a more free-form answer than he had in recent days.\n\n'I want to do a debate,' he told Laura Ingraham.\n\n'But I also can say this. Everybody knows who I am. And now people know who she is.'\n\nHe eventually said, 'The answer is yes, I'll probably end up debating.'\n\nThis prompted Harris's campaign to brand the firebrand 'scared', an ode to his own open criticisms of fellow candidates on the debate stages back in 2015 and 2016.\n\nWhen Harris brought this up, and how Trump had pulled out for a debate slated for September, the crowd booed.\n\n'So he won't debate but he and his running mate have a lot to say about me,' she told onlookers, before offering her party's latest pandering buzzword after others - and trends on TikTok - failed to stick.\n\n'And, by the way, don't you find some of their stuff to be just plain weird,' she said, before being met with uproarious applause.\n\nThe simple descriptor has become the new line of criticism against Republicans, and aside from being concise, it has resonated with Harris supporters.\n\nIt has also successfully framed divisive figures like JD Vance as not being the most privy to the needs - and fads - of young people.\n\nThe Ohio junior senator has received a lambasting after saying political leaders who didn't have biological children 'don't really have a direct stake' in the country.\n\nThere were 10,000 people cheering on the vice president as she trudged on in the Georgia State Convocation Center, trying desperately to bring the state of Georgia to her corner.\n\n'I am very clear. The path to the White House runs right through this state. We did it in 2020 and we're going to do it again in 2024,' she said, before rattling off her resume as a prosecutor, district attorney and attorney general of California.\n\n'In those roles I took on perpetrators of all kinds, predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain so hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type,' she said.\n\n'And I have been dealing with people like him my entire career.'\n\n'Lock him up, lock him up,' the crowd demanded in response, their feet ponding on the bleachers.\n\nAhead of those remarks, a bevy of top Democrats in the state fired up the crowd, repeatedly reminding the attendees about Trump's attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia in the 2020 election.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion was one of the first, telling onlookers 'We're about to make history with the first female president. The first black female president. Let's get this done honey.\n\nShe went on to sing 'Girls in the Hood,' 'Mamushi,' and 'Savage', and before her performance of 'Body', she told the crowd: 'Now I know my ladies in the crowd love their bodies\n\n'Iif you want to keep loving your body, you know who to vote for.'\n\nStacey Abrams, who has been one of Harris' most ardent defenders, was next, and received a standing ovation and shouts of 'Stacey' when she came out. Abrams, in turn, had the crowd shout 'Kamala, Kamala.'\n\nShe described Harris as someone who 'break barriers' in the White House, and noted how, in Georgia, 'we do the job of changing America and we're going to do it again.'\n\nBut it was Georgia's two Democratic senators - who handed the party control of the Senate - that reminded the crowd of Trump's actions in the last presidential race.\n\nSenator Jon Ossoff told the crowd: 'Apparently Donald Trump is too scared to debate Vice President Karris.'\n\nHe added that the candidate who is too scared is the 'candidate who is losing.'\n\n'Too scared,' the crowd yelled. 'Too scared.'\n\nOssoff also talked about Trump's attempts to overturn the election results in Georgia.\n\n'Lock him up, lock him up,' the crowd yelled.\n\nAnd Senator Raphael Warnock emphasized the state's importance in the race for the White House.\n\n'Everyone knows the road to the White House goes through Georgia,' he said.\n\nHe noted others know it. 'As a matter of fact I heard a phone call. A Florida man, called into Georgia and said I need 11,000 votes,' he said, referring to Trump's phone call to the state's secretary of state in 2020.\n\nThe crowd roared with laughter and applause.\n\n'Georgia - Donald Trump tried to steal your vote. Kamala Harris is trying to earn your vote,' Warnock said.\n\nQuavo also addressed the crowd, speaking about high rates of gun violence.\n\nThe border is one of the biggest vulnerabilities for the vice president. Her team has argued she was not in charge of border security but of handling the root causes of migration.\n\nThe rally was Harris' largest campaign rally to date. It marks her first appearance in Georgia since she locked up the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nTrump and Vance will hold a campaign rally in Atlanta together on Saturday August 3, the Trump campaign announced on Tuesday.\n\nIt will be held in the same location as Harris' rally.\n\nGeorgia played a crucial role in the last presidential election, and it is expected to be just as significant this November. According to several polls released last week, it's a virtual toss-up between Harris and Trump.\n\nPolls showed Joe Biden trailed Trump significantly in the state but Harris does much better against the former president.\n\nShe outperforms Biden among young people, Black voters, and Hispanic voters, key demographics that could decide swing states like Georgia and Arizona.\n\nBiden only won the state by some 12,000 votes in 2020, a win heavily contested by Trump, who is currently in the midst of an election interference case in the state\n\nGeorgia is a top focus with less than 100 days to go before the election.\n\nThe Harris campaign noted it has 24 offices open in the state nd 170 staffers on the ground there.\n\n'In Georgia, we're running the largest in state operation of any Democratic presidential campaign cycle ever,' campaign communications director Michael Tyler said.\n\nWhile in the state Harris plans to attack Trump for his ties to Project 2025 - an initiative from the Heritage Foundation that promotes conservative polices - and for his position on abortion rights.\n\nAnd while Harris focuses on Georgia, Trump will be focused on breaking the Democrats' blue wall.\n\nHe's holding a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday - his first visit back to the state since the assassination attempt on him in late June.\n\nHarris had surrogates in Pennsylvania on Monday to counter Trump - the state's Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmore. Both Democrats have been names as possible Harris running mates.\n\nThe Harris campaign also has had surrogates Georgia, as she weighs who to pick as her number two.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who is reported to be a potential running mate, was in in the state on Sunday.\n\nThe Harris campaign is vetting him along with several other candidates, including Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Govs. Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Tim Walz of Minnesota.\n\nShe is expected to choose her vice presidential candidate by Aug. 7.\n\n'Not yet,' Harris told reporters on Tuesday when asked if she's picked her running mate.\n\nHarris' campaign noted it's held some 2,300 organizing events in battleground states this weekend as several high-profile Democrats on her potential VP list stumped for her.\n\nWith less than 100 days to go until Election Day, the Harris campaign is touting its fundraising and infrastructure, arguing it is well-positioned to beat Trump in November.\n\nThe campaign has taken in $200 million since Harris emerged as the likely Democratic presidential nominee last week.\n\nOver 170,000 volunteers have also signed up to help the Harris campaign with phone banking, canvassing and other get-out-the-vote efforts.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Some 10,000 supporters had lined up hours before to see the vice president facing heat and Georgia's infamous summer storms.\n\nOnce inside the arena, a procession of Georgia's political heavyweights took the stage in support of Harris, including Atlanta Major Andre Dickens, former Democratic candidate for governor Stacey Abrams, and Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.\n\nSongs spanning musical genres - from Whitney Houston to Migos - blasted through the speakers. The crowd, energized by a fresh campaign, danced with signs that simply read \"KAMALA.\" Megan Thee Stallion hit the stage right before Harris, performing in a bright blue pantsuit to her top hits \"Mamushi\" and \"Body.\"\n\nThe packed arena erupted into applause as Harris walked out to Beyonce's 2016 song \"Freedom.\" But Harris was all business upon taking the stage, marking her 15th visit to Georgia since taking office and her first to the battleground state as the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\n\"As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, and before I was elected a United States senator ... I was a courtroom prosecutor,\" Harris said. \"So in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds; predators who broke the rules for their own game.\"\n\nShe went on to discuss her time as attorney general for California.\n\n\"As attorney general, I held the big Wall Street banks accountable for fraud,\" Harris said. \"Donald Trump was just found guilty of fraud. Through this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day.\"\n\nHarris also staunchly defended the record of the Biden-Harris administration, focusing on its immigration policies and stance on border security.\n\nShe dismissed the attacks that have dogged her about being Biden's \"border czar.\" Harris described walking through underground tunnels with Border Patrol agents to help catch - and ultimately prosecute - drug dealers and members of cartels during her time as attorney general of a border state.\n\nHarris also issued a challenge to Trump, demanding he face her on the debate stage. Trump previously said he will not commit to debating Harris because he's not sure she'll be the nominee.\n\nThe crowd broke out into cheers when Harris delivered what was likely her best received line of the night: \"I do hope you'll reconsider and meet me on the debate stage, because, as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face!\"\n\nMelissa Cruz is an elections reporting fellow who focuses on voter access issues for the USA TODAY Network.

Donald Trump, Donald Trump on the other hand has been talking a big game about securing our border but he does not walk the walk or, as my friend Quavo would say, he does not walk it like he talks it,\" she said, quoting the rapper who spoke before her at the rally.\n\nShe noted that Republicans in the Senate blocked passage of that bill twice after the former president urged the GOP to oppose the legislation, suggesting it could give Biden an election year win.\n\n\"Which goes to show, Donald Trump does not care about border security, he only cares about himself,\" she said. \"When I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem.\"\n\n\"As president I will bring back the border security bill that Donlad Trump killed and I will sign it into law and show Donald Trump what real leadership looks like,\" she added.\n\nAfter the bill that Biden actively lobbied for failed, the president issued an executive order to turn away migrants seeking asylum who cross the southern border illegally at times when there is a high volume of daily encounters.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Harris campaign released a new video on the border, hitting back at Trump after his campaign debuted an ad tagging Harris the Biden administration's \"border czar,\" a reference to her work addressing root causes of migration in the Northern Triangle region.\n\nHarris also told the crowd in Atlanta that \"prices are still too high\" and outlined what she would do to lower them, saying that \"on Day One,\" she would implement policies like curbing price gouging, banning more hidden fees, capping \"unfair\" rent increases and capping prescription drug prices for all Americans.\n\nHer economic plans largely line up with Biden's campaign promises when he was running for reelection and much of it, especially the work to crack down on hidden fees, is an extension of what the Biden administration has done to combat inflation.\n\nAdditionally, the vice president said as president that she would pass voting rights bills, including the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Georgia has been the epicenter of controversial election policies after Gov. Brian Kemp (R) passed a law in 2021 that prohibits the distribution of food or water to voters waiting to cast their ballots, among other restrictions.\n\nTwo of the most popular Black rappers, Quavo and Megan Thee Stallion, took the stage before Harris and urged rally-goers to show up in November.\n\nGrammy award-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion performed a medley of some of her top hits -- including \"Body\" and \"Savage.\" In her intro to \"Body,\" she alluded to Harris's stance on reproductive freedom, saying, \"I know my ladies in the crowd love their body. If you wanna keep loving your body, you know who to vote for.\"\n\n\"We're about to make history with our first female president,\" she said. \"Our first Black female president.\"\n\nQuavo, an Atlanta-native and member of the hip hop group Migos, noted that he had previously worked with Harris to address gun violence, adding, \"one thing I learned about working with Vice President is she always stands on business.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_gangitano@thehill.com", "name": "Alex Gangitano", "type": "author",

I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,\" she said.\n\nBy contrast, Harris said Trump \"has been talking a big game about securing our border\" but \" does not walk the walk.\"\n\n\"Our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, DC supported the bill, even the Border Patrol endorsed it,\" she said as she recalled how the bill had been \"all set to pass\" before Trump \"directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down.\"\n\n\"He tanked, tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election,\" she said, adding that she would push a Democratic congress to enact the same bill to law when she is in the White House as president.\n\nIn response, the crowd roared with approval.\n\nThe vice president's appearance at the raucous Atlanta rally demonstrated the massive shift in culture and enthusiasm that has swept through the Democratic Party in the nine days since President Biden shocked the world by announcing that he would become the first American president to stand down from seeking a second term since Lyndon Johnson did so amid the upheaval from the Vietnam War in 1968.\n\nBiden's campaign appearances were usually daytime affairs hosted by labor unions or other Democratic-leaning groups, or nighttime fundraisers with audiences limited to smaller groups of donors and video footage tightly controlled by his campaign apparatus.\n\nBut since becoming the party's de facto nominee last week, Harris has returned to the packed rallies that characterized Democratic campaigns before the Covid-19 pandemic upended the 2020 election cycle, with star-studded guest lists reminiscent of Barack Obama's first campaign for the presidency in 2008.\n\nBy the time she took the stage at the Georgia State Convocation Center, the stands had been packed to the rafters. They were warmed up by Peach State Democratic mainstays, including former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and Georgia's two Democratic senators, Jon Ossoff and Rev Raphael Warnock.\n\nAfter Thee Stallion performed to cheers from rallygoers, Atlanta-area rapper Quavo praised Harris for her work on addressing gun violence, calling the vice president someone who \"always stands on business.\"\n\nBut the cheers both musicians received paled in comparison to the ovation Harris got when she took the stage to Beyonce's \"Freedom\" and launched into her remarks.\n\nIn what has become a standard part of her stump speech, she warned that Trump wants to implement a \"Project 2025\" agenda that would \"cut Social Security and Medicare,\" as well as \"give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations\" and \"gut the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\n\"America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not going back.,\" she said.\n\n\"We're not going back, because ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history. And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do,\" she said.\n\nBut Harris also challenged Trump on his recent decision to waffle on whether to debate her at the September 10 presidential debate set to air on ABC.\n\nShe said Trump's decision was because \"the momentum in this race is shifting\" and called the move a \"sign that Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\n\"Here's the funny thing about that. So he won't debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me,\" she added, drawing laughs when she asked if the crowd finds her opponents \"just plain weird.\"\n\nSpeaking to Trump directly, Harris challenged him to show up and confront her.\n\n\"Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes: If you got something to say, you should say it to my face.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_in_the_Hood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Girls in the Hood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Beyonc\u00e9, who joined Harris on her \"Savage\" remix, permitted Harris to use the song \"Freedom\" in her walk-out music as well as in the first advertisement for the campaign. Her \"WAP\" costar Cardi B also supported Harris, defending her against \"disgusting\" sexist attacks.\n\nHarris, who stepped up as the potential presidential nominee after Joe Biden withdrew his reelection campaign last Sunday, stirred up immediate online support after Charli XCX declared that \"Kamala IS brat\" on X (formerly Twitter), referring to the hip culture surrounding her sixth album \"Brat.\" Harris' campaign was quick to jump on the endorsement, changing the header for their X profile to resemble the slime green color featured on the cover of \"Brat.\"\n\nHarris appears to be leaning into Gen Z and millennial culture, as she most recently joined TikTok and made a cameo in a Lance Bass post referencing *NSYNC's \"Bye, Bye, Bye.\"", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Perry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Katy Perry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65th_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "65th Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamour_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glamour (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAP_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WAP (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardi B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_Bye_Bye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bye Bye Bye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSYNC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NSYNC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Bass", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lance Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charli XCX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2158693779-e1722301208813.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774352", "eventUri": "eng-9774352", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Democratic Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock will also attend.\n\nThe possibility of Democrats winning in the battleground state was a stretch one month ago, but some analysts now believe a new face on top of the ticket and a fresh burst of energy may change everything.\n\nMs Harris replaced Mr Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee after the president announced he was withdrawing from the race.\n\n\"It has been a reset button in so many ways,\" Amy Morton, the CEO of Georgia-based consulting firm Southern Majority, told the BBC.\n\n\"It completely changed the landscape of Georgia.\"\n\nSwing states like Georgia, which Mr Biden won by the narrowest margin in 2020, are fiercely contested because they can lean either to Republicans or Democrats and play a decisive role in presidential elections.\n\nIt's a state Republicans are looking to flip back red.\n\nDonald Trump will also be campaigning in Atlanta on Saturday - at the same venue as Ms Harris - to cement his support in the swing state.\n\nCongressman Hank Jackson, a Georgia Democrat, told BBC News an \"explosion of enthusiasm has been unleashed\" since Ms Harris stepped up as the nominee.\n\nHe pointed to how Ms Harris has been devoted to uplifting different demographics, which resonates specifically among Georgia voters.\n\n\"All demographics are positively activated by her candidacy,\" Mr Jackson said.\n\nDemocrats in Georgia depend heavily on strong turnout among black voters, a state with one of the highest African American populations in the country.\n\nPolls were suggesting that the state was drifting away from Mr Biden, University of Georgia Professor Charles Bullock told BBC News.\n\nThe state is on Ms Harris's \"watch list\", he added, noting she has made more than a dozen visits.\n\nIn a campaign strategy memo, Harris campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon listed Georgia as one of several Sun Belt states - as well as North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada - where the campaign plans to focus efforts ahead of November.\n\nBefore Mr Biden dropped from the race, Ms Morton, a Democratic political consultant in Georgia, said she was concerned about voter turnout, finding many throughout Georgia to be less engaged than when they broke records in 2020.\n\nBut now \"that's changed completely\", she says.\n\n\"We've gone back into all of our planning to calculate for higher turnout because enthusiasm on the ground is so much more apparent than it was in the beginning of June.\"\n\nMs Morton said she's seen upticks in volunteer signups and social media engagement for down ballot candidates too since Ms Harris entered the race.\n\nDoes Harris put Georgia in Democrat reach?\n\nRecent polling shows Ms Harris leads Trump by one point - 43% to 42% - among registered voters nationwide, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey.\n\nMs Morton said she though those margins would only increase, specifically among Georgia voters.\n\nBut there is still strong support for Trump in the state.\n\nMs Harris could face attacks over handling the crisis at the southern border as vice-president. Although Georgia is far removed, the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student allegedly killed by a Venezuelan who had entered the US illegally, made the issue of immigration more important to Georgian voters.\n\nMr Bullock said Trump, too, must be careful in his messaging to Georgian voters. His personal attacks on Ms Harris - and not on her policies - could alienate female voters who find him offensive, he said.\n\nTrump's allies have attacked Ms Harris's background, claiming she was a \"DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) hire\".\n\nMs Harris could also gain ground in the state by appealing to a significant group of establishment Republican voters who are less sold on Trump.\n\n\"There is a share of them - and these would be white college educated voters - who maybe find Trump offensive, they may not have liked the chaos of his administration, they may not like his misogyny,\" Mr Bullock said.\n\nMore on US election:", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madeline_halpert@ca.news.yahoo.com", "name":

The California liberal of little notable accomplishment took some swipes at former President Donald Trump. Sen. Raphael Warnock and Stacey Abrams also addressed supporters in a campaign event where drinking hemlock would have been preferable; some of the most disreputable people were at this rally.\n\nThere were laughable moments like Harris trying to compare her record to that of a sitting president. the claim that the Biden-Harris administration, or co-presidency, was tough on the border is facially untrue. They're balloon-testing a series of lies, and they shouldn't resonate. But it will all depend on how the GOP responds. Yet, all of this is overshadowed by Harris' deployment of a weird accent (via The Guardian):\n\nHarris spoke of walking underground tunnels at the California border and prosecuting traffickers, and pledged to bring back the border security bill that was tanked in Congress by Republicans to preserve the issue in the campaign.\n\nReferencing a Migos song - popular as an Atlanta group - she said: \"He does not walk it as he talks it.\"\n\nAhead of Harris's appearance on Tuesday, several Atlanta voices made the case for her. Mayor Andre Dickens noted that this was the vice-president's 15th time visiting the state since 2021. Harris has been in Atlanta so often that she may as well have rented a condo in Buckhead to save money.\n\nHarris is expected back in the state next week, and will debut her running mate on a seven-stop swing state tour, according to details confirmed by her campaign. Politico reported Harris will hold the first rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Harris said she as of today has not yet picked the candidate yet.\n\nIn her speech, Harris sought not only to attack her opponent but to refocus on top voter issues in Georgia, such as the economy.\n\n\"Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,\" she said. \"When our middle class is strong, America is strong. To keep our middle class strong, families need relief from the high cost of living so that they have a chance not to get by but to get ahead.\"\n\nShe said she would go after price gouging and hidden fees by banks and other companies, and take on corporate landlords to cap unfair rent increases, and to cap prescription drug costs.\n\n\"There are signs Donald Trump is feeling\" the competition, she says.\n\n\"You may have noticed he pulled out of the debate.\"\n\nShe repeated the assertion made by her campaign in recent days that Trump is \"just plain weird\".\n\n\"I do hope Trump will agree to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes -

Despite Republican counterarguments highlighting concerns over the Biden administration's policies, the Harris campaign maintains that a mix of high turnout and suburban support can secure a Democratic win in the state.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/23_07_2024_11_40_16_9544228.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774352", "eventUri": "eng-9774352", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Stiviano, Shelly Sterling and Re-Creating the Iconic Barbara Walters Interviews\n\nDressed in \"hot girl\" attire while bouncing and twerking to her hits, Megan Thee Stallion stumped for Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign during a boisterous rally that featured fellow rapper Quavo as well as Stacey Abrams on Tuesday in Atlanta.\n\n\"We're about to make history!\" shouted Megan Thee Stallion while rapping her Grammy-winning hit \"Savage,\" wearing a Democrat blue suit and a tie with a cropped white shirt revealing her midriff. Visible from the stage was also a sign that read \"Hotties For Harris.\"\n\nDuring the brief but energetic set, the Texas native and her dancers, who mirrored her dress with blue blazers, shorts and full white shirts but no ties, bounced through a handful of hits that also included \"Girls in the Hood.\" Seconds into \"Savage\", her last song, the VP's fellow HBCU alum of Houston's Texas Southern University instructed the audience to \"make some noise for Ms. Harris, our future president.\"\n\nHer performance came in the final stretch of a taut rally with a playlist very reflective of the city in which it was held, including \"Welcome to Atlanta\" from superproducer Jermaine Dupri, who was present to support Harris. At one point, the Dupri-produced \"Never Scared\" was played to emphasize that Harris was not afraid to debate former President Donald Trump. Various Democratic speakers, including former Georgia gubernatorial challenger Stacey Abrams and Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, fired up the crowd.\n\nAs the program's second speaker, Abrams reminded the crowd how Georgia saved the nation from Trump once before. In 2020, Abrams led the successful effort to turn Georgia blue for Biden-Harris while also helping to elect two Democratic U.S. Senators in Ossoff and Warnock to give the Democrats a slim advantage in the Senate. She also vowed that \"we will not go back\" to applause also peppered with chants to \"lock him up\" after describing the horrors Trump's presidency entailed.\n\n\"We will do the work of making Kamala Harris not only someone who breaks ties in the Senate but breaks barriers in the Oval Office,\" she ended to thunderous applause.\n\nNot long after Megan left the stage, Migos rapper Quavo unexpectedly stepped out to speak in support of Harris, with whom he's worked to resolve \"the gun violence issue.\" The issue hits very close to home for the Atlanta-area rapper who lost his fellow Migos member Takeoff, also his nephew, to gun violence in Houston almost two years ago. Speaking to his peers, the rapper said, \"The one thing I learned about working with Vice President Harris is she always stands on business.\"\n\nUrging those who may have never voted to vote in this election, he promised them that \"we're changing the culture again\" in reference to the Migos' genre-changing, star-making 2017 album Culture. Donald Glover famously referenced one of its hit songs \"Bad and Boujee\" during his Golden Globes acceptance speech when his hit FX series Atlanta won best comedy, bringing the group mainstream attention.\n\nAddressing the contentious border issue, a key Republican talking point for Trump, Harris evoked the rapper in summing up Trump's questionable stance. \"As my friend Quavo would say, he doesn't walk it like he talks it,\" she said, in reference to Migos' Top 10 2018 hit \"Walk It Talk It\" with Drake from their Culture II album, as the crowd applauded.\n\nBefore closing out her speech on a high note that urged attendees to roll up their sleeves and work hard to secure victory on Nov. 5, a mere 98 days away, Harris noted her opponent's unwillingness to debate her in September about his platform, which she stated includes an assault against women's reproductive health and additional threats outlined in Project 2025.\n\n\"He won't debate me, but he and his running mate sure have a lot to say about me,\" she said. \"As the saying goes, 'If you got something to say, say it to my face.'\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Harris has been in Atlanta so often that she may as well have rented a condo in Buckhead to save money.\n\nFor the last two years, Harris has been Joe Biden's chief campaign surrogate in Georgia, making deliberate connections with campaign organizers and Black community leaders, a weapon in the Democratic arsenal that Republicans have not been able to match.\n\n\"Georgia is on everybody's mind,\" said Raphael Warnock, the senator and reverend, to a boisterous crowd. \"And there's a reason. Because of what you did in 2020, 2021, everybody knows that the road to the White House goes through Georgia.\"\n\nDonald Trump has been on his heels in recent polls, which show ground captured in the rust belt. The former president announced that he would refrain from committing to a debate against Harris until after the Democratic national convention, which the senator Jon Ossoff characterized as cowardice.\n\n\"I know about having an opponent who's too scared to debate,\" Ossoff said, harkening back to his winning 2020 campaign against then senator David Perdue, in which he spent 90 minutes debating an empty chair. \"The candidate who is dodging debates is the candidate who is losing.\"\n\nNow that Harris has replaced Biden as the presumptive nominee, the question is whether there is time to capitalize on those connections in a state that may still be difficult to win for Democrats.\n\nStacey Abrams took the stage at 5.33pm to thunderous chants of \"Stacey!\", which Abrams immediately turned around into a chant for \"Kamala!\"\n\n\"We are the ones who put our boots on the ground,\" said the former gubernatorial candidate and voting rights advocate. She preached the virtues of a progressive presidency on infrastructure development in the Black community, on job creation and on the climate. She pointedly noted that Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, who defeated her two years ago, took credit for new investment in solar panel manufacturing in Georgia even as the federal government has been spurring those investments.\n\n\"They started with Kamala Harris and Joe Biden believing in the environment,\" she said.\n\nA crowd of 10,000 or more filled the Georgia State Convocation Center, with people waiting outside for a seat. Previous appearances in Georgia by Biden and Harris have been closely vetted campaign events filled with a curated selection of activists, advocates and party leaders. Though the guest speakers on Tuesday were a selection of federal officials and local leaders - with Geoff Duncan, the former Republican lieutenant governor, stalking the edges of the press pit - that selectivity was less evident.\n\n\"Georgia saved the whole nation,\" Warnock said. \"I have a feeling that Georgia is going to save the nation one more time.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk",

There's a new energy that we didn't have previously,\" said Dean, who owns a coffee shop in northwest Detroit. \"Folks that were not interested in a Biden-Trump race are definitely interested now that we have the vice president on the top of the ticket.\"\n\nA week after Harris secured enough delegate support to effectively lock down the Democratic nomination, the whirlwind of excitement coursing through the party is giving way to the urgent work of building a Harris coalition - after spending a year trying to shore up Biden's fraying one.\n\n\"It's not just we have an opportunity to make history,\" said Dean, who also leads the Michigan Black Business Alliance. \"It's also, 'Oh my gosh, what happens if we don't?'\"\n\nMichigan will be a critical laboratory for how the Harris campaign builds and sustains its coalition and the degree to which it will look different from Biden's winning 2020 alliance that he struggled to keep together this year, particularly with younger voters and voters of color.\n\nConversations with more than two dozen voters, party activists and Democratic officials in Detroit and the surrounding communities underscored a surge in interest toward Harris among women, voters of color and younger voters. It's an open question how her support holds among independent voters and rank-and-file labor union members, particularly as Trump and Republican groups race to define her.\n\n\"Instead of having something to vote against, now we have something to vote for,\" said Rev. Charles Williams, pastor of Historic King Solomon Baptist Church, who sounded the alarm months ago about a lack of enthusiasm among many voters for Biden, despite the achievements of his first term.\n\n\"Pre-Joe Biden's announcement, we were stirring molasses,\" Williams said in an interview outside his church this week. \"Post-Joe Biden's announcement, we're on a rocket ship.\"\n\nBattle for the 'blue wall'\n\nJust 10 days into her presidential candidacy, Harris' campaign is still ramping up - conducting a vice presidential vetting process on a short deadline, rewriting plans for next month's Democratic National Convention in Chicago and beefing up advertising and fundraising teams after she raised $200 million in her first week.\n\nTrump's campaign, meanwhile, began unleashing a fresh wave of attacks on Harris on Tuesday with a $12.2 million television advertising buy across six battleground states, including Michigan. One new ad labels Harris the Biden administration's \"border czar\" and highlights her role in serving as the administration's point person in terms of addressing the root causes of migration from Central America.\n\n\"This is America's border czar - and she's failed us,\" a narrator says over video of Harris dancing at an event. The narrator describes the vice president as \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously Liberal.\"\n\nTrump won Michigan, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in 2016 - cracking the Democratic \"blue wall\" of must-win-states. Biden won those states back four years later. And before his exit from the race, his campaign had identified the three states as his most realistic path to securing the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win this fall.\n\nThough Harris' appeal among women, voters of color and young people could expand the map and put in play Sun Belt battlegrounds - including, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, where Harris held a rally Tuesday night - the blue wall states are certain to be a focus for both Harris and Trump.\n\nThat's not lost on ardent supporters of the vice president like Dean, who named her coffee shop Rosa after her great-grandmother, someone who she said would be thrilled by the historic nature of Harris' candidacy.\n\n\"We have a fear in our country because we've seen racism and we've seen sexism,\" Dean said. \"I've heard a lot of comments about, well, will they vote for her? I said there is no 'they,' it is us. And with that confidence and with that momentum, it becomes contagious.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump walks offstage after speaking at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on July 20, 2024.\n\nAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images/File\n\n'A renewed spark' in Dearborn\n\nThough Harris' candidacy is in its early stages, and Trump's attacks are only beginning, some Michigan Democrats say the vice president has the opportunity to shed the skepticism many felt toward Biden.\n\nIn Michigan's Democratic presidential primary in February, more than 101,000 people - 13.2% of the primary electorate - cast their votes for \"uncommitted,\" rather than Biden, in what was largely seen as a show of opposition to the president's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Uncommitted\" won 57% of the vote in Dearborn, home to large Arab American and Muslim communities, to Biden's 40% - an outcome that served as a glaring warning sign in a Democratic stronghold in the must-win swing state.\n\nThough Harris will have to tread carefully over the war in Gaza to avoid undermining Biden - and her statements, choice of running mate and more will play roles in how she is judged - she could win back some voters in communities that have largely broken with Biden.\n\nDearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who supported the campaign to lodge \"uncommitted\" protest votes during the primary, said he sees a potential opening for Harris.\n\n\"Wth Vice President Harris, you see a renewed spark,\" Hammoud told CNN, \"especially amongst a younger population, a more diverse coalition and an opportunity to rebuild that coalition that helped put President Biden over the top.\"\n\nAsked whether he would support Harris and encourage others in his community to do the same, Hammoud said it was too early to say. He said he wanted to hear more from Harris - amplifying on her empathetic comments about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week - and wouldn't likely reach a decision without a conversation with her or her foreign policy advisers.\n\n\"It really falls down to the values and priorities. That has not changed for me,\" he said. \"I'm hopeful that Vice President Harris will chart a new course.\"\n\n'Quite the roller coaster'\n\nHere in Michigan, the contours of the new race are settling in, which Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens heard first-hand as she knocked on doors in her Oakland County district north of Detroit.\n\nA blue and white sign in bold letters, \"Dump Trump,\" was planted in a front yard only a few houses down from one that read, \"Michigan for Trump. Make America Great Again.\"\n\n\"I do think you're seeing people activated in a new way,\" Stevens said.\n\nWhile many residents weren't home - or didn't answer their doors - Stevens forged ahead until she found two cars in the driveway and the lights on inside a white, two-story house.\n\n\"How are you feeling about the switch from Biden to Harris?\" Stevens asked.\n\n\"I feel good,\" replied Reuben Maxbauer, who held his young son in his arms as he answered the door. \"If the last seven days are representative of the next 100 days, it will be quite the roller coaster, but very exciting.\"\n\nBut Maxbauer, who has family members living in Israel, said he wanted to learn more about Harris' positions, especially on the Middle East.\n\n\"I don't think she has a clearly enough defined position, at least that we're aware of,\" he said, \"that I can say whether she makes us comfortable or not.\"\n\nAs she continued her walk, Stevens acknowledged that is one of the lingering challenges for Harris and Democrats in Michigan - a critical balancing act of foreign policy and domestic politics.\n\n\"Where we're standing, every vote really matters Every conversation carries a lot of weight,\" Stevens said. \"But I'm not going to sugarcoat. There's also still a lot of passions and tensions and emotions around the Middle East.\"\n\nBut in the closing three months of the race, Stevens said, Trump may end up a unifying force - for Democrats too.\n\n\"I think that's what we'll see happen,\" she said. \"I really do.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_bradner@cnn.com", "name":

Details are scarce, but Rolling Stone reports the appearance will include a \"special performance.\" The event is set to take place at 7:30 p.m.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion is not overtly political. In the past, she's encouraged fans to participate in elections and at one point called Michelle Obama \"Thee\" First Lady.

Harris has been in Atlanta so often that she may as well have rented a condo in Buckhead to save money.\n\nFor the last two years, Harris has been Joe Biden's chief campaign surrogate in Georgia, making deliberate connections with campaign organizers and Black community leaders, a weapon in the Democratic arsenal that Republicans have not been able to match.\n\n\"Georgia is on everybody's mind,\" said Raphael Warnock, the senator and reverend, to a boisterous crowd. \"And there's a reason. Because of what you did in 2020, 2021, everybody knows that the road to the White House goes through Georgia.\"\n\nDonald Trump has been on his heels in recent polls, which show ground captured in the rust belt. The former president announced that he would refrain from committing to a debate against Harris until after the Democratic national convention, which the senator Jon Ossoff characterized as cowardice.\n\n\"I know about having an opponent who's too scared to debate,\" Ossoff said, harkening back to his winning 2020 campaign against then senator David Perdue, in which he spent 90 minutes debating an empty chair. \"The candidate who is dodging debates is the candidate who is losing.\"\n\nNow that Harris has replaced Biden as the presumptive nominee, the question is whether there is time to capitalize on those connections in a state that may still be difficult to win for Democrats.\n\nStacey Abrams took the stage at 5.33pm to thunderous chants of \"Stacey!\", which Abrams immediately turned around into a chant for \"Kamala!\"\n\n\"We are the ones who put our boots on the ground,\" said the former gubernatorial candidate and voting rights advocate. She preached the virtues of a progressive presidency on infrastructure development in the Black community, on job creation and on the climate. She pointedly noted that Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, who defeated her two years ago, took credit for new investment in solar panel manufacturing in Georgia even as the federal government has been spurring those investments.\n\n\"They started with Kamala Harris and Joe Biden believing in the environment,\" she said.\n\nA crowd of 10,000 or more filled the Georgia State Convocation Center, with people waiting outside for a seat. Previous appearances in Georgia by Biden and Harris have been closely vetted campaign events filled with a curated selection of activists, advocates and party leaders. Though the guest speakers on Tuesday were a selection of federal officials and local leaders - with Geoff Duncan, the former Republican lieutenant governor, stalking the edges of the press pit - that selectivity was less evident.\n\n\"Georgia saved the whole nation,\" Warnock said. \"I have a feeling that Georgia is going to save the nation one more time.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com",

How Long Can Democrats Ride It?", "body": "Their crowds are dancing. Beyonc\u00e9 has conquered the soundtrack. The celebrities -- from Southern rappers to Hollywood actors -- are showing up.\n\nAnd by the time Vice President Kamala Harris took the stage on Tuesday night in Atlanta for what her aides billed as the kickoff for her new-and-improved campaign, it was clear that President Biden had been left a distant memory -- a name not even mentioned in her remarks.\n\n\"The momentum in this race is shifting,\" she declared from behind a lectern embossed with the vice-presidential seal. \"There are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it.\"\n\nMs. Harris's ascent to the top of the ticket has transformed the presidential race into a fundamentally different contest, delivering an electric shock to a listless Democratic Party that for more than a year struggled to mobilize its base behind Mr. Biden.\n\nBut the real test awaits: whether Ms. Harris can convert the wave of pent-up liberal energy into sustained momentum. While polling shows that the party's core voters have rallied behind Ms. Harris, the race remains in a dead heat, reflecting the politics of a fiercely divided nation. After months of Democratic attrition over a weakened candidate, Ms. Harris must now rebuild the coalition that powered Democrats -- and the Biden-Harris ticket -- to victory in 2020.\n\nIn some ways, her campaign remains a work in progress. Though Ms. Harris inherited the 1,300 people working for Mr. Biden's re-election operation and its $96 million in the bank, her plans to reshape it remain unsettled. She has yet to fully reveal her own vision for the party and the country, beyond what she inherited, or to hold a news media interview.\n\nAnd she still needs to pick a running mate, though an announcement is expected early next week. Cautioning that no vice-presidential decisions have been made, her campaign announced Tuesday night that the new ticket would begin a swing through the seven battleground states next week -- starting in Philadelphia.\n\nShe will be operating in one of the most unpredictable political environments in recent memory. Not since the era of black-and-white television have two candidates competed in a race measured in weeks, rather than the nearly yearlong traditional battle to the White House.\n\nThe condensed timeline could extend her support enough to last through the election -- or send it crashing down.\n\n\"How long does the honeymoon last? Who knows,\" said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster. \"When you have an unprecedented event like this, people take time to digest it.\"\n\nSo far, Democrats are thrilled with what they see. With thousands of people, her rally in Atlanta was far larger than any event hosted by the Biden campaign. But it was also a hard tonal shift away from the president.\n\nThe Biden campaign, as in 2020, had been about restoring the \"soul of the nation,\" a paean to a lost pre-Trump comity he hoped to bring back. Ms. Harris is pushing a message squarely about what's next.\n\n\"This campaign is about two very different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past,\" she said on Tuesday. \"We are not going back because ours is a fight for the future and for freedom.\"\n\nLike the president, Ms. Harris promised to lower housing costs and tackle prescription drug prices. She vowed to protect \"hard-fought freedoms\" including voting rights, pledged to expand access to abortion and, as she did last week in Wisconsin, told supporters, \"The baton is on our hands.\"\n\nBut the frame was new, to reflect the upended reality of the campaign. The Harris warm-up speakers mocked the Trump campaign for running the same playbook against her that it did against Mr. Biden.\n\n\"Some days I feel sorry for Republicans, because they've got to figure out how to run a criminal against a prosecutor,\" said Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia.\n\nIn the most emotionally charged moment of the Atlanta rally, Ms. Harris ridiculed Mr. Trump for announcing last week that he was backing off his commitment to a September debate he had agreed to attend when Mr. Biden was still running.\n\n\"Well Donald, I do hope you'll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage,\" she said, drawing out the tension with a long pause. \"Because as the saying goes, if you've got something to say, say it to my face.\"\n\nThe crowd went wild. And in the campaign's YouTube post-rally show -- another thing that did not exist when Mr. Biden was running -- the actor Sterling K. Brown recalled the triumphant \"say it to my face\" moment and declared, \"I felt that in my bones.\"\n\nCampaign aides say they now face the challenge of converting the burst of enthusiasm into more durable support.\n\nThere are early signs that Democratic voters may be giving her a second look, after they largely rejected her during her ill-fated 2020 primary campaign. In a little more than a week, she has broken fund-raising records, dominated social media and created the kind of energy that some Democrats say they haven't seen since Barack Obama first ran for the White House nearly two decades ago. A series of recent polls show a significant increase in the number of voters who view her more favorably than even just a month ago.\n\nHarris aides say this new sense of energy has already opened up fresh opportunities for their campaign. By the time Mr. Biden exited the race, Democrats had quietly acknowledged that his path to victory had narrowed to the \"blue wall\" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nMs. Harris's campaign now says the plan is to compete across a wider range of more racially diverse Sun Belt and Southern states, including Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.\n\n\"We have multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes,\" said Dan Kanninen, the campaign's battleground states director, drawing an unstated contrast with Mr. Biden. \"The vice president is strong in both the blue wall and the Sun Belt, and we are running hard in both.\"\n\nDemocrats also hope to benefit from the shortened timeline. The longer the Harris campaign can portray her as a cultural phenomenon, the longer she can avoid articulating details of her policy agenda that could divide her support.\n\n\"I think we are three weeks from knowing whether she can ascend the Obama ladder to where it's about her and not any specific policies she has,\" said Rick Davis, who was the campaign manager for Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential bid, which was derailed by Mr. Obama's political rise.\n\nFor now, the Harris team intends to skip some of the traditional markers of a presidential bid. While Ms. Harris released a host of policy papers during her 2020 campaign -- some of which she has since disavowed -- this time she plans to cast herself as a policy extension of Mr. Biden's administration. She may release some economic plans that largely mirror what the president has proposed, but is unlikely to offer any policy surprises.\n\nRepublicans have struggled to adapt to the changed environment, cycling through a series of attacks against Ms. Harris over the past week before settling on the playbook that they have been pursuing against Mr. Biden for more than a year.\n\n\"When Kamala tells us she is weak, failed and dangerously liberal, we should believe her,\" the Trump campaign said in a statement about Ms. Harris on Tuesday.\n\nThat language almost exactly echoed the attacks used against Mr. Biden throughout the campaign: \"Joe Biden is weak, failed, dishonest and not fit for the White House,\" Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, Mr. Trump's top campaign aides, said in a July 3 statement.\n\nTrump campaign officials attribute the shift in the race to what Tony Fabrizio, a campaign pollster, has called the \"Harris honeymoon.\" They plan to focus on the same set of issues that have driven Mr. Trump's campaign for months: economic discontent, concerns about the border, high housing costs and worries about crime.\n\nMr. Trump's aides believe those issues may override concerns among moderate Republican voters about the former president's polarizing style and criminal record.\n\nStill, Democrats say they see little signs of fading support. A series of calls hosted by different demographic groups -- white men, white women, Black women, Latinos -- have attracted hundreds of thousands of participants and raised millions of dollars.\n\nKatie Paris, the founder of a political organization for suburban moms, said her group had heated debates after the debate a month ago over whether Mr. Biden should step down.\n\nBut after he endorsed Ms. Harris, those disagreements vanished. Now, she said, her members are more unified and mobilized than she has seen since 2020. And thousands more people have signed up to organize with them.\n\n\"Politics can feel like such a slog. Nobody likes two-year presidential campaigns,\" Ms. Paris said. \"Give me 100 days, and, 'OK! I can grab my friends and do that.'\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_hip_hop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern hip hop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_wall_(U.S._politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blue wall (U.S. politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Warnock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raphael Warnock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Newhouse", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neil Newhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_K._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sterling K.

Megan Thee Stallion signed on to perform at an Atlanta rally on Harris' presidential run on Tuesday, July 30. The \"Savage\" rapper, 29, revealed that she'll be taking part in the event on Instagram on Monday, July 29.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden announced that he was bowing out of the 2024 election, Harris has been hitting the campaign trail hard, and she's expected to win the nomination at the DNC, after the president endorsed her. She's set to appear at the George State Convocation Center. Megan posted a photo of herself with \"Kamala\" and \"ATL\" printed on it, teasing the event for 7:30. \"ATL HOTTIES SEE YOU TOMORROW,\" she wrote with an American flag and blue heart emoji.\n\nHarris has received so much support from the music world since announcing her candidacy. One of the first major musicians to endorse her was Charli XCX, who released one of the year's most critically-acclaimed albums brat. With the term \"Brat Summer\" taking off thanks to Charli's record, the \"Apple\" singer tweeted her support for the vice president. \"Kamala IS brat,\" she wrote.\n\nBeyonce has also apparently shown support for Harris' presidential run for the Oval Office. In the first campaign ad, Queen B's song \"Freedom\" was featured. The Cowboy Carter singer is very meticulous about where her music can be used, and allowing it to be used in Harris' video is seemingly a cosign. Cardi B also seemingly showed support, taking to X (formerly Twitter) after the VP announced that she'd be running. \"LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate,\" she wrote.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_crowley@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "James Crowley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Girl_Summer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hot Girl Summer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardi_B", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardi B"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charli XCX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1681176643_aac4de-e1722355404208.jpg?quality=100&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774352", "eventUri": "eng-9774352", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 221, "textEnd": 228}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 328, "textEnd": 335}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

It's 90 degrees, and puddles still linger in the street from a summer shower only hours before. Vice President Kamala Harris is not scheduled to touch down in Atlanta for another hour, but already crowds are gathering, eager to catch a glimpse of the historic Democratic nominee-to-be.\n\nDespite the weather, voters young and old are crowding the pavement, the line stretching back so far it crosses over a nearby highway. The palpable sense of apathy that had dominated conversations around 2024 presidential election has vanished, replaced with excitement.\n\nChitra Subbarayan, an Atlanta resident, arrived at the Convocation Center at 3:15 p.m. to attend the rally.\n\n\"I wanted to see her because I think she's going to make a difference,\" she said. \"We need to hold onto our democracy, it's very important.\"\n\nIn her view, she said, elections should be about the will of the people, rather than any one candidate. As the mother of a daughter, she said protecting women's reproductive freedom is a top priority for her during this election cycle.\n\n\"A woman's right to control her own body is so important,\" she said. \"It's more important than anything else.\"\n\nShe also sees Harris' youth and stamina as an asset on the campaign trail, adding that she was relieved when Biden announced that he was dropping out of the race.\n\n\"She has the energy and she has the background,\" Subbarayan said. \"There's going to be a lot of mud-slinging, and she's used to it. She's not going to let it bother her.\"\n\nMore: Trump and Vance holding Atlanta rally on Saturday, days after VP Harris appeared in Georgia\n\nHer sentiments were echoed by other voters who attended the rally.\n\n\"This was the shock of energy that the Democrats needed,\" said Atlanta-based makeup artist Jennifer Bennett, who got tickets to attend the rally through her union, the Georgia AFL-CIO. Her biggest priorities, she said, were issues that affect workers and families, as well as access to healthcare and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nShe thinks Harris has a much better chance of winning in a state like Georgia than President Joe Biden would have, had he stayed in the race, because of the excitement surrounding her candidacy.\n\n\"Our biggest obstacle isn't Trump,\" she said. \"Our biggest obstacle is the couch. It's the people who stay home on election day.\"\n\nMore: 'Not going back': Kamala Harris voters at Georgia rally say abortion is top issue\n\nFor Jewel Anderson, owner of the food truck Amorous Tacos, Harris' candidacy is a sign that the political landscape is ready to embrace change. When she first heard the news that Biden was dropping out of the race, her first thought was, \"It's time to work!\"\n\n\"It was such an energy booster,\" she said, adding that it was exciting for her to see a Black, female candidate running for office. \"It felt like Obama '08 energy, with everybody coming together.\"\n\nBoth Bennett and Anderson also believe Harris is a stronger candidate to face off in a debate against former President Donald Trump or his Vice Presidential nominee J.D.

She spent considerable time on the Joe Biden campaign trail advocating for abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022.\n\nIn March, Harris made history by visiting a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota - marking the first time a sitting US president or vice president is believed to have visited an abortion provider.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion also called Harris \"our future president\" and told the crowd they were \"about to make history with the first female president - the first Black female president.\"\n\n\"Let's get this done, honey,\" she added.\n\nAtlanta rapper Quavo, who was also present, praised Harris for her work on addressing gun violence, calling the vice president someone who \"always stands on business\". The artist set up the Rocket Foundation in 2022 after his nephew and Takeoff was shot and killed aged 28.\n\nQuavo and Megan Thee Stallion are the latest of many figures from the music world who have shown their support for Harris, including Ariana Grande, Lizzo, Olivia Rodrigo, Beyonce and British singer Charli XCX.\n\nAfter Biden withdrew from the race and Harris was announced as the new Democrat frontrunner, Charli XCX referenced her latest hit album as she declared on social media: \"Kamala IS brat.\"\n\nThe concept of \"Brat\", the title of the Charli XCX's latest album, has been described by the singer as someone who has a \"pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra\". It is seen as a rejection of the \"clean girl\" aesthetic - swapping a groomed look for something more scrappy and care-free.\n\nHarris's campaign HQ immediately welcomed the support and jumped on the bandwagon, changing its background image to the neon green and font used for the \"Girl, So Confusing\" singer's album artwork.\n\nMany fans have also been making videos that combine clips of Harris speaking with songs from the album.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Thee_Stallion", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Megan Thee Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charli_XCX", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charli XCX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

There's a new energy that we didn't have previously,\" said Dean, who owns a coffee shop in northwest Detroit. \"Folks that were not interested in a Biden-Trump race are definitely interested now that we have the vice president on the top of the ticket.\"\n\nA week after Harris secured enough delegate support to effectively lock down the Democratic nomination, the whirlwind of excitement coursing through the party is giving way to the urgent work of building a Harris coalition - after spending a year trying to shore up Biden's fraying one.\n\n\"It's not just we have an opportunity to make history,\" said Dean, who also leads the Michigan Black Business Alliance. \"It's also, 'Oh my gosh, what happens if we don't?'\"\n\nMichigan will be a critical laboratory for how the Harris campaign builds and sustains its coalition and the degree to which it will look different from Biden's winning 2020 alliance that he struggled to keep together this year, particularly with younger voters and voters of color.\n\nConversations with more than two dozen voters, party activists and Democratic officials in Detroit and the surrounding communities underscored a surge in interest toward Harris among women, voters of color and younger voters. It's an open question how her support holds among independent voters and rank-and-file labor union members, particularly as Trump and Republican groups race to define her.\n\n\"Instead of having something to vote against, now we have something to vote for,\" said Rev. Charles Williams, pastor of Historic King Solomon Baptist Church, who sounded the alarm months ago about a lack of enthusiasm among many voters for Biden, despite the achievements of his first term.\n\n\"Pre-Joe Biden's announcement, we were stirring molasses,\" Williams said in an interview outside his church this week. \"Post-Joe Biden's announcement, we're on a rocket ship.\"\n\nBattle for the 'blue wall'\n\nJust 10 days into her presidential candidacy, Harris' campaign is still ramping up - conducting a vice presidential vetting process on a short deadline, rewriting plans for next month's Democratic National Convention in Chicago and beefing up advertising and fundraising teams after she raised $200 million in her first week.\n\nTrump's campaign, meanwhile, began unleashing a fresh wave of attacks on Harris on Tuesday with a $12.2 million television advertising buy across six battleground states, including Michigan. One new ad labels Harris the Biden administration's \"border czar\" and highlights her role in serving as the administration's point person in terms of addressing the root causes of migration from Central America.\n\n\"This is America's border czar - and she's failed us,\" a narrator says over video of Harris dancing at an event. The narrator describes the vice president as \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously Liberal.\"\n\nTrump won Michigan, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in 2016 - cracking the Democratic \"blue wall\" of must-win-states. Biden won those states back four years later. And before his exit from the race, his campaign had identified the three states as his most realistic path to securing the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win this fall.\n\nThough Harris' appeal among women, voters of color and young people could expand the map and put in play Sun Belt battlegrounds - including, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, where Harris held a rally Tuesday night - the blue wall states are certain to be a focus for both Harris and Trump.\n\nThat's not lost on ardent supporters of the vice president like Dean, who named her coffee shop Rosa after her great-grandmother, someone who she said would be thrilled by the historic nature of Harris' candidacy.\n\n\"We have a fear in our country because we've seen racism and we've seen sexism,\" Dean said. \"I've heard a lot of comments about, well, will they vote for her? I said there is no 'they,' it is us. And with that confidence and with that momentum, it becomes contagious.\"\n\n'A renewed spark' in Dearborn\n\nThough Harris' candidacy is in its early stages, and Trump's attacks are only beginning, some Michigan Democrats say the vice president has the opportunity to shed the skepticism many felt toward Biden.\n\nIn Michigan's Democratic presidential primary in February, more than 101,000 people - 13.2% of the primary electorate - cast their votes for \"uncommitted,\" rather than Biden, in what was largely seen as a show of opposition to the president's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Uncommitted\" won 57% of the vote in Dearborn, home to large Arab American and Muslim communities, to Biden's 40% - an outcome that served as a glaring warning sign in a Democratic stronghold in the must-win swing state.\n\nThough Harris will have to tread carefully over the war in Gaza to avoid undermining Biden - and her statements, choice of running mate and more will play roles in how she is judged - she could win back some voters in communities that have largely broken with Biden.\n\nDearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who supported the campaign to lodge \"uncommitted\" protest votes during the primary, said he sees a potential opening for Harris.\n\n\"Wth Vice President Harris, you see a renewed spark,\" Hammoud told CNN, \"especially amongst a younger population, a more diverse coalition and an opportunity to rebuild that coalition that helped put President Biden over the top.\"\n\nAsked whether he would support Harris and encourage others in his community to do the same, Hammoud said it was too early to say. He said he wanted to hear more from Harris - amplifying on her empathetic comments about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week - and wouldn't likely reach a decision without a conversation with her or her foreign policy advisers.\n\n\"It really falls down to the values and priorities. That has not changed for me,\" he said. \"I'm hopeful that Vice President Harris will chart a new course.\"\n\n'Quite the roller coaster'\n\nHere in Michigan, the contours of the new race are settling in, which Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens heard first-hand as she knocked on doors in her Oakland County district north of Detroit.\n\nA blue and white sign in bold letters, \"Dump Trump,\" was planted in a front yard only a few houses down from one that read, \"Michigan for Trump. Make America Great Again.\"\n\n\"I do think you're seeing people activated in a new way,\" Stevens said.\n\nWhile many residents weren't home - or didn't answer their doors - Stevens forged ahead until she found two cars in the driveway and the lights on inside a white, two-story house.\n\n\"How are you feeling about the switch from Biden to Harris?\" Stevens asked.\n\n\"I feel good,\" replied Reuben Maxbauer, who held his young son in his arms as he answered the door. \"If the last seven days are representative of the next 100 days, it will be quite the roller coaster, but very exciting.\"\n\nBut Maxbauer, who has family members living in Israel, said he wanted to learn more about Harris' positions, especially on the Middle East.\n\n\"I don't think she has a clearly enough defined position, at least that we're aware of,\" he said, \"that I can say whether she makes us comfortable or not.\"\n\nAs she continued her walk, Stevens acknowledged that is one of the lingering challenges for Harris and Democrats in Michigan - a critical balancing act of foreign policy and domestic politics.\n\n\"Where we're standing, every vote really matters Every conversation carries a lot of weight,\" Stevens said. \"But I'm not going to sugarcoat. There's also still a lot of passions and tensions and emotions around the Middle East.\"\n\nBut in the closing three months of the race, Stevens said, Trump may end up a unifying force - for Democrats too.\n\n\"I think that's what we'll see happen,\" she said. \"I really do.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

There's a new energy that we didn't have previously,\" said Dean, who owns a coffee shop in northwest Detroit. \"Folks that were not interested in a Biden-Trump race are definitely interested now that we have the vice president on the top of the ticket.\"\n\nA week after Harris secured enough delegate support to effectively lock down the Democratic nomination, the whirlwind of excitement coursing through the party is giving way to the urgent work of building a Harris coalition - after spending a year trying to shore up Biden's fraying one.\n\n\"It's not just we have an opportunity to make history,\" said Dean, who also leads the Michigan Black Business Alliance. \"It's also, 'Oh my gosh, what happens if we don't?'\"\n\nMichigan will be a critical laboratory for how the Harris campaign builds and sustains its coalition and the degree to which it will look different from Biden's winning 2020 alliance that he struggled to keep together this year, particularly with younger voters and voters of color.\n\nConversations with more than two dozen voters, party activists and Democratic officials in Detroit and the surrounding communities underscored a surge in interest toward Harris among women, voters of color and younger voters. It's an open question how her support holds among independent voters and rank-and-file labor union members, particularly as Trump and Republican groups race to define her.\n\n\"Instead of having something to vote against, now we have something to vote for,\" said Rev. Charles Williams, pastor of Historic King Solomon Baptist Church, who sounded the alarm months ago about a lack of enthusiasm among many voters for Biden, despite the achievements of his first term.\n\n\"Pre-Joe Biden's announcement, we were stirring molasses,\" Williams said in an interview outside his church this week. \"Post-Joe Biden's announcement, we're on a rocket ship.\"\n\nJust 10 days into her presidential candidacy, Harris' campaign is still ramping up - conducting a vice presidential vetting process on a short deadline, rewriting plans for next month's Democratic National Convention in Chicago and beefing up advertising and fundraising teams after she raised $200 million in her first week.\n\nTrump's campaign, meanwhile, began unleashing a fresh wave of attacks on Harris on Tuesday with a $12.2 million television advertising buy across six battleground states, including Michigan. One new ad labels Harris the Biden administration's \"border czar\" and highlights her role in serving as the administration's point person in terms of addressing the root causes of migration from Central America.\n\n\"This is America's border czar - and she's failed us,\" a narrator says over video of Harris dancing at an event. The narrator describes the vice president as \"Failed. Weak. Dangerously Liberal.\"\n\nTrump won Michigan, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in 2016 - cracking the Democratic \"blue wall\" of must-win-states. Biden won those states back four years later. And before his exit from the race, his campaign had identified the three states as his most realistic path to securing the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win this fall.\n\nThough Harris' appeal among women, voters of color and young people could expand the map and put in play Sun Belt battlegrounds - including, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, where Harris held a rally Tuesday night - the blue wall states are certain to be a focus for both Harris and Trump.\n\nThat's not lost on ardent supporters of the vice president like Dean, who named her coffee shop Rosa after her great-grandmother, someone who she said would be thrilled by the historic nature of Harris' candidacy.\n\n\"We have a fear in our country because we've seen racism and we've seen sexism,\" Dean said. \"I've heard a lot of comments about, well, will they vote for her? I said there is no 'they,' it is us. And with that confidence and with that momentum, it becomes contagious.\"\n\nThough Harris' candidacy is in its early stages, and Trump's attacks are only beginning, some Michigan Democrats say the vice president has the opportunity to shed the skepticism many felt toward Biden.\n\nIn Michigan's Democratic presidential primary in February, more than 101,000 people - 13.2% of the primary electorate - cast their votes for \"uncommitted,\" rather than Biden, in what was largely seen as a show of opposition to the president's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Uncommitted\" won 57% of the vote in Dearborn, home to large Arab American and Muslim communities, to Biden's 40% - an outcome that served as a glaring warning sign in a Democratic stronghold in the must-win swing state.\n\nThough Harris will have to tread carefully over the war in Gaza to avoid undermining Biden - and her statements, choice of running mate and more will play roles in how she is judged - she could win back some voters in communities that have largely broken with Biden.\n\nDearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who supported the campaign to lodge \"uncommitted\" protest votes during the primary, said he sees a potential opening for Harris.\n\n\"Wth Vice President Harris, you see a renewed spark,\" Hammoud told CNN, \"especially amongst a younger population, a more diverse coalition and an opportunity to rebuild that coalition that helped put President Biden over the top.\"\n\nAsked whether he would support Harris and encourage others in his community to do the same, Hammoud said it was too early to say. He said he wanted to hear more from Harris - amplifying on her empathetic comments about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza following a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week - and wouldn't likely reach a decision without a conversation with her or her foreign policy advisers.\n\n\"It really falls down to the values and priorities. That has not changed for me,\" he said. \"I'm hopeful that Vice President Harris will chart a new course.\"\n\nHere in Michigan, the contours of the new race are settling in, which Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens heard first-hand as she knocked on doors in her Oakland County district north of Detroit.\n\nA blue and white sign in bold letters, \"Dump Trump,\" was planted in a front yard only a few houses down from one that read, \"Michigan for Trump. Make America Great Again.\"\n\n\"I do think you're seeing people activated in a new way,\" Stevens said.\n\nWhile many residents weren't home - or didn't answer their doors - Stevens forged ahead until she found two cars in the driveway and the lights on inside a white, two-story house.\n\n\"How are you feeling about the switch from Biden to Harris?\" Stevens asked.\n\n\"I feel good,\" replied Reuben Maxbauer, who held his young son in his arms as he answered the door. \"If the last seven days are representative of the next 100 days, it will be quite the roller coaster, but very exciting.\"\n\nBut Maxbauer, who has family members living in Israel, said he wanted to learn more about Harris' positions, especially on the Middle East.\n\n\"I don't think she has a clearly enough defined position, at least that we're aware of,\" he said, \"that I can say whether she makes us comfortable or not.\"\n\nAs she continued her walk, Stevens acknowledged that is one of the lingering challenges for Harris and Democrats in Michigan - a critical balancing act of foreign policy and domestic politics.\n\n\"Where we're standing, every vote really matters Every conversation carries a lot of weight,\" Stevens said. \"But I'm not going to sugarcoat. There's also still a lot of passions and tensions and emotions around the Middle East.\"\n\nBut in the closing three months of the race, Stevens said, Trump may end up a unifying force - for Democrats too.\n\n\"I think that's what we'll see happen,\" she said. \"I really do.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

This event, meant to galvanize support for Harris's potential presidential run, has sparked intense debate and widespread reactions from both fans and political observers alike.\n\nThe rally was intended to energize and mobilize young voters, a demographic crucial to any successful campaign. Harris, who has been vocal about her support for progressive policies and social justice, chose to align herself with Megan Thee Stallion, an artist who has consistently used her platform to advocate for similar issues. However, the nature of Megan's performance has become the focal point of the discussion.\n\nMegan took the stage with her signature energy and charisma, performing a mix of her most popular hits. The crowd was electrified, cheering and dancing along to the music. However, it was her twerking during the performance that has drawn the most attention and criticism. While many in the audience celebrated her unapologetic expression, others questioned the appropriateness of such a display at a political rally.\n\nCritics argue that a presidential rally is not the appropriate venue for twerking, a dance move often associated with sexual expression. They believe that the performance could detract from the seriousness of Harris's campaign and alienate more conservative voters. \"This isn't the time to be twerking,\" said one observer. \"It's okay to sing and entertain, but shaking your booty in front of a big crowd at a political rally is just not appropriate.\"\n\nOn the other hand, supporters of the performance argue that it is essential to engage voters in ways that resonate with them. They believe that Megan's performance brought energy and enthusiasm to the rally, making politics more accessible and relatable to a younger audience. \"Like it or not, you have to meet voters where they are,\" said a fan. \"Every voter isn't the same, and there are a lot of voters who are going to choose apathy over policy. It's a rally. Relax.\"\n\nThe big question on everyone's mind is whether this performance will hurt Kamala Harris's bid for the presidency. While some argue that the association with Megan Thee Stallion could alienate conservative and moderate voters, others believe it could energize the youth vote, which is critical for any successful campaign. Harris's team has yet to comment officially on the performance, but sources close to the campaign suggest they were pleased with the overall turnout and energy.\n\nThe fan reactions have been varied and passionate. Here are some of the responses that have been circulating on social media:\n\nTo understand why Megan Thee Stallion chose to perform in such a manner, it's essential to consider her background and the message she consistently promotes. Megan has always been a staunch advocate for women's empowerment and self-expression. Her music often challenges societal norms and pushes boundaries, encouraging women to take control of their narratives and bodies.\n\nIn many ways, Megan's performance can be seen as an extension of her brand. By twerking at a political rally, she may have been making a statement about the importance of being true to oneself, regardless of the setting. It's a bold move that aligns with her message of authenticity and empowerment, even if it ruffles some feathers.\n\nThis incident highlights a broader cultural clash that is playing out in American society. On one side are those who believe in traditional values and decorum, especially in the political arena. On the other side are those who advocate for progressive values and the importance of authenticity and self-expression, even in political settings.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion's performance at the rally can be seen as a microcosm of this cultural clash. It raises important questions about the role of entertainment in politics and the ways in which politicians can engage with younger, more diverse audiences.\n\nFrom a strategic standpoint, Harris's decision to invite Megan Thee Stallion to perform could be seen as both risky and revolutionary. It's a move that undoubtedly generates buzz and media attention, which is crucial in a crowded political landscape. However, it also carries the risk of alienating certain voter groups who may view the performance as inappropriate.\n\nIn the end, the success of this strategy will depend on how it is received by the broader electorate. If it succeeds in energizing young voters and increasing turnout, it could prove to be a masterstroke. However, if it alienates more voters than it engages, it could backfire.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion's performance at Kamala Harris's rally in Atlanta has sparked a significant amount of debate and discussion. While some view it as an inappropriate display that could hurt Harris's campaign, others see it as a bold and necessary move to engage younger voters.\n\nThis incident serves as a reminder of the complexities and challenges of modern political campaigning. As the lines between entertainment and politics continue to blur, politicians must navigate these waters carefully, balancing the need to engage diverse audiences with the need to maintain decorum and respectability.\n\nAs we look ahead to the upcoming election season, it will be interesting to see how other candidates respond to this incident. Will they follow Harris's lead and incorporate more entertainment into their rallies, or will they stick to more traditional forms of campaigning? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: Megan Thee Stallion's performance has set a new precedent, and its impact will be felt for years to come.\n\nUltimately, the success of any political campaign hinges on the ability to engage and mobilize voters. For Kamala Harris, the youth vote is especially critical. Young voters are more likely to support progressive policies and candidates, and they are often motivated by issues such as social justice, climate change, and student debt.\n\nBy inviting Megan Thee Stallion to perform at her rally, Harris is making a concerted effort to connect with this demographic. It's a move that acknowledges the importance of cultural relevance and the power of music and entertainment in shaping political discourse.\n\nIn the long run, this incident could have far-reaching implications for the future of political campaigning. It challenges traditional notions of what is appropriate in the political arena and opens the door for more diverse and dynamic forms of engagement.\n\nWhether you view it as a bold move or a misstep, there's no denying that Megan Thee Stallion's performance has made a significant impact.

As we're seeing, they last barely two weeks these days. Whatever honeymoon Senator JD Vance and Vice President Kamala Harris had after the national spotlight turned sharply and swiftly on them just a fortnight ago is over.\n\nVoters will want to know what Vance, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, and Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, really believe, and they'll want to know how these two will govern. And by the way, I have to say that Harris is the presumptive presidential nominee because it's not officially signed, sealed and delivered until she formally accepts the nomination at the Democratic National Convention, which begins on August 19th.\n\nSo today and tomorrow, what we're going to do is we're going to examine what JD Vance and Kamala Harris actually believe. Not their biographies, but their values and principles, and crucially how they've acted on those principles in their time in federal office so far.\n\nSo tomorrow it's Vance. Today we're going to talk about Vice President Harris. Now, of course, this is her second try for the presidency. Her first was back in a crowded Democratic field in 2020.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: We need a nominee who has the ability to prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump, and I will do that.\n\nYou ask them, how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours, and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. Yeah, people in America are working, they're working two and three jobs. So when we talk about jobs, let's be really clear. In our America, no one should have to work more than one job.\n\nGrowing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor, who told us her parents couldn't play with us because she, because we were black.\n\nOkay, guys, you know what? America does not want to witness a food fight. They want to know how we're going to put food on their table. (CHEERS)\n\nCHAKRABARTI: That was Kamala Harris in the crowded Democratic presidential debates back in the 2020 race. But I should correct myself because technically speaking back then, Harris wasn't even a 2020 Democratic candidate, because her campaign never gained enough traction, and it ended almost a year before election day.\n\nShe dropped out of the race on December 3rd, 2019, two months before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. However, soon after that, she did, in fact, make history, becoming Joe Biden's VP pick, and then becoming the first female vice president of the United States. But again, honeymoons are short in politics.\n\nAs vice president, when people paid attention to Kamala Harris, it was sometimes because they couldn't quite figure out exactly what she was trying to say.\n\nHARRIS: And then to partner, to ensure that we are speaking the same language, inspired by the opportunity of it all, but then doing the work of updating how we have been talking and thinking about --\n\nPresent culture is the way we express how we're feeling about the moment. And we should always find times to express how we feel about the moment. That is a reflection of joy. Cause it comes in the morning.\n\n(LAUGHS)\n\nAnd I'm talking about the significance of the passage of time, right? The significance of the passage of time.\n\nSo when you think about it, there is great significance to the passage of time in terms of what we need to do to lay these wires, what we need to do to create these jobs. And there is such great significance to the passage of time.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: What wonders hath wrought the passage of time for Kamala Harris?\n\nThe word salad moments are suddenly gone. And in just the past two weeks, the Democratic presidential hopeful seems to have found her voice and her message.\n\n(MONTAGE)\n\nHARRIS: I took on perpetrators of all kinds. (CHEERS) Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. (CHEERS)\n\nSo hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type. (CHEERS)\n\n(APPLAUSE) And Wisconsin, this campaign is also about two different visions for our nation. One where we are focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\nWe believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead. (CHEERS) So Wisconsin, ultimately in this election, we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law? Or a country of chaos, fear and hate?\n\nSo friends, we have 105 days until election day, and in that time, we've got some work to do. But we're not afraid of hard work. We like hard work, don't we? (CHEERS)\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Vice president Kamala Harris kicking off her 2024 presidential campaign in Wisconsin. And of course, now there's even less than 105 days, just 98 and ticking down. Again, the question is, at least for us, in that compressed time, what will she show voters about what she actually believes, and specifically how she would act on those beliefs and translate them into how she'd govern?\n\nToday we're joined by Sharon Austin. She's a political science professor at the University of Florida. Her research focuses on African American women's political behavior. She's also currently writing a book on Black women and the presidency. Professor Austin, welcome to On Point.\n\nSHARON AUSTIN: Thank you very much.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Also joining us today is Jasmine Wright. She's a politics reporter at NOTUS, which is a Washington based publication from the nonpartisan Allbritton Journalism Institute. Previously, Jasmine was a reporter at CNN, where she covered the White House. And she also worked as an embed in the 2020 presidential campaign, covering then Senator Kamala Harris.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So let me ask both of you first, and Jasmine, I'll just kick off with you. The Kamala Harris, the vice president that we've seen in the past two weeks, from your experience with her, how similar or different is she from the Kamala Harris in 2019 and 2020?\n\nWRIGHT: Yeah, I think that she is vastly different both in performance and I think in the small little policies that you're seeing them trickle out as they work to get their broader message. In 2019, she broke into the race as this really inspirational figure. People called her the next Obama, and she and her campaign vocally said that they would like to recreate the Obama coalition to win the Democratic primary.\n\nBut of course, that did not happen. And after she really reached a high point in some ways in the summer of 2019, people were calling her even the front runner above Biden in the race, her campaign torpedoed down for a myriad of reasons, including the inability to fundraise and fighting within the campaign and the inability to really focus on what her message is and be able to convey that to the American people.\n\nAnd I think what you see now is a politician who has spent three years in the White House, really being a partner, a No. 2 to a very professional president. Biden, of course, was in the Senate for 40 years before he even entered into the vice presidency, under then President Barack Obama and to his own presidency.\n\nSo I think you've seen her study and really understand the way that that D.C. works in a way that she didn't understand before, because she had only been in D.C. for two to three years before, or excuse me, two years before running her own campaign and then of course, joining Biden's.\n\nSo I think that's a vastly different person from what I see with my own eyes. Of course, when you talk to her own aides or when I do, they say that they see a different politician, but the question is going to be, how does she keep that momentum going? And I think that's something that they're trying to answer right now behind the scenes.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Absolutely. So Jasmine, I'm going to want to hear a lot more from you over the course of this hour about again, what you've observed and what your sources have told you about, in a sense that I don't want to, I don't mean this in a pejorative, but the understudy role that vice president Harris had being one step away from the Oval Office with Joe Biden, particularly as president.\n\nSo we're going to talk about that in a second, but Professor Austin, I would love to get your view on that same question from the perspective of someone who is outside of political reporting, but looking at politics as a whole, as a professor, do you see a different Kamala Harris now than you saw in 2020?\n\nAUSTIN: I think she stands for the same issues that she stood for when she ran for president before, but I think I agree that she has learned from her mistakes of 2019. Even then, as Jasmine mentioned, she was doing well at first, but the problem was her inability to raise funds. But now just in this past week, she's raised a ton of money from different sectors, different communities.\n\nAnd so I think just with that fact alone, she's showing that she has broad based appeal. And I think she learned from her earlier loss when she was running for president, just the need to really just appeal to everyone, because a lot of people are going to try to paint this as if it's something in which a lot of African Americans are going to vote for her.\n\nAnd that's the group that pretty much is the only group that's going to turn out in large numbers to vote for her. But that is certainly not true, from what I've been seeing. I even have sat in on some of the conference calls, like women for Harris and with Black women for my research to see what they were saying.\n\nAnd in that time, I have seen just people from all backgrounds and ethnicities, and especially the fact that she now can invigorate young people who were pretty much turned off by the Biden administration. So I would say that she's changed in the sense that she's learned from her mistakes, but she's the same in the sense that she is now promoting the same issues that she promoted when she was in the U.S. Senate.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Now, Professor, I may have misheard you, so please correct me. But did you say that, I'm paraphrasing here, that even now there wasn't necessarily a guarantee that Black voters would turn out en masse for Vice President Harris? Or did you say the opposite, actually? Forgive me.\n\nAUSTIN: I said that there was an assumption that African Americans would be the only group that would turn out in large numbers to vote for her. And that's not true, because I'm here in Florida. Just recently, there's an area called the Villages, which is a retirement community for seniors, middle class, upper middle class predominantly white.\n\nAnd they just had a big fundraiser for her there. And they tend to, Florida is a really tricky state. Because like most states, there are blue counties and red counties, and the Villages is thought to be more of a red community, mostly Republican. But even they had a big fundraiser for her. And that shows that her campaign is appealing to seniors.\n\nBut I said earlier that it was assumed that African Americans would be the only group that would turn out in large numbers, but it doesn't look like that's going to be the case. She's appealing to people of different races and ethnicities, younger people, seniors, and et cetera.\n\nPart II\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Professor Austin and Jasmine Wright, let's go through some of the major issues that are front and center in the minds of Americans this election cycle.\n\nSo first and I guess not first and foremost, but one of the bigger ones is of course, immigration. This one is immediately a point in which Republicans are attacking Vice President Harris on, in part because back in March of 2021, President Joe Biden appointed Vice President Harris with a quite important position regarding immigration.\n\nNow specifically, Harris was charged with leading efforts with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador to manage the flow of unaccompanied minors and migrant families arriving from those countries. I will admit across journalism, that was simplified in 2021 as Vice President Harris being the southern border czar.\n\nAnd which is not entirely accurate, that has though haunted her. And for example, here's an interview with New York Times reporter, Astead Herndon, just back in November and Astead talk to Vice President Harris about her work on immigration. And here's her response.\n\nHARRIS: Okay. So let's start with the work that I've done and the work that I've done has been to focus on the root cause issue.\n\nSo not the border issue, but why is it that people are leaving, and to address those issues. And I come at that from the following perspective. Most people don't want to leave home. Most people do not want to leave home. They don't want to leave the place where they were raised. They don't want to leave their grandmother.\n\nThey don't want to leave the church where they grew up in. They don't want to leave their community or their friends. And when they do leave, it usually is one of two things. They are fleeing harm, or they simply cannot satisfy the basic needs of themselves or their family if they stay.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: That's Vice President Harris speaking to Astead Herndon of the New York Times back in November.\n\nJasmine, I think it's clear that that Vice President Harris has a solid sense as to what she believes needs to be done regarding the root causes of migration from especially Central America. But I think most Americans who are thinking about the border issue now are literally thinking about it in terms of what is happening at the U.S.-Mexico border. Do you have some insight on what the vice president actually believes about what needs to be done to reduce or control the flow of undocumented immigrants trying to cross the border?\n\nWRIGHT: I think what you've heard from the vice president's office as she has launched her campaign is that she is going to stay with what the Biden administration has done. Of course, championing that bipartisan legislation that would have impacted the border greatly, that they believe was torpedoed by former President Trump.\n\nThat's going to be a case that she makes over and over again. I think when she is confronted with these accusations, that she was the border czar and I think also that she's going to really follow the line of what the Biden administration did, particularly because as we know, border crossings and all of those things at the border are down right now.\n\nAnd it has led the administration to feel like they've been doing what is right. But from day one, they called on Congress to step in and formally change what is happening at the border, to lessen the pressure on the border and lessen migration. But I think just going back to the foremost point that she is not incorrect in that interview that she gave to Astead because she was not tasked with the border.\n\nShe was tasked with figuring out the root cause of migration in diplomacy in Central America. Now that is a mouthful and I don't think it ever translated that to that, particularly because Republicans from March 2021, after Biden gave her this issue, that again, he dealt with similarly when he was vice president to then Barack Obama.\n\nRepublicans were very good at making sure that was a political loser for the vice president, and it's something at the time that I reported on, that her office was adamant that they did not want on her portfolio. Because they felt like it would be such a big deal. Fast forward to now, of course, it is one of the main issues that Republicans continue to whack the vice president over again and again, this relationship that she had potentially being the border czar, as they say, her office says that they weren't.\n\nSo I think that this is going to be an issue that continues to follow her throughout November. And then even if she is successful in November while in office, just because this is something that President Biden wanted her to do, something that at the time her aides did not want her to do.\n\nAnd they felt like potentially the West Wing wasn't thinking about how it would play right now. But of course, it happened. And this is something that she's stuck with.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: And of course, being charged with doing what one can to stem root causes of migration in other countries. Even if you were wildly successful, that is not a problem you'd feel the effects of a solution for many years.\n\nDefinitely not within a presidential election cycle.\n\nWRIGHT: Oh, I was just gonna say, and I think if you look at back to what she had done in office on that issue, it was things like expanding Wi-Fi and broadband in some of those regions. It was things like private and public partnerships with major corporations like Coca Cola to get more funds and to start small businesses, to enrich like coffee farms and things like that.\n\nSo her actions were very much so focused in that region and not on things that would happen on the border. But again, I think that this is an issue that's just going to continue to follow her.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So professor Austin and there's no doubt that issues about the border will continue to follow whomever is in the White House.\n\nAfter the November election, but particularly for a Democratic nominee, it's an extremely thorny one, right? Because Jasmine's right, right now, border crossings have gone down, but basically between 2021 to the end of 2023, they were on the rise. And we did several shows on how as many of those migrants were then moved to Northern cities, we looked at Chicago for example.\n\nIn fact, in those places, it was Black residents who were particularly concerned that resources that should have gone to their communities were being used to handle the migrants coming in. So I'm just wondering, like, how do you see Harris, the border and migration in terms of her potential pitfalls as a presidential candidate.\n\nAUSTIN: I think the border issue is going to be the most troubling issue for her. Simply because even during the assassination attempt, that's what Donald Trump was talking about. Some of the data that he's been showing is basically false, but the problem that she's running into is that when your opponent makes an accusation, it doesn't have to be true.\n\nHe just has to convince people to believe that it's true. And the common belief is that the Biden administration dropped the ball on the issue of the border. And as Jasmine said, the border crossings have come down, but nevertheless that is an issue that she was sent. It was said that she was the border czar, we now know that wasn't necessarily true, but that's what a lot of people believe.\n\nSo this is going to be a really troubling issue for her. But I think that the more she gives interviews and she appears at rallies, but especially when she starts giving more media interviews and when she clarifies her positions on the border. And also, if and when hopefully this will happen, that she debates Donald Trump, she'll be able to address a lot of those allegations and bring out the facts. Because a lot of people do believe that she was the border czar and there were a lot more border crossings under the Biden administration.\n\nAnd now those border crossings have gone down, but a lot of people are still looking at her and pointing the finger at her for not handling that situation correctly.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Jasmine, let me turn back to you on something. Because I think you said that as far as we can tell thus far, Vice President Harris says not only is she aligned with what the current policies of the Biden administration are, but that perhaps she would continue to advance them should she be president.\n\nTo be clear, I think it was back in February. Biden promised to quote, shut down the U.S.-Mexico border. If Congress had passed that immigration compromise, that a bipartisan group of senators had been working on, of course, that never happened, right? As you mentioned, that immigration bill just died a sad death.\n\nBut the fact that the president even promised to shut down the border was quite a different tone than he had taken on before. So do you know, do you get a sense if the vice president was aligned with that?\n\nWRIGHT: Yeah, I think it shows just how serious that the issue was at the time and how politically damaging it was for the president.\n\nAgain, I think that the vice president didn't want to get anywhere near the border issue, particularly because of those border czar accusations or labeling her of it. So really the president was handling the issues of the border on his own, because that in the vice president's office view, was not her domain.\n\nShe was handling the root causes. Now, I think you could very well argue that whatever the president was doing for the most part of those three years in office, the vice president was, as his partner, behind and supportive and was never going to publicly distance herself from. But again, I think that they were very clear and very careful throughout those three years to make sure that she didn't really have, she couldn't be accused of being the border czar, even though it so happened, because she wasn't working on the border.\n\nNow, in terms of going forward, we know that she is now back the Biden administration's budget request for increasing funding for border enforcement. So I think that's important. It's just going to be an ongoing conversation of how closely she sticks to what President Biden did in the last year on immigration and whether or not she distances herself from it is, I think, a question to come, she is his number two and she, her mentality throughout this whole three years is that she's wanted to be loyal, supportive of Biden.\n\nIf she had any problems, she wanted to voice them privately. And I don't think that I, at least from what I've heard, that there was any major differences on her opinions and how the White House was handling the border issue at the times when it was so severe.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Okay. Okay. That is good to know.\n\nSo let's move on to criminal justice, right? Because this is a really interesting part of trying to understand the vice president's beliefs. Because of course, a major part of her career was as attorney general for the state of California. And she is now making that prosecutorial experience a major part of her 2024 race.\n\nBut of course, back in 2020, it was something of an albatross for her, because many progressives were quite critical of her tough on crime stance as a California AG, including her crackdown on truancy when she was Attorney General of California.\n\nHARRIS: Last year alone, we had 600,000 truant students in our elementary schools, which roughly matches the number of inmates in our state prison system.\n\nAnd is it a coincidence? Of course not. And as unacceptable as this problem is, I know we can fix it. In San Francisco, we threatened the parents of truants with prosecution and truancy dropped 32%. So we are putting parents on notice. If you fail to take responsibility for your kids, we are going to make sure that you face the full force and consequences of the law.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: So that was Kamala Harris as Attorney General for the state of California. Professor Austin, talk to me about your thinking on how you've seen Kamala Harris on criminal justice issues. Is this another point of evolution for her, or once a prosecutor, always a prosecutor?\n\nAUSTIN: I would say it's a point of evolution, but it all depends on how the public perceives her.\n\nShe calls herself a progressive prosecutor, but a lot of progressives even now are still hesitant about supporting her because of some of the actions that she made during the time that she was both the prosecutor and California Attorney General. Especially the fact that her office didn't really, they didn't endorse a bill back in 2015 to investigate police shootings.\n\nThere was another issue that involved body cameras and there could have been a law to mandate or to require that police officers wore body cameras, and she didn't support that. And there are some other things as well that are very troubling in her background. And that is something that I think the Trump campaign is going to bring forward, because now she is thought of as a progressive.\n\nShe just recently got an endorsement from the progressive caucus in Congress. But as a prosecutor, that's the type of job that it is. On one hand, it could work against her. When people look at some of the things that I've mentioned, but in a way, it could also work to her advantage, because there's a stereotype that women are soft on crime, and she was anything but when she was a prosecutor.\n\nAnd then as far as the truancy issue, that was something that as the clip just said, truancy went way down because children were not attending school and she threatened to prosecute the parents if they didn't send them to school. And as a result, they started doing so. So in a way, it could work to her advantage because she can show that the stereotype that we have of women as being soft on crime and not really knowing what to do, she is not like that.\n\nSo I guess it could work both to her advantage and to her disadvantage.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Now, of course, to state the obvious, in 2020 it was the country was still roiling in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd and policing, criminal justice, racism reached and the nation's engagement with these important issues reached a fever pitch.\n\nProfessor Austin, do you see things, as the questions around criminal justice, being a little bit different now than they were in that particular moment in 2020?\n\nAUSTIN: I would say yes, because in 2020, as you mentioned, there was a lot of a focus on racial justice after the murder of George Floyd.\n\nAnd it was more of an enthusiastic effort to try to look into racial justice and to find the root causes of it than I've ever seen in my lifetime. But now that's sort of fallen by the wayside. And now we don't really hear very many people talking about racial justice, nearly as much.\n\nAlthough we do hear it somewhat with Sonya Massey, the African American woman who was recently murdered in her home by a police officer. But it's not the same type of energy. The same type of fever pitch that we saw in 2020. So I think that now there's not as much of a focus on racial justice.\n\nIf anything, there's been a backlash with all of the anti DEI movements. Even she has been called a DEI hire, legislation in different states that are being passed to regulate and mandate the way that you talk about race, removing books and that type of thing. So now we're in a totally different type of climate than existed in 2020.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Jasmine, we've got a minute before the next break here, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on Harris and criminal justice.\n\nWRIGHT: Yeah. I think back in 2019, if you go back and look at the timeline, it was either right before or right after she announced her candidacy, a big op-ed about her time as attorney general came out.\n\nAnd it totally made them back away from her prosecutorial record, which I would argue is what is so central to her, being a prosecutor. That's the way that she thinks. And that's the way that she operates. And that's the way that people knew her the best. And so it befuddled us in 2019 when she did that. But of course, now 2024, it is something that is paramount on her list of attributes that she shows to people, particularly when she takes on Donald Trump. And so I think it'll be interesting to see how far that expands and how far that evolves. But I would agree with the professor that it's not so much the vice president that has evolved on her own record, but the American --\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Just a second here, Jasmine, we've got to take a break.\n\nPart III\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Professor Austin, we've got to let you go here in just a second, but I wanted to ask you one last question, and that is, of the major issues that a president must address as a leader of the American people, is there any particular issue that you haven't yet heard enough from Kamala Harris on, and that you yourself don't fully think you understand?\n\nWhat she believes about that issue and would want to know more about.\n\nAUSTIN: I would say that the economy, she needs to focus more so on Joe Biden's successes during his term in office, because if she is saying that she's going to continue Biden's policy, Donald Trump's gonna attack her on that.\n\nBecause he is trying to paint Joe Biden as a failure when it comes to the economy, but he has a relatively successful record. And so I think that she really needs to, instead of all these attacks back and forth, she really does need to tell people more about some of the things that Joe Biden achieved in terms of the lower unemployment, as far as reminding people of how things were during the pandemic.\n\nAnd he was able to bring us out of that. It's as far as inflation going up, but then passing the Inflation Reduction Act. Which is bringing inflation down and those types of things, because I think that's what people are more concerned about, not so much the insults or the jokes or that type of thing.\n\nBut I think people are more concerned with the fact that how is she going to make it so that we will have jobs and prosperity in this country. So I think she really does need to focus more so on those types of issues.\n\nCHAKRABARTI: Sharon Austin, Professor of Political Science at the University of Florida, currently at work on a book about Black women and the presidency.\n\nProfessor Austin, it's been a great pleasure.

We will take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases. And we will take on big pharma to cap prescription drug costs for all Americans.\"\n\nHarris was joined by Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, former Rep. Stacey Abrams, and several other special guests, including Migos rapper Quavo and a graduate of Morehouse College, a historically Black university.\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion performed at the Atlanta rally, getting the crowd energized with a performance of her hit song \"Savage\" and praising Harris as the would-be first Black, female president.\n\nOn a call with reporters ahead of her trip, Harris' campaign said Georgia, a formerly red state that voted blue in the last presidential election, is still \"in play.\"\n\n\"The vice president is energizing and mobilizing our base,\" said Dan Kanninen, the campaign's battleground states director. \"Having a candidate who can mobilize our key Biden-Harris coalition, talking about the issues that resonate with Georgians ... make that state in play.\"\n\nSince President Joe Biden announced earlier this month that he was leaving the 2024 race, Harris has secured commitments from enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee if they all honor their commitment when voting, according to ABC News reporting.\n\nThe trip to Georgia comes as the campaign reported raising $200 million in less than a week since Biden dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. The campaign is also boasting 170,000 new volunteers who have signed up to back Harris. This past weekend to commemorate the 100-day mark from November's election, the campaign hosted 2,300 events across the battleground states with more than 29,000 volunteers participating.\n\nHarris' remarks at the rally followed a meeting with local reproductive rights leaders and activists.\n\nGeorgia played a crucial role in Biden's 2020 victory, going blue for the first time since 1992 due, in significant part, to organizing efforts from Abrams, who spent years spearheading get-out-the-vote efforts in Black communities. Harris' campaign will be looking to replicate success in Georgia by shoring up support among Black voters, a key group of voters that both Harris and Trump will work to connect with as the November election approaches.\n\nBiden only won the state by some 12,000 votes in 2020, a win heavily contested by Trump, who is currently in the midst of an election interference case in the state. Trump hasn't held a campaign event in Georgia since his debate with Biden in June.\n\nKanninen said that although the Harris campaign has achieved an impressive fundraising haul in a short amount of time, they are not getting \"comfortable.\"\n\n\"I continue to be very clear with our partners and with our own staff. This campaign will not get comfortable. We jumped in with just 100 days ago against an opponent who has shown he's willing to do anything to win,\" said Kannien. \"This is going to be an incredibly close race just like it was in 2020. But just like four years ago, we are going to win this thing.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign told reporters they expect the state to be just as \"competitive\" this election, claiming that their infrastructure in the state gives them an advantage.\n\n\"We expect it to be as close as competitive this year,\" said Communications Director Michael Tyler. \"That's why we have the team and the operation in place to make sure that we can turn out every single Harris voter in the state of Georgia.\"\n\nAccording to the campaign, they have more than 170 coordinated staff and 24 offices across the state with three of those opening this past weekend. The Trump campaign only recently opened its first campaign office in the state in June.\n\n\"We're making these investments across the entire map because the data is clear. We have multiple pathways to 270 electoral votes,\" said Kanninen. \"The vice president is strong in both the blue wall and in the Sun Belt and we are running hard in both.\"", "source": {"uri":

He plans to lead Project 2025 going forward. Democrats have made the project a key election-year cudgel, pointing to the ultraconservative policy blueprint as a glimpse of how extreme another Trump administration could be.\n\nTrump's campaign has announced that he will travel to Atlanta on Saturday for a rally in the same venue where Vice President Kamala Harris held one Tuesday night.\n\nDueling ad campaigns by the presidential candidates portray the Democratic Harris as \"fearless,\" while an ad from Republican Trump blasts the vice president for problems at the southern U.S. border.\n\nAnd Trump said in an interview Tuesday on radio station WABC that Harris \"doesn't like Jewish people\" and appeared to agree with a host who called her Jewish husband, Doug Emhoff, \"a crappy Jew.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris appears to have energized Democrats in the early days of her candidacy, with the surge in warm feelings extending across multiple groups, including some key Democratic constituencies that had been tepid about President Joe Biden, according to a new poll.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 Democrats say they would be very or somewhat satisfied if Harris became the Democratic nominee for president. The survey from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was conducted after Biden withdrew from the race.\n\nThe rapidly changing views among Democrats in such a short time span underscore how swiftly the party has coalesced behind Harris as its standard-bearer.\n\nKari Lake has won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Arizona, setting up a fierce battle against Democratic U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego for a seat that could be crucial to deciding Senate control.\n\nLake on Tuesday defeated Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who had contended he was more electable and the best candidate to secure the border. But Lamb ultimately struggled to raise the money needed to make his case to voters.\n\nGallego ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for Senate. Lake, a former local news anchor, built a national profile in Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement with an unsuccessful 2022 bid for Arizona governor.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a cheering, boisterous, packed Atlanta arena Tuesday that the next 98 days will be a fight, but that she will win come November.\n\nShe taunted Donald Trump for wavering on whether he would show up for their upcoming debate. In Georgia, the state that delivered Biden his narrowest victory margin in 2020, Harris mocked her rival and Trump's running mate JD Vance as \"just plain weird,\" and derided their policies as backward, outdated and dangerous.\n\nHarris will travel to battleground states next week with her yet-to-be-named running mate, according to an itinerary from the campaign. Campaign officials stress that the vice president has not yet made her decision, but the schedule confirms her plans to announce it soon.\n\nThe newly announced Democratic ticket will appear together in Philadelphia; western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix and Las Vegas.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"},

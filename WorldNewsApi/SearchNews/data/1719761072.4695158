According to him, the development sends a sense of brotherhood despite differences in tribe and tongues. Akpabio stated this on Wednesday during a joint sitting of the National Assembly to celebrate the one year anniversary of President Bola Tinubu's administration. He said Tinubu had done well in the last one year, noting that it was profound that the old national anthem was re-introduced during his first year in office. \u201cOf all the significant things you have done, there is one of the most profound things and that is to take us back to our genealogy. \u201cThe genealogy of our birth that though we belong to different tribes, though we may have different tongues, henceforth, we will not refer to ourselves as just compatriots, we will refer to ourself as brothers and as we move forward in battle or on the field of sports or other endeavours, we must hail Nigeria.\"\" In what he described as \u201cwaka pass\u201d, Akpabio said Tinubu visited the National Assembly as a mark of the respect he has for the parliament. \u201cBefore you came, myself and my brother, Rt. Hon. Tajudeen Abass explained the purpose of this visit. \"In Nollywood, what you have just done is what they call \u201cwaka pass\u201d. Yu intend to celebrate Democracy Day which is June 12, but out of honour and respect for the National Assembly, you said you must pass through the National Assembly on your first anniversary. \u201cThere is no better place to commence this revolution than going back to our genealogy. \"In the National Assembly, we are not just representatives, but elected representatives of Nigerians. The voice of the National Assembly is the voice of Nigeria.\u201d Reacting, Tinubu thanked the lawmakers for their understanding and cooperation, describing lawmakers as rare leaders that Nigeria has been looking for. \u201cI came to say thank you very much. You are first and foremost leaders that speak for our people. You have been in the forefront of this struggle. This institution of hallowed chambers represents our consciousness for freedom and sense of belonging. \"You rolled out the latest National Anthem, Nigeria we hail thee. This is our diversity.\u201d", "summary": "<img width=\"1000\" height=\"525\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Senate-President-Akpabio.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Senate-President-Akpabio.jpg 1000w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Senate-President-Akpabio-300x158.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><p>Senate President Godswill Akpabio says the introduction of the old national anthem, &#8216;Nigeria we hail thee&#8217; marks the beginning of the revolution that Nigerians have been yearning for.

{"id": 243232270, "title": "The UK city that claims to be 'the most haunted in Europe' with 500 ghosts", "text": "With a storied past of Romans, Vikings, and violence, it's perhaps unsurprising that York would find its way onto lists of haunted places in Britain, but somewhat more surprising is the claim that it's the most haunted city in Europe. The city, which was first named Eboracum by the Romans in 71 AD, has numerous stories of hauntings, including claims that perhaps not all the Romans left in 400 AD. In the 1950s numerous people who visited Treasurer\u2019s House claimed to have seen a Roman soldier, with one guest recalling that the ghost blocked her way when looking for wine in the cellar. On another occasion, an apprentice heating engineer claimed to have heard a trumpet blast and then seen a Roman coming through the wall. Rather spookily, excavations on the site later revealed that the house had been built along one of the main Roman roads in the city, and was located near to the former Roman headquarters. The Roman soldier in the Treasurer\u2019s House is just one of a reported 500 hauntings within the city's walls. A rather sadder ghost story is that of Mad Alice, who is said to haunt Lund\u2019s Court, which was previously named Mad Alice Lane. A woman named Alice Smith is said to have lived on the lane in the 1800s, and in 1825 she was hanged from York Castle for the crime of 'insanity' after she killed her abusive husband. Some people claim that they have seen Alice's face looking at them from the windows looking down on the alley. Another tragic tale is that of the Grey Lady who reportedly haunts the York Theatre Royal, which was built on the site of the medieval St Leonard\u2019s Hospital. The Grey Lady, who is thought to have served as the inspiration for one of the ghosts in Harry Potter, is said to have been a nun called who fell in love with one of her nobleman patients. After this forbidden romance was discovered, the nun was thrown into a windowless room and bricked in, with no chance of escape. While this is certainly a macabre story, sightings of the Grey Lady are now said to be a good omen, suggesting that the night's performance will be particularly good. Other ghosts that are said to be haunting York are Royalist soldiers who workers and patrons of the Ye Olde Starre Inne claim to have heard screaming in the basement. This might seem a rather strange haunting for pub, but the basement of Ye Olde Starre Inne was used as a makeshift hospital during the English Civil War. These are just some of the ghosts rumoured to be haunting York, with the huge number of reported ghosts sightings leading to it being labelled the most haunted city in Europe.

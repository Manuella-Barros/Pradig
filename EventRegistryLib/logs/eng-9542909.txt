The 25-year-old signed a 1-year extension to stay in New England this offseason, but the former CFL star became a victim of the numbers game.\n\nThe Patriots have completely revamped their quarterback position this offseason. After signing veteran Jacoby Brissett in free agency, the team drafted two quarterbacks in the 2024 NFL Draft with Drake Maye at No. 3 and Joe Milton III in the sixth round. Those moves gave the Patriots five quarterbacks on their roster with Brissett, Bailey Zappe, Maye, Milton and Rourke.\n\nThose moves led to speculation that Zappe might be on the move. After the Patriots drafted Milton, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport said Zappe is \"likely available in a trade if it makes sense.\"\n\nHead coach Jerod Mayo was asked about the possibility of a Zappe trade after the conclusion of the draft.\n\n\"That's yet to be seen,\" Mayo said. \"At this current time, look, we're still on the phone right now with potential free agents coming up here soon. We'll see how all the dominos kind of play out. But at the same time, you want to have a strong group. You want to have a strong room. I would say, the way it looks now, we have a very strong room.\"\n\nIn the end, the first post-draft quarterback move was the release of Rourke.\n\nHe starred in the CFL, playing for the BC Lions. In 2022, he won the CFL's Most Outstanding Canadian Award, given to the best Canadian player in the league. That year, he led the CFL in passing yards (3,349) and passing touchdowns (25). That effort earned him multiple NFL tryouts and he signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars during the 2023 offseason.\n\nLast year, Rourke spent time on both the Jaguars practice squad and 53-man roster. On Dec. 16, he was waived by Jacksonville and two days later, claimed by the Patriots.\n\nRourke spent most of his time in New England as the No. 3 quarterback behind Zappe and Mac Jones.

pick.\n\nRourke, 25, went undrafted out of Ohio in 2021 and was a second round draft selection in the CFL Draft in 2020.\n\nRourke spent three seasons at Ohio, passing for 7,457 yards with 60 touchdowns and only 20 interceptions.\n\nHe went on to play in the CFL with the British Columbia Lions, where he spent two seasons and started in 12 games.\n\nIn those 12 games, Rourke passed for 4,103 yards with 28 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.\n\nRourke chose to make the leap to the NFL in 2023, signing with the Jaguars after garnering interest from multiple teams.\n\nHe went to their practice squad but was later waived and claimed by the Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots no longer had a need for Rourke after drafting two quarterbacks and signing one in free agency.\n\nTheir QB room now consists of Maye, Jacoby Brissett, Bailey Zappe, and Joe Milton.\n\nMaye is the presumed starter going into the 2024 season, being drafted with the No. 3 overall pick.\n\nHowever, head coach Jerod Mayo said there will be an open competition for the starting job during training camp.\n\n\"Look, Jacoby understands, he's a mentor,\" Mayo said to NFL.com's Cameron Wolfe.\n\n\"He's very smart, has great leadership skills, and hopefully Drake can learn something from him, as well.\n\n\"I would say we're going to compete all spring, we're going to compete during training camp, and the best player will start.\"\n\nBrissett and Maye are likely guarantees to make the Patriots roster, but one of Milton and Zappe could find themselves off the team by the time the season rolls around.", "source":

However, with the selection of Drake Maye and Joe Milton into a QB room in a unit that already had Jacoby Brissett and Bailey Zappe, it was hard to see the Patriots carry five signal callers into camp.

Now, it has taken another, as the New York Giants have claimed him off waivers and will sign him to a contract. Once there, it will be interesting to see what position the Giants assign Rourke.\n\nHe was a quarterback in New England, even if only briefly and never on the active 53-man roster. Rourke began last season with the Jaguars, but underwent foot surgery last January. He stuck with Jacksonville through camp and pulled off one of the highlights of the entire NFL preseason when he broke four tackles and threw a touchdown pass against the Cowboys in August.\n\nBut the Jags bumped him to the practice squad and eventually cut him all together in December. The Patriots picked him up immediately after, and put Rourke on the practice squad. They re-signed him in March but released him this week.\n\nRourke has a fascinating history for a player who is still only 25 years old and has never thrown an NFL pass. He is a native of Canada and played collegiately at Ohio, twice winning the Jon Cornish trophy for the top Canadian player in the NCAA. He was a top dual-threat quarterback, and scored 109 touchdowns in three years, 60 by air and 49 as a runner.\n\nComing form college, he was not drafted by an NFL team but was a second-round pick by the BC Lions of the CFL. He wound up starting for the Lions in 2022 and set a CFL record with a 78.7% completion rate. Despite missing much of the season with a Lisfranc injury that required surgery on his foot, Rourke was named the CFL's Most Outstanding Player.\n\nThat has not quite transferred to NFL success, of course, but Rourke is obviously a commodity that has gotten some attention around the league. He is a top-shelf athlete and, before starting his career in the CFL, he worked out for the New York Giants -- as a receiver.\n\nRourke at least has the makings of an exhibition game star. In three games in the 2023 preseason, he went 23-for-35 passing with 348 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed for 39 yards and a touchdown, though he did commit two fumbles.\n\nThe Patriots enter 2024 in a much different position, quarterback-wise, than they were in for much of 2023, when Mac Jones disappointed and Bailey Zappe did not do much behind him. For a brief period, Rourke was the No. 3 option for a team whose Top 2 were in danger of being booted from the league.\n\nJones is gone to Jacksonville now. Zappe is still on hand, but the starting battle will be down to Jacoby Brissett and rookie Drake Maye, with sixth-round pick Joe Milton the third option.\n\nThat is likely to mean the end of the line for Zappe, who was a fourth-round pick in 2022 and made eight starts in two seasons with the Patriots. New England has not yet made a move on Zappe, but it's a longshot that he will be on the roster, even the practice squad, next year.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_deveney@heavy.com", "name": "Sean Deveney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rourke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Rourke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisfranc_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lisfranc injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Cornish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Cornish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BC Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFL's_Most_Outstanding_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1880930004-e1715187900198.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542909", "eventUri": "eng-9542909", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Yet to see an NFL snap\n\nRourke entered the NFL in 2023 after working out for several teams during the offseason following the CFL season. He signed on with the Jacksonville Jaguars, spending time on both the active roster and practice squad. He also spent some time with the New England Patriots before being waived on Monday. He has yet to see a snap in an NFL game.\n\n2. Canadian Football Career\n\nAfter his collegiate career at Ohio ended, Rourke was a second-round pick in the 2020 CFL draft. He spent two seasons with the BC Lions -- the 2020 season was canceled. In 22 games (starts), Rourke completed 76% of his passes for 4,035 yards, 28 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.

The latest transaction saw quarterback Nathan Rourke get waived.\n\nA waiver wire pickup from the Jacksonville Jaguars last December, Rourke began his Patriots career as a third-string QB behind Bailey Zappe and Mac Jones. He remained in that role until the season finale, when he was put ahead of former first-round draft pick Jones to serve as the primary backup in a loss to the New York Jets.\n\nDespite his upgrade in status for that game, Rourke leaves New England with zero in-game reps. Here is a look at what his release means for the club.\n\nFollowing a series of offseason moves, the Patriots were left with five quarterbacks on their roster. Besides Rourke, they also had the aforementioned Bailey Zappe under contract and furthermore added Jacoby Brissett in free agency as well as Drake Maye and Joe Milton via the draft.\n\nRourke no longer being a part of this group doesn't drastically change its outlook. Jacoby Brissett and Drake Maye are still expected to compete for the starting role this season, with the others competing for a maximum of one spot on the 53-man roster. That competition was three players deep heading into this week, but it is now down to Zappe and Milton.\n\nThe word \"projected\" is used here because all of the undrafted rookie signings at this point are unofficial and have only been reported, but not announced by the club. Still, if we account for those reports plus any additional post-draft movement by the Patriots we find them with 89 of 90 roster spots filled.\n\nAssuming that number is indeed accurate, the question becomes how that final spot will be filled. New England will host its rookie minicamp later this week, so maybe one of the 11 known invitees will get the opportunity to sign a contract.\n\nUnder NFL offseason rules, only the 51 biggest cap hits plus additional guarantees count against a team's books at this time of the year. Given that Rourke neither fell in that first category -- his cap number was just $915,000 -- nor had any such guarantees in his contract, his release does not impact the Patriots' salary cap.\n\nAccording to cap expert Miguel Benzan, New England has $50.49 million to work with at the moment. That number is clearly the highest in the team, and one that will change over the next few months and throughout the season. Whatever is then left can be rolled over into 2025, when the Patriots are already projected to again lead the NFL in cap space.\n\nIncluding both internal and external signings, the Patriots reached agreements with 22 players since mid-March. Among those, 21 remain on the team; Rourke is the only exception.\n\nThe 25-year-old originally entered the offseason as an exclusive rights free agent, meaning that only the Patriots were allowed to extend an offer to him before the start of the new league year. They did just that, keeping him on a one-year contract at that $915,000 number mentioned above. However, the nature of that deal plus his standing on the quarterback depth chart even before the draft made him a likely cut candidate.", "source": {"uri": "patspulpit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pats Pulpit"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bernd_buchmasser@patspulpit.com", "name": "Bernd Buchmasser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rourke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Rourke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YCFOsz99sjtSg5dMNEhGY6OKkQw=/0x199:3112x1755/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25435861/1910393608.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542909", "eventUri": "eng-9542909", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

They weren't going to take reps away from their promising young signal-callers for Rourke.\n\nHowever, things might not be as cut and dry for Zappe, who has started eight games in total for the Patriots over the last two seasons. Veteran Jacoby Brissett projects as the top quarterback due to his experience running Alex Van Pelt's offense, while Maye works behind the scenes getting up to speed. But right out of the gates, Zappe should at the very least make the top-three on the depth chart.\n\nMilton isn't a lock as a sixth-round pick, and he's going to have to show more than just a cannon arm to make the roster. The thinking is Zappe will have an opportunity to compete on the practice field.\n\nNow, if Milton has a strong showing throughout the practices, it could put Zappe's roster spot in jeopardy. What happens at quarterback will ultimately be fueled by how far along Maye and Milton are in the process by the end of training camp.\n\nThat alone sets the stage for one of the more intriguing quarterback battles in recent memory. Zappe still has a fighting chance, and it won't be long before we see what he makes of it.", "source": {"uri": "patriotswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Patriots Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordy_mcelroy@patriotswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Jordy McElroy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Cunningham", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malik Cunningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky_Hilltoppers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Van_Pelt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Van Pelt"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://patriotswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2023/12/USATSI_22027519_168403262_lowres.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542909", "eventUri": "eng-9542909", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The team already traded 2021 No. 15 overall selection Mac Jones, and now another domino has fallen as the Patriots announced they are waiving journeyman signal-caller Nathan Rourke.\n\n\"The Patriots informed QB Nathan Rourke that he is being waived, per sources,\" Mike Reiss of ESPN reported on Monday. \"This thins the QB room to 4 -- Jacoby Brissett, Drake Maye, Bailey Zappe and Joe Milton.\"\n\nIt's no surprise at all that Rourke got the ax after the team drafted Drake Maye. Rourke is a 25-year-old Canadian QB who went to Ohio University and had some success right after college in the CFL. For the last two seasons, he has bounced around practice squads and waivers in the NFL with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Patriots.\n\nWith Rourke gone and four QBs remaining, now things get interesting for the Patriots heading toward the 2024 season.\n\nOver the course of the next four months, first-time head coach Jerod Mayo has to figure out two big things. Can Drake Maye start Week 1 for the Pats? And whether he does or not, who will be the temporary starter/primary backup on the roster with Maye?\n\nDrake Maye and the Patriots QB situation heading into the offseason\n\nIdeally, Drake Maye will blow everyone away in mini and training camps and be the unquestioned Patriots starter in Week 1.\n\nIf that happens, then the big competition is for the backup spot. If it doesn't, then it's all about who will start for a few weeks (or maybe even for the season) while Maye develops. Either way, it seems like former Tennessee QB and 2024 sixth-round pick Joe Milton will make the roster as the developmental QB3.\n\nThat leaves the big battle between Jacoby Brissett and Bailey Zappe.\n\nIn 2022, as a fourth-round rookie, Zappe took New England by storm, outplaying incumbent starter Mac Jones and going 2-0 as a starter. However, the next season didn't go nearly as well as Zappe managed just a 2-4 mark in his six starts.\n\nThe Patriots have a new coaching staff, although it isn't that new as Mayo has on been the team's defensive staff since 2019. Offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt is new to Foxborough, though, landing there after working OC jobs with the Buffalo Bills and Cleveland Browns.\n\nWill Van Pelt go with the backup who still has some upside or go all-in on the grizzled veteran on the roster? Brissett has played eight NFL seasons, putting up an 18-30 mark as a starter overall. While the numbers aren't impressive, Brissett is a consummate professional and you know exactly what you're going to get from him. What you're going to get is inconsistency with flashes of brilliance, but he is a QB who can run an offense in a pinch.\n\nNow, all this will be less important if Drake Maye wins the starting job in camp, and could even be moot if Joe Milton shows enough development that the team feels comfortable with him as the backup. If these things happen, both Brissett and Zappe will become expendable.\n\nFor now, though, we know that Nathan Rourke is out, and the Patriots head toward next season with a four-way battle for no more than three roster spots.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_crean@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Tim Crean", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rourke", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Rourke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Volunteers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Volunteers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/College_and_University", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/College and University", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics_Illustrators", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Illustration/Graphics Illustrators", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Patriots-news-New-England-waives-QB-after-Drake-Maye-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542909", "eventUri": "eng-9542909", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Last week, the team drafted Drake Maye, quarterback of the North Carolina Tar Heels, with the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nThe New England Patriots have decided to cut former CFL standout and Most Outstanding Canadian Nathan Rourke just two months after signing him to a contract extension in March to back up former first-round pick Mac Jones, who was presumed to be the Patriots starter before being traded to Jaxonville in 2023.\n\nAlso Read: New England Patriots' Latest Move Makes It Clear They Want Nothing To Do With Bill Belichick And His Legacy Anymore\n\nESPN's Mike Reiss reported, \"The Patriots informed QB Nathan Rourke that he is being waived, per sources.\" After cutting the former CFL standout, four remain in the New England quarterback room: Jacoby Brissett, Drake Maye, Bailey Zappe, and Joe Milton.\n\nRourke signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars after his record-setting 2022 CFL season, in which he put up a staggering 3,349 yards and 25 touchdowns in 10 games and added over 300 yards and seven touchdowns on the ground.\n\nHe is probably best known to NFL fans for his crazy play with the Jaguars during a pre-season game in which he broke four tackles before launching a touchdown throw against the Dallas Cowboys in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaden_harty@totalprosports.com", "name": "Kaden Harty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rourke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Rourke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Tar Heels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1427645870-1-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542909", "eventUri": "eng-9542909", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Of course, the headliners include the trading of Mac Jones to the Jaguars and the arrival of Drake Maye via the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. That said, there have been alterations that this new regime, led by head coach Jerod Mayo and de facto GM Eliot Wolf, continue to make with this position group. That latest comes on Monday with the team releasing veteran Nathan Rourke.\n\nRourke had a brief tenure with New England after being claimed by the club in December following a stint with Jacksonville. He was inactive for two games before dressing as a backup in the regular-season finale. Rourke was initially drafted by the CFL's BC Lions in 2020 following a collegiate career at Ohio. He spent two years with the Lions before making the jump to the NFL last year with the Jaguars.\n\nGiven Rourke's status as a fringe NFL player, the Patriots moving on from him was an expected step, especially after coming out of the draft with two quarterbacks. Even now, New England has a total of four quarterbacks on the offseason's 90-man roster, which will likely be whittled down again by the time the club needs to get to a season-opening 53-man unit. As things stand, the QB room in Foxborough is made up of Maye, Jacoby Brissett, Bailey Zappe and rookie Joe Milton.\n\nWith Maye and Brissett looked at as roster locks, the stage is now set for what could prove to be a training camp battle between veteran Zappe and Milton. The inside edge will likely be given to Milton, who was taken in the sixth round (193 overall) out of Tennessee. He presents the Patriots with a cost-controlled asset at the position over the next four seasons and a developmental quarterback with a tremendous arm. His general skill set also seems to align with Maye's, which also could bode well for his chance to be a backup in short order.\n\nAs for Zappe, he's a holdover from the previous regime under Bill Belichick. He's been given opportunities to start throughout his first two years in the league and the recent results have been lukewarm. In six starts last season, Zappe was 2-4 and completed 59.9% of his passes with more interceptions (nine) than touchdowns (six). The Patriots had also already shown a willingness to cut bait with Zappe as they released him during final roster cuts last summer only to bring him back a short time later. The 25-year-old is in the final year of his contract before hitting restricted free agency. With those factors in mind, it would seem like the Patriots would opt for the project in Milton over Zappe if Mayo ultimately decides to have three quarterbacks on the regular-season roster.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_sullivan@cbssports.com", "name": "Tyler Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rourke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Rourke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BC Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/08/08/dbe889d2-f51a-432e-8acf-eeb6cb8be176/thumbnail/1200x675/917b745a703dfc9fdca120d1c0286d37/bailey-zappe-usatsi-cbs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542909", "eventUri": "eng-9542909", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

He was one of five quarterbacks on the Patriots roster, in a group led by recent No. 3 overall draft pick Drake Maye of North Carolina.\n\nNew England also has veteran Jacoby Brissett, a free agent signing with 48 NFL starts on his resume and a guaranteed $6.5 million in salary for this season, plus two other recent draft picks - 2022 fourth rounder Bailey Zappe, who has appeared in 14 games for the team, and 2024 sixth rounder Joe Milton out of the University of Tennessee.\n\nIt was hard to imagine a situation where there were more obstacles in Rourke's way than with the Patriots, so getting out of New England might actually be a good thing.\n\nRourke became a Patriot late last season when New England claimed him from Jacksonville because it needed a quarterback to fill out its roster until season's end. Given the choice of remaining on the Jaguars practice roster or collecting an NFL paycheque, Rourke took the latter, leaving the team he signed with in January of 2023.\n\nThe highlight of Rourke's time with the Jaguars was his performance in the preseason. With only three quarterbacks on the roster at camp, Rourke saw plenty of playing time behind former No.1 overall draft pick Trevor Lawrence and backup C.J. Beathard.\n\nRourke outplayed Beathard, engineering touchdowns on five of the nine drives he completed. But the backup job was never really a competition, and Rourke was released and cleared waivers before joining Jacksonville's practice squad.\n\nAs for what comes next, getting released nine days after the draft, where teams had the chance to load up on available quarterback talent with picks and college free agency, doesn't do Rourke any favours.\n\nPresumably, he will at least find away into an NFL mini-camp, where he can hope to show enough to be signed for training camp. But Rourke seems like a longshot at best to make a roster for September.\n\nAll indications are that Rourke remains as focused on the NFL as ever and would take whatever opportunity comes his way. But if he's not going to be in an NFL training camp this summer, that's a different story.\n\nRourke turns 26 later this month and hasn't thrown a live pass since the preseason last August. It's hard to think he'd be willing to sit out another 12 months, waiting for the NFL to call, without turning his attention north.\n\nCFL camps open this week, which means teams have built their quarterback depth charts and most of the room under the salary cap has been allocated. It wouldn't be easy for a team to add him to its roster, but it wouldn't be impossible either.\n\nUnder the current CBA, teams are allowed to pay players for marketing, which is an uncapped resource that is also exempt from the salary cap. While the amounts have to be justifiable, based on the player's status and appeal, no player would have more value for marketing purposes than Rourke, given his nationality and standing as winner of the CFL's Most Outstanding Canadian award in 2022.\n\nSo it's safe to think that all nine CFL teams are having a Nathan Rourke conversation this week, just to consider the possibilities should he come north.\n\nThe reality for Rourke is that undrafted quarterbacks without NFL playing time on their resumes need a near perfect storm to hit, and the factors involved are mostly well beyond their control.\n\nIn Jacksonville, that path was easy to see - Lawrence getting hurt and Beathard being lousy. In New England, it was about as clear as trying to see through a windshield in a mud storm.\n\nAnd now? Who knows?\n\nFrom the outset, there were always three possibilities when Rourke made his way to the NFL - that he would succeed, that he would fail, or that he would never get the chance to do either.\n\nRight now it appears the latter of those may be his destiny.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Zappe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Zappe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rourke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Rourke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Tennessee"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Lawrence_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Lawrence (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waivers_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waivers (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.tsn.ca/content/dam/tsn/en/home/images/2024/1/8/ticats-head-coach-milanovich-says-rourke-s-nfl-season-was-a-succ-1-2059691-1704742368676.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542909", "eventUri": "eng-9542909", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

ESPN's Mike Reiss first reported the news.\n\nThe move came after the team selected two quarterbacks in the 2024 NFL Draft, Drake Maye third overall and Joe Milton in round six. The Pats signed veteran Jacoby Brissett in free agency, giving him $5 million USD in guaranteed money on a one-year contract. Bailey Zappe, who started games last season, currently has a spot on the roster.\n\nRourke was claimed off waivers by the Patriots on Dec. 18, 2023, after he was waived by the Jacksonville Jaguars and dressed for the final three games of the season. He was New England's primary backup for their regular season finale but did not see game action. The six-foot-two, 209-pound QB earned $519,668 USD in his first NFL season.\n\nNew England has undergone significant changes this offseason, parting ways with legendary head coach Bill Belichick after a 4-13 campaign. Jerod Mayo, the brother of former CFL linebacker Deron Mayo, has since taken over as head coach.\n\nThe 25-year-old signed with the Jags last off-season after an extensive NFL workout tour. During three preseason games with Jacksonville, he completed 65.7 percent of his passes for 348 yards with one touchdown and zero interceptions while carrying the ball 14 times for 39 yards plus one touchdown. Rourke was waived after training camp but landed on the team's practice roster and was activated for three regular season games.\n\nDuring the 2022 CFL season, Rourke completed 78.7 percent of his passes for 3,349 yards with 25 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions while starting for the B.C. Lions. He ran 39 times for 304 yards (7.8 per carry) and seven touchdowns during 10 regular season games, including nine starts. The Ohio University graduate won the three-down league's Most Outstanding Canadian award despite missing half the season with a Lisfranc injury.\n\nIn January, Rourke said: \"I'm in it for the long run.

As you all know by now, the Giants tried to move mountains to trade up for quarterback Drake Maye in the 2024 NFL Draft. However, he ended up going to the Patriots at No. 3 overall.\n\nAfter striking out on Maye, general manager Joe Schoen decided not to bring in any other QBs via the draft. This happened after he previously said he'd be fine if his QBs room consisted of Daniel Jones, Drew Lock and Tommy DeVito for the 2024 campaign. Well, now there's another QB in town who will be ready to try and fight for a spot.\n\nAccording to NFL insider Tom Pelissero, that'd be signal-caller Nathan Rourke, who was claimed off waivers from New England. This comes after Schoen and Brian Daboll previously extended a minicamp invite to Wabash College QB Liam Thompson. So, yeah, not what we had in mind:\n\nThe NY Giants have claimed QB Nathan Rourke off waivers from the Patriots\n\nRourke was just released by New England and it didn't take long for the G-Men to add him to the roster. The writing was on the wall for Rourke, who signed with the Pats after being released by the Jaguars in December. This offseason, NE drafted both Maye and Joe Milton III.\n\nRourke was in the CFL from 2020-2022 before making his way to Jacksonville and then the Patriots. Now, Rourke will hope to stick around with the Giants, but things aren't in his favor their either, even if he did post the play of the preseason last summer:\n\nLooking ahead to next season for NY, Jones is expected to be QB1, but buzz is growing that Lock could steal the job from him. Then there's DeVito, who somehow helped NY win three consecutive games in 2023 as a former UDFA.\n\nOn paper, we'd guess those would be the three QBs Schoen will end up sticking with. No disrespect to Rourke, but he's the kind of player who might stick around to help get in targets for wideouts, and then end up looking for another job again sooner rather than later.

Rourke spent December 2023 with the Patriots after a record-setting career in the CFL.\n\nHe completed 78.7% of his passes in 2022 with the British Columbia Lions, a CFL record. Rourke won the CFL Most Outstanding Canadian award that year.\n\nTeams carry 2-3 quarterbacks on the 53-man roster, so more cuts will likely be coming in August during training camp. The Patriots could keep a quarterback on the practice squad, which means the team could keep all four of the current quarterbacks.\n\nThat could change if Maye wins the starting job in training camp. New England made major changes on offense with all but one pick going toward offense.\n\nThe Patriots offense majorly struggled in 2023 with just 13.9 points per game and 295.2 yards per contest. Part of whether or not Maye starts right away could come down to how ready the rest of the offense is.\n\n\"That's all out of my control, so I don't really worry about that. I'm excited to have him on the team, and the other guys as well that we drafted and picked up. I think it's going to be good,\" Brissett said via Reiss on May 1. \"Competition brings out the best in all of us, so I'm excited about that part.\"\n\nThat said, the Patriots view Brissett in a mentorship role, too, as Reiss pointed out. Brissett also had familiarity with Maye because Maye's former North Carolina teammate and fellow quarterback Sam Howell played for the Commanders with Brissett last season.\n\n\"I'm a little bit familiar with him, and obviously talking to each other now that we are on the same team. So I'm sure that relationship will grow,\" Brissett said.\n\nNew England will likely keep Brissett regardless of who starts Week 1 or beyond. Milton meanwhile is viewed as a project quarterback.

Rourke was a star for the BC Lions of the CFL in the 2022 season, winning Most Outstanding Canadian honors.\n\nRourke signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2023 and tried to land a backup job behind Trevor Lawrence. He was waived and then signed to Jacksonville's practice squad numerous times before the New England Patriots picked him up late in the 2023 season.\n\nThe Victoria, British Columbia native was released by the Patriots on Monday.

He also had 304 rushing yards and seven rushing scores. The former Ohio Bobcat led the Lions to 12 wins and a trip to the West Final, where they fell to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.\n\nThe Giants decided against drafting Daniel Jones' successor with the No. 6 selection in this year's draft. Instead, they used the pick on LSU Tigers star wide receiver Malik Nabers, giving the New York offense a valuable game-changing weapon.\n\nBut Jones is by no means a lock to finish next season as the Giants' starting quarterback. The team signed former Denver Bronco and Seattle Seahawk Drew Lock as insurance, and Tommy DeVito could see more playing time after displaying brief flashes of brilliance last year.\n\nIt's highly unlikely that Nathan Rourke will see any playing time during the regular season (if he remains on New York's roster by then), but New York has nothing to lose in giving the former CFLer a chance to prove himself as a capable third-stringer.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoegler@totalprosports.com", "name": "Alex Hoegler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rourke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Rourke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BC Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jones_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jones (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Lock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drew Lock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Blue_Bombers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Blue Bombers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Five-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1450194347-2-1-1-1536x845-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542909", "eventUri": "eng-9542909", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

As a dual-threat QB for the Bobcats, Rourke accounted for 109 touchdowns in three seasons, 60 through the air and 49 on the ground, per Sports Reference.\n\nThe Giants initially tried to make the most of Rourke's explosive talents by moving him to wide receiver in 2021, according to Dan Duggan of The Athletic. While Rourke's trial at the team's rookie minicamp didn't work out four years ago, Duggan noted the Giants \"also had him in for a workout late in the 2022 season.\"\n\nThis time Rourke will get his chance to stick on a depth chart set to be headed by veterans Daniel Jones and Drew Lock. It means Rourke is likely to find himself in direct competition with last season's cult hero Tommy DeVito for the third-string job.\n\nRourke's ability to create big plays with his arm and his legs is intriguing for the Giants. His multi-purpose game fits the scheme head coach Brian Daboll and offensive coordinator Mike Kafka already have in place for Jones.\n\nBrief stints with the Jags and Patriots shows Rourke has found it tough to make the grade in the NFL, but his raw skills offer potential. To reach that potential Rourke will need to tap into what made him a dominant force in Canada.\n\nHis exploits included tying a CFL record by scoring five touchdowns in one half while a member of the BC Lions back in 2022.\n\nIt won't be easy for Rourke to convince the Giants of his worth, but the fact this regime is willing to take another look at the player speaks volumes about his talents.\n\nJones remains the key to the Giants' season, but his future hinges on more than a few things. Namely, his ability to stay healthy and protect the football.\n\nBoth things have been challenges Jones has found too difficult to overcome previously. Yet, he won't have much time to finally get things right this season.\n\nLock's arm strength could give him the inside track, but Jones won't relinquish his status without a fight. His recovery from a torn ACL should maintain mobility as a key facet of the offense, something that could also keep Rourke in the mix.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_dudko@heavy.com", "name": "James Dudko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rourke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Rourke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waivers_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waivers (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jones_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jones (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Reference", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Reference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Lock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Lock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Daboll", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Daboll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Kafka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Kafka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BC Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1880930004-e1715116736400.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542909", "eventUri": "eng-9542909", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 453, "textEnd": 458}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The team then provided the biggest surprise of the 2024 NFL Draft when it selected Michael Penix Jr. at No. 8 overall. It was a shocking decision considering they gave Cousins a four-year, $180 million deal.\n\nThe Falcons' quarterback room currently includes Cousins, Penix and Taylor Heinicke, who was their backup in 2023. Even with three on their roster, they had interest adding another signal-caller to the mix. According to ESPN, the Falcons put in a waiver claim this week for former New England Patriots quarterback Nathan Rourke. The New York Giants, however, ended up landing Rourke due to a higher waiver priority.\n\nWhile the Falcons still have the three quarterbacks they started the day with, their attempt to add Rourke shows they are interested in adding another, and we could see this happen down the road. Atlanta has emphasized that longevity and security at the position is crucial, which is why it drafted a quarterback in the first round after signing Cousins.\n\nAlthough Rourke does not have NFL experience, they clearly liked him as a fourth quarterback to bring into camp and compete for a roster spot. After what we've seen the Falcons do this offseason, it's not shocking that they're still working on the quarterback room and focused on security at the position.\n\nRourke was waived Monday by the Patriots, where he spent one season. He joined the Patriots in December after spending time with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He has never appeared in a regular-season NFL game.\n\nBefore playing in the NFL, Rourke played in 22 games, including 11 starts in the CFL.

He previously tried out for the Giants at wide receiver in their 2021 rookie mini-camp, but didn't receive a contract offer. Rourke then returned to the Canadian League for the 2021 and 2022 seasons before leaving for the NFL in 2023. He signed a three-year contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars in January of 2023, and bounced between the Jags' active roster and practice squad over the course of the season.\n\nRourke was claimed by the Patriots on December 18th, 2023 and was a back-up QB for the final weeks of the season. He started as their third quarterback, but was elevated to QB2 ahead of Mac Jones for the Patriots' season finale loss to the Jets.\n\nRouke has yet to take a snap in an NFL game, but he was productive in the CFL.

He runs his own business in Jupiter and has four kids.\n\nBut that's not stopping him from reaching out to help families in East Palestine, Ohio.\n\n\"I don't want to complain about things. I just want to try to fix them because we live in a society I feel like now where everyone just complains to each other and no one actually says hey, here's a solution. Let's do something,\" Rourke says.\n\nIf East Palestine sounds familiar, that's because it's the Ohio town where a train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed and caught fire in February 2023.\n\nA massive environmental cleanup is underway.\n\nRourke is working with an Arizona company to donate 2000 under-the-sink water filtration systems for families there.\n\n\"They're a water filtration company. They make these filters that could help these people and I asked them if they wanted to help and they said yes and it's literally that easy,\" Rourke said.\n\nRourke says Sentry H2O will provide the filtration systems, and Rourke will use his moving trucks to get them to Ohio.\n\n\"It feels good to do good things for good people,\" he said.\n\nNo doubt about it. Rourke is taking on a big project, trying to help those people in Ohio. But this is not the first time he's launched an effort to help others.\n\n\"Let's get this place cleaned up, man.

They then shocked the world by selecting former Washington Huskies quarterback Michael Penix, Jr. in the draft, where they held the eighth overall spot.\n\nAnd now there is Schefter's report that the Falcons also wanted Rourke, causing some to wonder what Atlanta's end game is.\n\nWe'll leave that mystery to our colleagues over at the Falcon Report to decipher, but as far as the Giants are concerned, the team's adding of another quarterback came as no surprise after head coach Brian Daboll, following the conclusion of the 2024 NFL draft, said that the team planned to add another quarterback.\n\nThe reason is simple. Jones is recovering from a torn ACL he suffered last season. While he's making progress in his rehab and expects to be ready for the start of training camp in late July, he's unlikely to be cleared to take his normal workload this spring.\n\nDaboll likes to have three quarterbacks available to split the reps, meaning Lock, DeVito, and Rourke would get the bulk of the reps.\n\nThere's likely another reason the Giants are interested in the former CFL star. Jones most likely won't be cleared to play in the preseason games, so having the extra arm in training camp for those games will allow Daboll to distribute the workload.\n\nAnd let's not forget that DeVito, who surprised many people last season with his play when he went 3-3 as a starter, isn't necessarily a lock for this year's roster. He has earned the right to compete for a spot, but he will need to show he's made progress in those areas in which he was deficient if he's to hold onto his spot on the team.\n\nThe Giants begin their OTAs on May 20 and conclude the off-season program with a three-day mandatory minicamp June 11-13 at the team's East Rutherford, New Jersey headquarters.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rourke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Rourke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Daboll", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Daboll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rutherford,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8001,h_4500,x_0,y_242/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/giants_country/01hxdhj1mtexfya529bq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542909", "eventUri": "eng-9542909", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "dateEnd": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 2387, "textEnd": 2397}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 2308, "textEnd": 2314}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

To merge both universities, we'd lose that,\" Buie said. \"Everyone knows that Saint Augustine's and Shaw University are land rich. To have that discussion regarding land, is not farfetched.\"\n\nThe meeting reportedly included Boulware as well as Saint Augustine's Unviersity Interim President Marcus Burgess, Shaw University leaders, local businessmen and, according to WRAL, Capitol Broadcasting Company CEO Jim Goodmon. Capitol Broadcasting Company is the parent company of WRAL.\n\nBoulware stated he rejected the merger proposal, but the idea of this meeting isn't sitting well with Buie and other alum like Marlon Lee.\n\n\"These are people who really personally, I think, don't have our best interest,\" Lee said.\n\nShaw University markets itself as the oldest HBCU in the south. It was founded in 1865 along South Street, which is now downtown Raleigh. The HBCU sits on premier real estate within steps of the Martin Marietta Center for Performing Arts and blocks away from the Red Hat Amphitheatre.\n\nSEE ALSO | Development prospects around Shaw, Saint Augustine's draw mixed reactions\n\nAt the helm of the university's leadership is its 18th president, Dr. Paulette Dillard, who also is board chair of the Downtown Raleigh Alliance.\n\n\"I just hope ShawU does fact checking and questions their president and board. Same way we're doing over here,\" Lee said.\n\nBoulware alleged that at the meeting Goodmon said, \"Raleigh doesn't need two Black universities. We need the two to merge. Don't care what you call it. However, we need them both on SAU's property, because we need downtown land to expand the development footprint.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of history there.

According to his letter, the driving force is an effort to seize the downtown land that Shaw University has sat on since its inception back in 1867.\n\nBoulware cited a dinner meeting involving himself, Saint Augustine's University Interim President Marcus Burgess and \"executives of another local higher education institution\" along with the owner of a local television station, the former editor of the local newspaper. Both the television owner, editor and a developer were unnamed in his letter, dated June 17.\n\n\"Let's get to the bottom of this,\" the television station owner said, according to the document. \"Raleigh doesn't need two black universities. We need the two of them to merge. I don't care what you call it.

You need to consider this an option.\"\n\nBoulware says the other institutions' president didn't say much other than she was \"going to reserve judgement.\" It went on to state that a member of the other university's board had floated the idea to his predecesor at Saint Aug, but it was not taken seriously.\n\nThe letter states that intense dialogue followed along with the rejection of the proposal. Boulware's letter states that following the dinner \"a targeted campaign against SAU ensued.\"\n\nSaint Augustine's University has been in the news frequently over the last fiscal year regarding issues with its finances and accreditation. Bur Shaw University has fared better, but it does sit on valuable downtown real estate at a time when the city leadership is pushing to reshape the area.\n\nEarlier this year the Downtown Raleigh Alliance (DRA) brought a plan to revitalize the growing city's downtown to city leaders.

In fact, he had said at one point that he would never accept such a deal -- and reiterated it last week, describing his release as a \"forced deportation.\"\n\nUnlike many Kremlin critics, Yashin had long refused to leave Russia despite mounting pressure from the authorities, arguing that his voice would sound weaker from abroad. He stayed even after the invasion in 2022 and hastily adopted laws criminalizing any public criticism of it.\n\nHe told AP that his newfound freedom has left him feeling conflicted.\n\nOn one hand, there's \"a massive surge of enthusiasm, massive inspiration and a lot of joy,\" Yashin said.\n\n\"For the first time in over two years ... I don't need to wake up at 5 a.m. after being ordered to wake up, I don't need to walk with my hands behind my back, there are no bars, fences and barbed wire around, I can breathe in fresh air, eat what I want, call whoever and whenever I want,\" Yashin said. \"This feeling of freedom, it's inebriating.\"\n\nOn the other hand, when he thinks about scores of other people still languishing in prisons and jails in Russia, \"it feels like I'm getting hit in the head with a hammer.\"\n\nWorking to swap more of them is now part of Yashin's focus. There are so many more worthy of freedom than himself, the dissident believes, especially those whose emotional and physical health is rapidly deteriorating behind bars.\n\nHe also wants to stay in touch with Russian emigres abroad and advocate for them with Western officials, as well as put forward projects that Kremlin foes could unite around.\n\nBut Yashin sees his main mandate as reaching as many people inside Russia as he can -- and not just those who oppose the war, but those who support it, too.\n\n\"We need to talk to them, and we need to pull these people out of the shackles of Putin's propaganda,\" Yashin told the Berlin rally on Wednesday. \"We need to explain that this monstrous war against Ukraine ... is a war against Russia too, because this war is crippling ... entire generations. It is taking away the future of our country.\"\n\nHe has faced criticism for urging a cease-fire in one of his first interviews after release, but says it will not deter him.\n\n\"I feel responsibility for what is happening and want to prove ... to Russians that this war is harmful for Russia, that it a tragedy for both Ukraine and Russia,\" Yashin said.\n\nGetting through to those who support the Kremlin \"will be an important step to stop the aggression,\" he said.\n\nYashin intends to use his YouTube channel, which has nearly 1.7 million followers, but admits it could be difficult because Russian authorities reportedly are slowing down the platform that is a vital conduit there for critical voices at a time when most independent media and Western social platforms have been blocked.\n\nHe said at some point, he will need to take a pause to sort out his life in Germany, assemble a team and find time to rest and recuperate after prison.\n\nOver two years behind bars took a toll on his physical and mental state, Yashin admitted. He has noticed, for example, that he slouches more often after many nights on an uncomfortable cot in solitary confinement. Although there are other health issues he must address, he says he is \"fine\" overall.\n\nHe said he got a big emotional boost from Wednesday's rally, that drew hundreds of his supporters.\n\n\"The atmosphere there was absolutely amazing,\" Yashin added. \"I recharged with the warm, lively energy from the people, which will definitely help me adjust more than any therapists, any beaches and any

This is how my friend Alexei Navalny showed us Putin's hypocrisy | Ilya Yashin\n\n\"If you can find the strength and desire, please engage in anti-war education,\" he told the crowd. \"Try to return to Russia at least in your thoughts and your communications, because our people are there and we have to talk to them, we have to pull them out of the world of pro-Putin propaganda.\"\n\nThe next day, he met the Guardian in a cafe near the Berlin hotel that now serves as his temporary base. He admitted he was still somewhat disoriented, a week after the exchange that unexpectedly gave him his freedom. Two weeks ago, he was in a Russian prison cell two years into an eight-and-a-half-year sentence and he still makes regular doubletakes, struck anew by the sudden, dramatic transition.\n\n\"I hope that next week I will be able to find an apartment, move out of the hotel and unpack some of the things my mum brought me from Moscow. I need to orient myself, remember how to eat breakfast, work out where to go for a walk, how to use public transport. Everything is new, I need time to adapt,\" he said.\n\nYashin, now 41, was arrested in 2022 over comments he made in one of his regular video streams, in which he discussed Russian atrocities in Bucha, the town outside Kyiv that was occupied during the early weeks of Russia's full-scale invasion. He was convicted later that year on charges of spreading false information about the Russian military. He noted, proudly, that the video over which he was jailed had racked up 2m views.\n\nThe exchange last week included the US citizens Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, but most of the 16 people freed from Russian jails were Russian political prisoners.\n\nYashin surprised many when he appeared at a press conference the day after the exchange, looking irritated and upset to be there, and calling his inclusion a \"forced deportation\". He pointed out that he had always said he did not want to be swapped, insisting there were other prisoners in poor health more deserving of a spot, and certain that a Russian politician should be in Russia, whatever the circumstances.\n\n\"A voice heard from inside Russia, even from in prison, especially from in prison, is much more convincing than a voice from outside,\" he said at the press conference.\n\nA week later, the emotions have calmed but sentiment remains. Nevertheless, the possibility to see his parents, who flew in from Moscow earlier this week, and to enjoy small freedoms such as sitting in a cafe and ordering a coffee, or choosing what time to go to bed, is undeniably exhilarating.\n\n\"I have very contradictory emotions, they're exploding my head from within. It would be stupid to deny that I'm happy to be able to walk freely in the street, breathe fresh air, to open and close doors when I want to,\" he said.\n\nHe does not yet know where he will live or what his future life will look like. But he said he planned to keep doing what he was doing before, even if he now had to do it from exile.\n\n\"People don't believe there was a massacre in Bucha and it is all a fake,\" he said. \"Well, we have to explain that this was real, that it's something we should feel ashamed of because it was our co-citizens who did it.\"\n\nHe said that while in prison, he had read books about the denazification of Germany and felt that there could be some lessons for the Russia of the future. \"Germans were taken on excursions to death camps, to show that it wasn't some kind of propaganda but it really happened. That's what we'll have to show people too,\" he said.\n\nYashin said that during his two years of imprisonment, he met about 30 men who were planning to take advantage of Russia's offer to prisoners to be released in order to go and fight in Ukraine, and he had attempted to talk them out of it.\n\n\"My statistics aren't great.

He admitted he was still somewhat disoriented, a week after the exchange that unexpectedly gave him his freedom. Two weeks ago, he was in a Russian prison cell two years into an eight-and-a-half-year sentence and he still makes regular doubletakes, struck anew by the sudden, dramatic transition.\n\n\"I hope that next week I will be able to find an apartment, move out of the hotel and unpack some of the things my mum brought me from Moscow. I need to orient myself, remember how to eat breakfast, work out where to go for a walk, how to use public transport. Everything is new, I need time to adapt,\" he said.\n\nYashin, now 41, was arrested in 2022 over comments he made in one of his regular video streams, in which he discussed Russian atrocities in Bucha, the town outside Kyiv that was occupied during the early weeks of Russia's full-scale invasion. He was convicted later that year on charges of spreading false information about the Russian military. He noted, proudly, that the video over which he was jailed had racked up 2m views.\n\nThe exchange last week included the US citizens Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, but most of the 16 people freed from Russian jails were Russian political prisoners.\n\nYashin surprised many when he appeared at a press conference the day after the exchange, looking irritated and upset to be there, and calling his inclusion a \"forced deportation\". He pointed out that he had always said he did not want to be swapped, insisting there were other prisoners in poor health more deserving of a spot, and certain that a Russian politician should be in Russia, whatever the circumstances.\n\n\"A voice heard from inside Russia, even from in prison, especially from in prison, is much more convincing than a voice from outside,\" he said at the press conference.\n\nA week later, the emotions have calmed but sentiment remains. Nevertheless, the possibility to see his parents, who flew in from Moscow earlier this week, and to enjoy small freedoms such as sitting in a cafe and ordering a coffee, or choosing what time to go to bed, is undeniably exhilarating.\n\n\"I have very contradictory emotions, they're exploding my head from within. It would be stupid to deny that I'm happy to be able to walk freely in the street, breathe fresh air, to open and close doors when I want to,\" he said.\n\nHe does not yet know where he will live or what his future life will look like. But he said he planned to keep doing what he was doing before, even if he now had to do it from exile.\n\n\"People don't believe there was a massacre in Bucha and it is all a fake,\" he said. \"Well, we have to explain that this was real, that it's something we should feel ashamed of because it was our co-citizens who did it.\"\n\nHe said that while in prison, he had read books about the denazification of Germany and felt that there could be some lessons for the Russia of the future. \"Germans were taken on excursions to death camps, to show that it wasn't some kind of propaganda but it really happened. That's what we'll have to show people too,\" he said.\n\nYashin said that during his two years of imprisonment, he met about 30 men who were planning to take advantage of Russia's offer to prisoners to be released in order to go and fight in Ukraine, and he had attempted to talk them out of it.\n\n\"My statistics aren't great. From 30 I managed to persuade three not to go. It's not much, but it's also not nothing. It's three people who stayed alive, three people who didn't kill anyone in Ukraine, three soldiers fewer in Putin's occupation army,\" he said.\n\nSoon after his release, Yashin called for a ceasefire in the conflict, angering some in Ukraine who believe such a move would only play into Putin's hands.

In fact, he had said at one point that he would never accept such a deal -- and reiterated it last week, describing his release as a \"forced deportation.\"\n\nUnlike many Kremlin critics, Yashin had long refused to leave Russia despite mounting pressure from the authorities, arguing that his voice would sound weaker from abroad. He stayed even after the invasion in 2022 and hastily adopted laws criminalizing any public criticism of it.\n\nHe told AP that his newfound freedom has left him feeling conflicted.\n\nOn one hand, there's \"a massive surge of enthusiasm, massive inspiration and a lot of joy,\" Yashin said.\n\n\"For the first time in over two years ... I don't need to wake up at 5 a.m. after being ordered to wake up, I don't need to walk with my hands behind my back, there are no bars, fences, and barbed wire around, I can breathe in fresh air, eat what I want, call whoever and whenever I want,\" Yashin said. \"This feeling of freedom, it's inebriating.\"\n\nOn the other hand, when he thinks about scores of other people still languishing in prisons and jails in Russia, \"it feels like I'm getting hit in the head with a hammer.\"\n\nWorking to swap more of them is now part of Yashin's focus. There are so many more worthy of freedom than himself, the dissident believes, especially those whose emotional and physical health is rapidly deteriorating behind bars.\n\nHe also wants to stay in touch with Russian emigres abroad and advocate for them with Western officials, as well as put forward projects that Kremlin foes could unite around.\n\nBut Yashin sees his main mandate as reaching as many people inside Russia as he can -- and not just those who oppose the war, but those who support it, too.\n\n\"We need to talk to them, and we need to pull these people out of the shackles of Putin's propaganda,\" Yashin told the Berlin rally on Wednesday. \"We need to explain that this monstrous war against Ukraine ... is a war against Russia too, because this war is crippling ... entire generations. It is taking away the future of our country.\"\n\nHe has faced criticism for urging a cease-fire in one of his first interviews after release, but says it will not deter him.\n\n\"I feel responsibility for what is happening and want to prove ... to Russians that this war is harmful for Russia, that it a tragedy for both Ukraine and Russia,\" Yashin said.\n\nGetting through to those who support the Kremlin \"will be an important step to stop the aggression,\" he said.\n\nYashin intends to use his YouTube channel, which has nearly 1.7 million followers, but admits it could be difficult because Russian authorities reportedly are slowing down the platform that is a vital conduit there for critical voices at a time when most independent media and Western social platforms have been blocked.\n\nHe said at some point, he will need to take a pause to sort out his life in Germany, assemble a team, and find time to rest and recuperate after prison.\n\nOver two years behind bars took a toll on his physical and mental state, Yashin admitted. He has noticed, for example, that he slouches more often after many nights on an uncomfortable cot in solitary confinement. Although there are other health issues he must address, he says he is \"fine\" overall.\n\nHe said he got a big emotional boost from Wednesday's rally, that drew hundreds of his supporters.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Yashin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lev Yashin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissident", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dissident"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucha,_Kyiv_Oblast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bucha, Kyiv Oblast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political prisoner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_the_Crimean_Tatars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deportation of the Crimean Tatars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbed_wire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbed wire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solitary confinement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/pf/resources/images/logo-bg.jpg?d=492", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805405", "eventUri": "eng-9805405", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1210, "textEnd": 1216}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Now that he is free, he wants to continue his work.\n\n\"I can only say one thing: the Russian opposition should engage in anti-war education,\" Yashin said.\n\n\"When Western politicians ask me how they can support the Russian opposition, I say: save Ukraine from Putin and continue to support Ukraine. Because if you save Ukraine, you will help a free Russia\".\n\nThe 41-year-old highlighted that ending the war in Ukraine is as important to him as promoting democracy in Russia, saying that he wished the Russian flag to be \"freed from blood and dirt\".\n\nYashin was a close friend and ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin's biggest opponent, Alexei Navalny who died in a Siberian prison in February. His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, has publicly blamed Putin for Navalny's death however Moscow has publicly insisted that Navalny died of natural causes.\n\nSupporters at the event suggested that Yashin could become Russia's next prominent opposition figure after the death of Navalny.\n\n\"Alexei's personality, his manner and all his charisma are unique, I think,\" said one of Yashin's supporters at the event.\n\n\"I think Ilya definitely has potential, energy and a political stance that will allow him to become a cool, prominent and very important Russian politician in the future. I am very excited about Ilya's plans,\" she said.\n\nDespite promoting anti-war education, Yashin said he did not yet know exactly how he would organise his political activity outside Russia.\n\nIn a press conference organised by German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, Yashin said he would be \"prepared to work with all organisations that are involved in anti-war work\".\n\nYashin regularly communicates with his followers via his YouTube channel. With over 1.6 million followers, he has a wide reach both inside and outside Russia.\n\nIn prison, he used this channel to try and educate Russian citizens about the Kremlin's war crimes, among other things. As he was unable to film himself in his prison cell he used a cartoon-like figure against the backdrop of a prison wall to communicate his messages.\n\nOne of Yashin's followers said that he regularly watched his YouTube channel and could identify with many of his ideas.\n\n\"Yashin is one of the politicians I like. I mean, I've watched his videos, I've listened to his interviews and I agree with the ideas he puts forward. Of course, there are also moments when I think differently\".\n\nYashin received over 30,000 letters during his imprisonment. The 41-year-old said that they had given him courage and helped him through the difficult times in prison, allowing him to mentally escape from being behind bars.\n\nThe released opposition activist rallied those listening to communicate with friends and relatives still in Russia, \"even if it is difficult\" as this was one of the few ways to change mindsets on Putin and the war in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Yashin, the war in Ukraine is no longer just a battle between two states. It is a battle between good and evil, a battle of freedom against tyranny. \"Our strength lies in our convictions and our morals,\" said Yashin.\n\nYashin was one of a total of 26 prisoners who were exchanged between Western countries and Russia in a landmark prison exchange case.\n\nAmong those who returned to Russia was Vadim Krassikov, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany in December 2021 for the murder of the Georgian of Chechen origin Selimchan Khangoshvili, \"Tornike\".\n\nWithin Germany the release of Krassikov sparked controversy from those who questioned whether a convicted murderer should be released.\n\n\"I understand the difficult ethical dilemma in which Chancellor Scholz's government found itself. I sincerely appreciate the decision they made,\" said Yashin.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_Vladimir_Putin_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to Vladimir Putin in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Yashin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lev Yashin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Navalny", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Navalny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Yashin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Yashin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Freedom_Party_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People's Freedom Party (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Navalnaya", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yulia Navalnaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Welle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siberia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chechens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/63/94/64/1200x675_cmsv2_a3d2a0e0-4605-5c84-9f3b-d765d5d647e0-8639464.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805405", "eventUri": "eng-9805405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

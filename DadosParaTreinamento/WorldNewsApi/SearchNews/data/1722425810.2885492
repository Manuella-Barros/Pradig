The City of Gosnells plans to industrialise 257 hectares of land which includes parts of the Greater Brixton Street Wetlands in Kenwick \u2014 home to 11 threatened ecological communities and over 600 native plant species. The Save the Greater Brixton Wetlands group met with Gosnells Mayor Terresa Lynes on Friday morning to call on the council to withdraw its plans but were unsuccessful. The rezoning is part of a larger industrial area precinct under construction in the area. 'Absolute disaster' in the making Speaking with the ABC after the meeting, campaign manager Paddy Cullen described the outcome as \"very disappointing\". \"This will be an absolute disaster that goes against all scientific advice,\" he said. \"This will fragment the area, it will lead to pollution of the water, it will disrupt the water, meaning it will dry out the wetland and will threaten the animals and plants here, some [which are] found nowhere else in the world.\" Plan goes against EPA advice The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) recommended against the rezoning due to the complex hydrology of the area. The EPA said the plan was \"not likely to be consistent with its objectives for inland waters, flora and vegetation and terrestrial fauna.\" In that report, EPA chair Professor Matthew Tonts described the wetlands as \"internationally significant\". But the EPA also gave authorities an out \u2014 in the event they were to proceed anyway \u2014 by suggesting ways in which the plan could go ahead without having such an impact on the environment. Mr Cullen said the Gosnells mayor indicated in the meeting the EPA advice would be challenged. Wetlands 'jewel in the crown' University of Western Australia Emeritus Professor Hans Lambers, who is also involved in the wetlands conservation group, said plant species would be threatened if the industrial plans proceed. \"It's imperative that we look after this area,\" he said. \"It's unique not just in Australia, it's unique on a world scale \u2014 this is the jewel in the crown of the biodiversity hotspot.\" The group previously rallied against the city in 2018 with a development that wiped out sections of the wetlands but were unsuccessful. \"This issue has not stopped with this meeting,\" Mr Cullen said. \"We will continue to go back to council meetings and ask questions, we will go to ministers and ask them to intervene, and we will go to federal ministers.\" The group is advocating for the wetlands to instead be turned into a regional park linking Canning River with the Kalamunda hills. City 'acutely aware' of wetlands' importance Gosnells Mayor Terresa Lynes released a statement saying the city was acutely aware of the importance of protecting the wetlands, which were viewed as the \"jewel in the crown\" of the area's natural environment. Ms Lynes said the state government had zoned the land surrounding the wetlands for industry and the city was just trying to bring its local scheme into alignment \u2014 which was a legal requirement. She said rezoning the land would enable effective planning control to be put in place, and this would include significant buffers to protect the wetlands. Ms Lynes also said 95 per cent of the land identified for rezoning was degraded and held little to no environmental value, something she believed was overlooked b the EPA. She said under the city's plan, 57 hectares would be rehabilitated to high-quality bushland.

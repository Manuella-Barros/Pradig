Army spokesman sets conditions for dialogue: apology, constructive politics, and end to anarchy. Any dialogue must hold perpetrators accountable for attacking army and symbols. PTI spokesperson challenges Army's accusations, demands independent inquiry. PTI claims increasing \"venom\" and attempts to target the party.\n\nA top Pakistan Army general on Tuesday said that any dialogue with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party could happen only if it ''earnestly apologises'' in front of the nation, promises to adopt ''constructive'' politics and forgoes ''politics of anarchy''.\n\nMaj-Gen Ahmed Sharif, the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) - the media wing of the Pakistan military - made the remarks in a press conference in Rawalpindi just two days before the first anniversary of May 9 violence.\n\nOn May 9 last year, violent protests erupted after the arrest of Khan by paramilitary Rangers from the premises of the Islamabad High Court. His party workers vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander house), Mianwali airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad. The Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi was also attacked by the mob for the first time.\n\nMaj Gen Sharif rejected the rumours about talks with Khan's party, saying that no talks would be held with a group that \"attacks the army and malign it\".\n\nAny dialogue with Khan's party could happen only if it ''earnestly apologises in front of the nation, promises to adopt constructive politics and forgoes politics of anarchy,'' the army spokesman said.\n\nWhen asked about May 9, he said: \"Firstly, May 9 is not just the Pakistan Army's case but the entire country's.\n\n''If, in any country, an attack is launched on its army, symbols of its martyrs are insulted, its founder's house is set on fire, hatred is created between its army and public, and if the people behind it are not brought to justice, then there is a question mark on that country's justice system.\n\n''We believe that if we have to maintain trust in the justice system of Pakistan, then May 9 perpetrators -- both the perpetrators and those commanding them -- must be sentenced according to the Constitution and the law.'' Hours later, Khan's party hit back at the army spokesman, saying he showed \"a mind full of contradictions because at the end of it all I could not understand anything\".\n\n''We challenge them on all the things he said to bring evidence for it before the nation and the easiest way for that ... is to institute an independent transparent judicial inquiry,\" PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan told the media in Islamabad.\n\nHasan said that the army spokesman wanted a commission to start the probe from 2014 sit-in by the PTI but it should also be tasked to the cipher case, the PTI government's ouster, the attempted assassination on Imran Khan, audio leaks and the alleged rigging in the February 8 elections.\n\nThe PTI spokesman said that he could not understand \"why there is such frustration and what are the factors that propel them again and again to give such statements, which have no rationale or logic?\" Hasan claimed that multiple attempts were made to target PTI and the passage of time, there was an increase in the \"intensity and venom\" against the party.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

His party workers vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander house), Mianwali airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad. The Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi was also attacked by the mob for the first time.\n\nMaj Gen Sharif rejected the rumours about talks with Khan's party, saying that no talks would be held with a group that \"attacks the army and malign it\".\n\nAlso Read | China Stabbing: Two Killed, 21 Injured in Knife Attack at Zhenxiong County Hospital in Yunnan Province.\n\nAny dialogue with Khan's party could happen only if it \"earnestly apologises in front of the nation, promises to adopt constructive politics and forgoes politics of anarchy,\" the army spokesman said.\n\nWhen asked about May 9, he said: \"Firstly, May 9 is not just the Pakistan Army's case but the entire country's.\n\n\"If, in any country, an attack is launched on its army, symbols of its martyrs are insulted, its founder's house is set on fire, hatred is created between its army and public, and if the people behind it are not brought to justice, then there is a question mark on that country's justice system.\n\n\"We believe that if we have to maintain trust in the justice system of Pakistan, then May 9 perpetrators -- both the perpetrators and those commanding them -- must be sentenced according to the Constitution and the law.\"\n\nHours later, Khan's party hit back at the army spokesman, saying he showed \"a mind full of contradictions because at the end of it all I could not understand anything\".\n\n\"We challenge them on all the things he said to bring evidence for it before the nation and the easiest way for that ... is to institute an independent transparent judicial inquiry,\" PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan told the media in Islamabad.\n\nHasan said that the army spokesman wanted a commission to start the probe from 2014 sit-in by the PTI but it should also be tasked to the cipher case, the PTI government's ouster, the attempted assassination on Imran Khan, audio leaks and the alleged rigging in the February 8 elections.\n\nThe PTI spokesman said that he could not understand \"why there is such frustration and what are the factors that propel them again and again to give such statements, which have no rationale or logic?\"\n\nHasan claimed that multiple attempts were made to target PTI and the passage of time, there was an increase in the \"intensity and venom\" against the party.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Military installations and martyrs monuments came under attack during these protests, which formed the basis of a severe state crackdown on the party and its leadership.\n\nAt a press conference on the eve of the first anniversary of the May 9 incident, DG ISPR Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharif said that there was no doubt that the PTI was behind the May 9 riots.\n\nHowever, he said that yet some people were demanding the judicial commission to probe the events of May 9. He said the army was ready for the formation of a judicial commission but added that such an inquiry should also cover the 2014 sit-in and other related events.\n\nHe denied the 'narrative' that May 9 was a 'false flag operation'.\n\nDuring the press talk, a documentary film about May 9 was shown, in which attacks on military installations can be seen. The documentary also showed the statements of PTI leaders Murad Saeed, Shandana Gulzar and Shehryar Afridi.\n\nMaj-Gen Ahmed Sharif said that a political party provoked the youth but now \"confusion\" was being created by demanding a judicial commission.\n\n\"We are ready... make a judicial commission. The judicial commission should also cover what the 2014 sit-in was and what its objectives were. It should also cover how the Parliament was attacked. How people were given the courage to stand against the state.\"\n\nHe said that the capital was attacked using the resources of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in 2016, adding that Islamabad was attacked again in 2022.\n\nThe army spokesperson was questioned about statements made by the PTI and the former prime minister, who claimed that their triumph on February 8 \"rejected the narrative of May 9.\"\n\nIn response, Major General Ahmed Sharif said that the turnout on February 8 was 47 per cent. \"Of this particular political party that says the narrative has been reversed, this party got 31 per cent of the vote. 92% of the population does not stand with them. We believe that the people are standing with the army.\"\n\nHe further said that some political circles on social media frequently make accusations against the army and institutions. \"In response to these allegations, instead of providing evidence, more allegations are made.\"\n\nHe urged for legislative action on this matter, emphasising that failure to act would destabilise the very fabric of society.\n\nThe army spokesperson said that letters were written to the IMF, lobbying was done not to give loan to Pakistan, and letting the country default. \"If those who were behind May 9 are not punished, then no one's life, wealth, honour and dignity will be safe.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, the DG ISPR was asked by a journalist that the alleged masterminds of May 9 had not been punished despite the passage of a year.\n\nThe spokesperson underscored that May 9 was not solely a concern for Pakistani forces but rather a matter concerning the entire populace of Pakistan.\n\n\"If one believes in Pakistan's justice system and its framework of accountability, then according to the Constitution, those responsible for the events of May 9, including both perpetrators and masterminds, must face legal repercussions.\"\n\nOn \"creating a narrative\" on May 9, the spokesperson of the army added that May 9 is not a hidden thing. \"The irrefutable evidence of this is also with the public.\"\n\n\"We all saw it happen with our own eyes. We have all seen how people were brainwashed. They were brainwashed by lies and propaganda against the army, its leadership and agencies.\"\n\n\"Political leaders selected targets. They attacked military installations across the country in a few hours.\"\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of any deal, the spokesperson reiterated that the army has no political role. \"The army is apolitical and its relationship with every government is in accordance with the Constitution and law,\" he added.\n\n\"All political parties are respectable for us. However, if any political group attacks its own army, no one will interact with them. The only way for such an anarchist group is to apologise to the nation and promise to leave the politics of hatred and engage in constructive politics,\" he stressed.\n\nRegarding the allegations made by six Islamabad High Court judges against the intelligence agencies, the DG ISPR stated that the issue was currently under judicial review. \"It is not fair to make accusations without proof. There is no benefit in taking the army into political affairs.\"\n\nWhen questioned about the accusation of \"regime change\" concerning Saudi Arabia, the army spokesperson expressed regret, stating, \"You cannot damage relations with friendly countries in the name of expression. This is absolutely wrong.\"\n\nWhen questioned about whether the army has handed over military bases in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to the US or any similar arrangement is underway, the spokesperson responded unequivocally, stating, \"Neither base has been nor will be handed over to anyone in Pakistan.\"\n\n\"This is ridiculous. This is propaganda.\"\n\nWhen questioned about Corps Commander Mangala, General (retd) Ayman Safdar's premature retirement due to alleged political affiliations, the army spokesperson emphasised the army's stringent, transparent, and ongoing self-accountability process.\n\nHe highlighted that any violation of rules and regulations, including corruption, triggers the accountability system, which operates without discrimination. Notably, he emphasised that the accountability process is even more rigorous for senior ranks.\n\nHowever, the spokesperson refrained from disclosing specific charges against former corps commander Mangala or whether he was dismissed.\n\nWhen queried about the progress of the inquiry launched against former DG ISI General (retd) Faiz Hameed regarding a housing society case, the DG ISPR outlined the accountability process in place.\n\nHe stated that a two-star general is overseeing the inquiry in accordance with directives from the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Defence.\n\n\"Its purpose is to look into the allegations and ascertain facts. Based on this, recommendations will be prepared.\"\n\nTalking about the clash between police and army personnel in Bahawalnagar, the spokesman said, \"Police and security officials resolved it amicably.\"\n\nHe said that anti-national elements want to create a rift. The incident was unfortunate, it was resolved amicably and an inquiry was underway.\n\nHe remarked that individuals who criticise the subsidiaries of the Pakistan Army would like to live in DHA, get treatment in CMH, and send their children to these universities and colleges. He said that the role of the army in SIFC and the economy was to facilitate.\n\nOn Afghanistan, the spokesperson said that despite repeated demands and sharing of evidence, the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) continued to operate from Afghanistan. \"Pakistan shared credible evidence, but no action was taken. The linkage of the recent terrorist incidents can be found in Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"Pakistan has helped the Afghan interim government at all levels, but the promises they made in Doha do not seem to be fulfilled. The agreement clearly states that Afghanistan's territory will not be used against any country, but there is strong evidence that this is happening. In this regard, the Foreign Office recorded repeated protests with the Taliban government.\"\n\nThe DG ISPR stated that in recent months, there have been attempts by terrorists to disrupt the peace situation in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nHe said those who carried out the terrorist attack against the Chinese engineers came from Afghanistan. \"The terrorists and their facilitators were being controlled from Afghanistan while the suicide bomber was also an Afghan citizen.\"", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "pakistantoday.com.pk"}, "authors":

His party workers vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander house), Mianwali airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad. The Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi was also attacked by the mob for the first time. Maj Gen Sharif rejected the rumours about talks with Khan's party, saying that no talks would be held with a group that \"attacks the army and malign it\".\n\nAny dialogue with Khan's party could happen only if it \"earnestly apologises in front of the nation, promises to adopt constructive politics and forgoes politics of anarchy,\" the army spokesman said. When asked about May 9, he said: \"Firstly, May 9 is not just the Pakistan Army's case but the entire country's. \"If, in any country, an attack is launched on its army, symbols of its martyrs are insulted, its founder's house is set on fire, hatred is created between its army and public, and if the people behind it are not brought to justice, then there is a question mark on that country's justice system. \"We believe that if we have to maintain trust in the justice system of Pakistan, then May 9 perpetrators \" both the perpetrators and those commanding them \" must be sentenced according to the Constitution and the law.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHours later, Khan's party hit back at the army spokesman, saying he showed \"a mind full of contradictions because at the end of it all I could not understand anything\". \"We challenge them on all the things he said to bring evidence for it before the nation and the easiest way for that \" is to institute an independent transparent judicial inquiry,\" PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan told the media in Islamabad. Hasan said that the army spokesman wanted a commission to start the probe from 2014 sit-in by the PTI but it should also be tasked to the cipher case, the PTI government's ouster, the attempted assassination on Imran Khan, audio leaks and the alleged rigging in the February 8 elections. The PTI spokesman said that he could not understand \"why there is such frustration and what are the factors that propel them again and again to give such statements, which have no rationale or logic?\" Hasan claimed that multiple attempts were made to target PTI and the passage of time, there was an increase in the \"intensity and venom\" against the party.", "source": {"uri":

What threat can there be to something that isn't even present?\n\nThe party spokesperson claimed that several attempts had been made to target the PTI. However, as time passes and their frustration increases, the intensity and venom targeting PTI has increased, he added.\n\nHasan said he usually avoids documents devoid of substance or meaning, but the press conference he heard contained the kind of venom that is not appropriate for the state, society and relations with institutions.\n\nThe PTI spokesperson said that there is a one-person diktat and dictatorship based on which the country is being run and it will collapse soon, it cannot last for long.\n\nAddressing the points raised by the DG ISPR, Hasan said: We are challenging them on everything he has said to bring proof before the nation and the easiest way to do this is to institute an independent and transparent judicial inquiry to determine the culprits and planners of the events of May 9.\n\nThey say they are ready to create such a judicial commission, but the judicial commission will talk about the 2014 sit-in, it will also talk about the attack on Parliament, etc. and we agree, he however said, adding that the commission should also probe the encryption case, ouster of PTI government, assassination attempt on Imran, audio leaks and alleged rigging during the February 8 elections.\n\nThese are all things that we have demanded and if DG ISPR wants to form a judicial commission with two of its conditions, then we will support them because there is no other way to know who committed the crimes and why and who supported them, he said. said, stating that the PTI was not involved in the events.\n\nHasan said the commission should be independent and not subordinate to the military.\n\nThe PTI spokesperson also questioned the DG ISPR's distortion by saying that only seven percent people voted for the party.\n\nAccording to Gallup, independent candidates affiliated with the PTI received 31.2% of the votes in the general elections.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com",

Following the attacks on its installations including its martyrs' memorials, the military declared May 9 as a 'Black Day', describing it as a \"dark chapter\" of the country's history.\n\nAddressing the media following a meeting with the former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, Barrister Gohar reiterated his party's demand to constitute a judicial commission to probe May 9 events.\n\nHowever, in an unprecedented rebuttal to the military spokesperson's press conference, the PTI spokesperson separately held a press conference to respond to allegations levelled by the military's spokesperson.\n\n\"DG ISPR's presser a pack of lies, full of contradictions, venomous, devoid of logic,\" Raoof responded, saying a judicial commission should be tasked to probe, what PTI says was a false-flag operation, to bring the orchestrators, perpetrators and facilitators of May 9 to justice. He felt that the ISPR's press conference would harm the relations between the state and the people.\n\nThe PTI spokesperson said that \"the May 9 false flag operation was a well-planned conspiracy aimed at dismantling PTI\" but added that it was rejected by the public on February 8, 2024, general elections.\n\nDuring the press conference, Raoof questioned the factors that propelled DG ISPR to address \"such an irrational, illogical and venomous press conference to target the country's biggest political force.\"\n\nResponding to DG ISPR's statement that there was no threat to democracy, Raoof said that the military spokesperson was right when he said that there was no threat to democracy as it doesn't exist right now in the country, asking how can something be in danger if it doesn't even exist.\n\nHe added there was a dictatorship in the country right now.\n\nAlso read: Imran was aware of cipher's sensitivity, FIA tells IHC\n\nThe party spokesperson claimed that multiple attempts were made to target PTI. \"However, as time passes and their frustration increases, there has been an increase in the intensity and venom targeting the PTI,\" he added. Raoof stated that DG ISPR eventually showed willingness that a judicial commission be constituted to probe the May 9 incidents but attached certain conditions.\n\nRaoof asserted that the judicial commission must be constituted as PTI had been demanding for the last year \"but not subservient to the military\" so that the nation could know the truth whether PTI is responsible for the tragic May 9 incident or those who are accusing PTI.\n\nHe went on to say that PTI openly challenged DG ISPR's assertions and they should present all the shreds of evidence related to May 9 and PTI would present its proof in this regard before the judicial commission to establish how and why the May 9 incidents occurred.\n\nRaoof stated that the judicial commission should investigate the 2014 sit-in but PTI demands that the commission should also extend its scope to hold a transparent probe into May 9 incidents, regime change conspiracy, stolen mandate through blatant poll rigging on February 8, assassination attempt on PTI Founding Chairman Imran Khan, the cypher conspiracy, audio/video leaks, enforced disappearances and the political engineering in the country to dismantle PTI.\n\nPTI CIS emphasized that the judicial commission should be constituted now to bring the actual culprits of the May 9 incidents before the nation so that no one could hold a press conference against PTI every two months.\n\nRaoof said that DG ISPR claimed that all the visuals of the May 9 incidents were captured by the eye of the camera, but questioned where all the CCTV footage relating to Imran Khan's arrest and corps commander's house and others, saying they disappeared seemingly to cover the crime.\n\nAbout DG ISPR's attempt to distort facts regarding election results that PTI has only 7% of the popular vote, Raoof stated: \"There is a limit to lies,\" adding that PTI is the country's largest political party, having representation in every province of the country with over 170 national assembly seats.\n\nPTI CIS stated that political parties fraudulently imposed on the nation would not be able to gather 2,000 people but if PTI was allowed it would gather over 200,000 people within no time. \"Let's see if the public is with them or with the person who has been unjustly imprisoned in Adiala for a year,\" he added.\n\nRaoof also refuted the allegation that PTI was a 'terrorist group', saying a political party doesn't become a terrorist group and people wouldn't believe it if a person says so. He said that it was not PTI but those who hijacked the election, blocked Twitter and unleashed a reign of terror for the past two years were responsible for spreading chaos and anarchy in the country.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, PTI lawyer Intazar Panjutha, who met Imran Khan in jail on Tuesday, said that the former premier has seconded the proposal to investigate May 9 events but has also put forward three demands: on whose order he was arrested from Islamabad High Court (IHC); who stole CCTV footages of IHC; and who ordered police not to register FIRs of murders of PTI workers in the wake of May 9 saga.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Public Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "False flag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Pakistani_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1970 Pakistani general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Jail_Rawalpindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Jail Rawalpindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Investigation_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Investigation Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Independent States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/PTI-Chairman-Barrister-Gohar-Ali-Khan1703156390-0/PTI-Chairman-Barrister-Gohar-Ali-Khan1703156390-0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547087", "eventUri": "eng-9547087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 148, "textEnd": 153, "freq": 17}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-08", "textStart": 4508, "textEnd": 4518}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

He said the army was ready for the formation of a judicial commission but added that such an inquiry should also cover the 2014 sit-in and other related events.\n\nHe denied the 'narrative' that May 9 was a 'false flag operation'.\n\nDuring the press talk, a documentary film about May 9 was shown, in which attacks on military installations can be seen. The documentary also showed the statements of PTI leaders Murad Saeed, Shandana Gulzar and Shehryar Afridi.\n\nMaj-Gen Ahmed Sharif said that a political party provoked the youth but now \"confusion\" was being created by demanding a judicial commission.\n\n\"We are ready... make a judicial commission. The judicial commission should also cover what the 2014 sit-in was and what its objectives were. It should also cover how the Parliament was attacked. How people were given the courage to stand against the state.\"\n\nHe said that the capital was attacked using the resources of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in 2016, adding that Islamabad was attacked again in 2022.\n\nRead more: PTI calls for judicial commission to probe May 9 events\n\nThe army spokesperson was questioned about statements made by the PTI and the former prime minister, who claimed that their triumph on February 8 \"rejected the narrative of May 9.\"\n\nIn response, Major General Ahmed Sharif said that the turnout on February 8 was 47 per cent. \"Of this particular political party that says the narrative has been reversed, this party got 31 per cent of the vote. 92% of the population does not stand with them. We believe that the people are standing with the army.\"\n\nHe further said that some political circles on social media frequently make accusations against the army and institutions. \"In response to these allegations, instead of providing evidence, more allegations are made.\"\n\nHe urged for legislative action on this matter, emphasising that failure to act would destabilise the very fabric of society.\n\nAlso read: Terrorism to end if Kabul shuts TTP havens: Asif\n\nThe army spokesperson said that letters were written to the IMF, lobbying was done not to give loan to Pakistan, and letting the country default. \"If those who were behind May 9 are not punished, then no one's life, wealth, honour and dignity will be safe.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, the DG ISPR was asked by a journalist that the alleged masterminds of May 9 had not been punished despite the passage of a year.\n\nThe spokesperson underscored that May 9 was not solely a concern for Pakistani forces but rather a matter concerning the entire populace of Pakistan.\n\n\"If one believes in Pakistan's justice system and its framework of accountability, then according to the Constitution, those responsible for the events of May 9, including both perpetrators and masterminds, must face legal repercussions.\"\n\nOn \"creating a narrative\" on May 9, the spokesperson of the army added that May 9 is not a hidden thing. \"The irrefutable evidence of this is also with the public.\"\n\n\"We all saw it happen with our own eyes. We have all seen how people were brainwashed. They were brainwashed by lies and propaganda against the army, its leadership and agencies.\"\n\n\"Political leaders selected targets. They attacked military installations across the country in a few hours.\"\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of any deal, the spokesperson reiterated that the army has no political role. \"The army is apolitical and its relationship with every government is in accordance with the Constitution and law,\" he added.\n\n\"All political parties are respectable for us. However, if any political group attacks its own army, no one will interact with them. The only way for such an anarchist group is to apologise to the nation and promise to leave the politics of hatred and engage in constructive politics,\" he stressed.\n\nRegarding the allegations made by six Islamabad High Court judges against the intelligence agencies, the DG ISPR stated that the issue was currently under judicial review. \"It is not fair to make accusations without proof. There is no benefit in taking the army into political affairs.\"\n\nAlso read: Imran was aware of cipher's sensitivity, FIA tells IHC\n\nWhen questioned about the accusation of \"regime change\" concerning Saudi Arabia, the army spokesperson expressed regret, stating, \"You cannot damage relations with friendly countries in the name of expression. This is absolutely wrong.\"\n\nWhen questioned about whether the army has handed over military bases in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to the US or any similar arrangement is underway, the spokesperson responded unequivocally, stating, \"Neither base has been nor will be handed over to anyone in Pakistan.\"\n\n\"This is ridiculous. This is propaganda.\"\n\nWhen questioned about Corps Commander Mangala, General (retd) Ayman Safdar's premature retirement due to alleged political affiliations, the army spokesperson emphasised the army's stringent, transparent, and ongoing self-accountability process.\n\nHe highlighted that any violation of rules and regulations, including corruption, triggers the accountability system, which operates without discrimination. Notably, he emphasised that the accountability process is even more rigorous for senior ranks.\n\nHowever, the spokesperson refrained from disclosing specific charges against former corps commander Mangala or whether he was dismissed.\n\nWhen queried about the progress of the inquiry launched against former DG ISI General (retd) Faiz Hameed regarding a housing society case, the DG ISPR outlined the accountability process in place.\n\nHe stated that a two-star general is overseeing the inquiry in accordance with directives from the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Defence.\n\n\"Its purpose is to look into the allegations and ascertain facts. Based on this, recommendations will be prepared.\"\n\nTalking about the clash between police and army personnel in Bahawalnagar, the spokesman said, \"Police and security officials resolved it amicably.\"\n\nHe said that anti-national elements want to create a rift. The incident was unfortunate, it was resolved amicably and an inquiry was underway.\n\nHe remarked that individuals who criticise the subsidiaries of the Pakistan Army would like to live in DHA, get treatment in CMH, and send their children to these universities and colleges. He said that the role of the army in SIFC and the economy was to facilitate.\n\nOn Afghanistan, the spokesperson said that despite repeated demands and sharing of evidence, the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) continued to operate from Afghanistan. \"Pakistan shared credible evidence, but no action was taken. The linkage of the recent terrorist incidents can be found in Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"Pakistan has helped the Afghan interim government at all levels, but the promises they made in Doha do not seem to be fulfilled. The agreement clearly states that Afghanistan's territory will not be used against any country, but there is strong evidence that this is happening. In this regard, the Foreign Office recorded repeated protests with the Taliban government.\"\n\nThe DG ISPR stated that in recent months, there have been attempts by terrorists to disrupt the peace situation in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nHe said those who carried out the terrorist attack against the Chinese engineers came from Afghanistan. \"The terrorists and their facilitators were being controlled from Afghanistan while the suicide bomber was also an Afghan citizen.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [],

Initially about terrorism in the country, the press talk very quickly turned to the May 9, 2023 riots whose anniversary looms tomorrow. The ISPR DG has said that the perpetrators and facilitators of the May 9 riots need to be sentenced as per law and constitution so that the justice system's credibility is preserved. On the demand for the constitution of a judicial commission to probe the May 9 riots, the presser said that the army has no objection to such an investigation and that a judicial commission should not just probe the riots in depth but also look into the objectives of the PTI's 2014 dharna, how parliament and PTV were attacked at the time, and how Islamabad was stormed by using Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's resources. The ISPR DG also said it needs to be explored how lobbying firms were hired abroad, how letters were written to the IMF and the funding for these 'activities'. An independent judicial commission should probe all of this and it should also be made public so that people know who was behind the 2014 dharna and those involved in destabilizing a democratically elected government should also be taken to task. The same must be done for May 9.\n\nOn May 9 and the events of the day last year, there are also questions over why these trials cannot be conducted in open courts instead of opting for military trials. May 9 was indeed a very alarming incident and the perpetrators must be brought to justice. That said, we also need to ensure that all the evidence is made public so that the law can take its course. Observers also say that the PTI should also accept its workers were involved in the riots and attacks on military installations and let the law take its course instead of outright denial.\n\nThe DG of the ISPR also made it clear that there will be no talks with any political leader or group that was involved in attacks against its own army and which indulges in propaganda and that \"the only way forward for the anarchists is to apologise sincerely [for their acts], abandon the politics of hate and indulge in constructive politics [instead]\". This is something many political observers have pointed out before: that the PTI founder-chairman Imran Khan's insistence that May 9 was a 'false flag' operation is contrary to what the military establishment believes and thus without any acknowledgement of responsibility and apology for what transpired last year on that day, the differences between the establishment and PTI will not be resolved. From the tone and tenor of yesterday's press conference, it is quite clear that there is no room - at least for now - for forgiveness for May 9. This is contrary to how in recent weeks, PTI leaders have been making statements that they will only talk to the establishment and not to the PML-N, PPP and MQM. As the ISPR DG rightly pointed out, a political dialogue is for political parties, and not institutions. This is an important point because politics and political negotiations should be left with political parties and no institution has any business meddling in politics. That the PTI has so far stuck to its narrative and created a perception that February 8 elections results somehow negated what happened on May 9 was also countered by the DG ISPR. Observers had pointed out after the elections that the people exercised their right to vote because they want a political solution and not a bloody revolution on the streets. The PTI needs to realize that politics of confrontation cannot be sustained forever and only a political dialogue will lead to a political solution and an end to this chaos.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Public Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sit-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaudhry_Ahmed_Sharif_Gujjar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chaudhry Ahmed Sharif Gujjar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Television_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Television Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court-martial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Court-martial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muttahida_Qaumi_Movement_\u2013_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muttahida Qaumi Movement \u2013 Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Muslim League (N)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "False flag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Purchasing power parity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anarchism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-05-08/l_1186517_013453_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547087", "eventUri": "eng-9547087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 501, "textEnd": 506, "freq": 8}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-08", "textStart": 3437, "textEnd": 3447}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

It also showed clips of the violent mob attacking GHQ, the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore and other installations while Sheharyar Afridi was heard saying that InshaAllah, they would move towards GHQ. \"You can see as to how innocent youth was incited against their armed forces,\" the DG ISPR said.\n\nThe DG ISPR said that a judicial commission is sought if there is any confusion about a happening. \"But in this case, everything is crystal clear about those behind May 9 violence,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he stressed that if a judicial commission is to be formed then this whole incident must be probed in depth.\n\n\"The [judicial] commission should also look into what were the objectives of 2014 sit-in [...] how the parliament and the PTV [building] was attacked.\n\n\"And how Islamabad was stormed by using Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's resources in 2022,\" the DG ISPR said.\n\n\"The forum should also look into how lobbying firms were hired abroad, how letters were written to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and from where the funding was coming from and where it was being channelled to,\" the military's spokesperson added.\n\nSuch a commission, the DG said, should also see how letters were written to the IMF and other forums against dealing with the government of Pakistan to push it into an economic default situation. The commission should also trace where such elements were receiving funding.\n\nHe said that the issue of missing persons is very complicated, added the names of some terrorists killed in encounters were also included in the list of disappeared people. He said the cases of 7,940 out of 10,218 missing persons have been resolved according to the data of the inquiry commission.\n\n\"How does it happen that names of those who illegally migrated to other countries and are working with TTP in Afghanistan have been added to the list. The name of BLA terrorist Habibullah killed in an encounter also made to the list,\" he said.\n\nThe DG ISPR said that even in Western countries the number of missing persons goes into the tens of thousands but in Pakistan, propaganda is built by political forces, NGOs, media and social media activists.\n\nTo a question about the closure of 'X\" formerly Twitter, he said a false narrative is built regarding armed forces. \" The freedom of expression under Article 19 does not allow creating and building false narratives,\" Major General Ahmad Sharif Chaudhry said. He said that nobody could be allowed to put a country's existence and the dignity of an institution at stake in the name of freedom of expression.\n\n\"We feel that the executive and judiciary will ensure strict implementation of the already existing and upcoming laws concerning false propaganda on social media,\" he said. Asked whether 'X\" will be reopened, the military spokesman said it was not the proper forum to take such decisions.\n\nTo a question about the February 8 election outcome, he said out of 65 million voters, only 18 million voted for a specific party which was 31pc of all votes in total. He said that there were 69pc voters who did not accept their narrative. Referring to one of the independent surveys, he said that 70 percent of people said they were standing by with the armed forces.\n\nMajor General Ahmad Sharif said that the Pakistan Army has always remained non-political and only has a constitutional relationship with every government. To a question about allegations of massive rigging against the Pakistan Army in the election, he said that the Army's role in general elections was confined to only the mandate given by the Election Commission of Pakistan, which is to provide a secure environment for smooth conduct of polls. \"We did not play any role more than providing safe environment for the conduct of general elections,\" he said.\n\nHe said those levelling such allegations, should come up with solid evidence before concerned institutions. \"We talk based on facts and not on mere fake narrative and false allegations,\" he said, adding Pakistan's democracy is facing threats only from such undemocratic behaviours.\n\nTo a question about the dismissal or forced retirement of ex-Corps Commander Mangla Ayman Bilal Safdar, the DG ISPR said that the Pakistan Army follows a very strict and transparent system of self-accountability which comes into action against indiscipline or corruption. The DG ISPR said that self-accountability gets harder when it comes to a senior officer because they are supposed to be more responsible. \"Our accountability system works on the basis of facts and not merely on allegations,\" he said.\n\nTalking about contributions to the total tax collections, Maj Gen Ahmed Sharif said that only the Pakistan Army contributed Rs100 billion and sub-ordinates organisations like Fauji Foundation and Defence Housing Authority paid Rs260 billion as direct taxes and duties during the fiscal year 2022-23.\n\nTo another question, he said the Pakistan Army in SIFC was playing the role of facilitator and coordinator and helping out technically and professionally concerned institutions and organizations. \" This is not happening the first time in Pakistan. The past governments have also been utilizing services of Pakistan Army economic and general well-being of people,\" he said.\n\nResponding to a question about allegations of six judges of Islamabad High Court against intelligence agencies, he said the matter is sub judice in the Supreme Court. To another question regarding handing over military bases to another country, the DG ISPR termed the notion as ridiculous and strongly rebutted any such development. He also pledged that the military leadership would never do this in future as well. To a question about the involvement of an ex-DG ISI in the affairs of a housing society, the military spokesman said that following directives by the Supreme Court, a two-member was conducting an inquiry which would give its recommendations.\n\nMajor General Ahmed Sharif said that the Pakistan Army is committed to dismantling terrorist groups disclosing that the plot to kill Chinese engineers in Besham was hatched in neighboring Afghanistan. He said the suicide bomber was an Afghan national and the vehicle used in the attack was also prepared in that country saying that other key culprits have been arrested by the law enforcement agencies. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said security forces conducted 13,135 Intelligence Based Operations (IBOs) against terrorists and their facilitators starting from January this year. During these operations, 249 terrorists were killed 396 were apprehended and two officers and 60 soldiers embraced Shahadat.\n\nThe DG ISPR reiterated that Pakistan had always helped Afghanistan and reminded the interim government in Kabul that one of its pledges made to Pakistan was not to let the Afghan soil be used for any terror acts against the latter. Maj Gen Ahmed said despite all the efforts by Pakistan and pointing it out to the Afghan interim government, the TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan) terrorists are continuously committing acts of terrorism in Pakistan. Pakistan, he said, had provided concrete evidence but no action was taken from the Afghan authorities. The DG ISPR said that there was credible evidence that the TTP terrorists were still using Afghan soil to launch attacks on Pakistan. In that regard, he mentioned, the Foreign Office had registered 12 protests.\n\nThe army chief had taken a clear stance that Pakistan had strong reservations about the hideouts of banned outfits in Afghanistan. \"We will make the Pak-Afghan border a normal border with documented movement,\" he said. He said that everyone knows that Pakistan tried its best to ensure peace in the region, especially in Afghanistan. However, the repatriation of illegal Afghan nationals is now in the larger interest of Pakistan.\n\nThe DG ISPR said that there are 29,000 Chinese nationals in Pakistan of these, 2500 are engaged with CPEC-related projects. Maj Gen Ahmed Sharif said ensuring the security of all Chinese nationals is government's top priority and all possible steps are being taken in this regard. The DG ISPR said the attack on Chinese engineers was aimed at sabotaging the Pakistan-China friendship and hurting the CPEC project.\n\nRegarding Pakistan's relations with Saudi Arabia, Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said Saudi Arabia is taking a keen interest in helping Pakistan's economy and it is unfortunate that some political elements do not hesitate to harm Islamabad's relations with friendly countries. \"We have special defence, security and friendly relations which are reflected in visits of Prime Minister and Army Chief,\" he said.\n\nHe said that the prime minister and foreign minister had time and again expressed thanks to Saudi Arabia for investing in Pakistan boosting the country's economy. About a fake narrative by leaders of a political party of Saudi Arabia's involvement in regime change, he said it was highly regrettable and reflected a condemnable political thought. \" This thought does not want to see Pakistan economically prosper and such elements can go to any extent to damage relations with friendly countries,\" he said.\n\nReferring to the situation on the eastern border, the DG ISPR said Pakistan's civil and military leadership is fully cognizant of the planning being made in India to divert attention from its internal difficulties. Alluding to the Indian ceasefire violations, the DG ISPR said the Pakistan Army has responded in a befitting manner and it will continue to do so in future. There have many ceasefire violations including 59 technical violations, 16 air space and 120 other violations.\n\nHe said Pakistan stands by their Kashmiri brothers and sisters and will continue to extend political, diplomatic and moral support to them for their right to self-determination. He said India is also involved in extra-territorial killings of Sikhs. He said there is also evidence of the involvement of India in the assassination of people inside Pakistan.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"},

He condemned the violence and is willing to face an inquiry into a 2014 protest. Khan's refusal came after the military demanded an apology from those involved in the May 9 riots as a condition for dialogue. Khan insists he is not seeking a deal or fleeing the country. The riots, led by Khan's party supporters, saw military installations vandalized after his arrest in a corruption case.\n\nPakistan's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan has refused to apologise for the unprecedented May 9 riots, a day after the military ruled out dialogue with his party unless they tendered a public apology over the unprecedented violence.\n\nKhan, who spoke to the media after the court proceedings in the 190 million pounds Al Qadir corruption case at Adiala jail on Wednesday, also said that he was ready to face an inquiry into the sit-in that his Pakistan Tehreek-Insaf party staged in 2014, Dawn newspaper reported.\n\nWhen asked whether he would apologise for the May 9 violent protest, 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician replied no, saying he was under detention at the time and was unaware of those protests, the report added.\n\n\"I condemned the May 9 incidents in front of (former) chief justice Umar Ata Bandial,\" he added.\n\nThe ex-premier mentioned that he became aware of the protests when he appeared before the then-chief justice of Pakistan, Umar Ata Bandial.\n\nKhan has been incarcerated since August last year after he was booked in several cases ranging from corruption to violating the Official Secrets Act.\n\nThe PTI founder was responding to a question related to Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Tuesday's press conference wherein he demanded ''those involved in the May 9 violent protests to apologise'' and shun politics of \"anarchy\" before holding any dialogue.\n\nThe chief military spokesperson had also ruled out any dialogue with those who attacked military installations.\n\nHe had also said that the May 9 accused and perpetrators would have to be punished as per the Constitution and law.\n\nReferring to the DG ISPR statement linking dialogue with the apology, the ousted premier said: \"If you don't want to talk, then don't, I am asking for holding dialogues for the sake of Pakistan.\" Khan said neither he was interested in striking any \"deal\" nor wanted to go abroad and flee the country.\n\nThe mayhem on May 9 last year was led by supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party who were triggered into action by the arrest of their leader in a case of alleged corruption.\n\nKhan's party workers vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali Airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad after the cricketer-turned-politician was arrested in a corruption case.\n\nThe Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi was also attacked by the mob for the first time.\n\nFollowing the May 9 violence last year, Khan and hundreds of his party colleagues are being tried under multiple cases, including one under the stringent Official Secrets Act in connection with the violent protests.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

Imran further said if the establishment is not interested in dialogue, his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) will also not pursue it, reported Dawn.\n\nImran Khan, who spoke to the media after the court proceedings in the 190 million-pound Al Qadir corruption case at Adiala jail on Wednesday, also said that he was ready to face an inquiry into the sit-in that his Pakistan Tehreek-Insaf party staged in 2014. The 71-year-old cricketer-turned-politician declined to apologise for the May 9 riots, saying he was under detention at the time and was unaware of those protests.\n\n\"I condemned the May 9 incidents in front of (former) chief justice Umar Ata Bandial,\" he said, adding that he wanted dialogue with the military for the sake of Pakistan, not a deal for personal favours. The coalition government and the military establishment of Pakistan on Thursday condemned the May 9 riots on its first anniversary and the former dedicated the day to martyrs.\n\nOn May 9, the supporters of Imran Khan's party vandalised over 20 military installations and government buildings, including the Lahore Corps Commander House, Mianwali airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad. The violent protests came in the wake of Imran's arrest by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on corruption charges. He was later released on bail. Police arrested over 10,000 workers of PTI and hundreds are being tried, including one under the Official Secrets Act. At least 10 people were killed.\n\nImran was booked in multiple cases related to the violence on May 9, but he has the allegations mentioned in the first information reports (FIRs) of the cases. The former PM was charged with plotting and incitement to violence and was even named in two terrorism cases. The riots are believed to have led to a military-backed crackdown on the PTI, which was barred from contesting the general election directly. The Shehbaz Sharif-led government decided to commemorate the day in solidarity with martyrs and their families with the slogan: \"May 9, never again.\"\n\nSoon after the riots, civil and military leaders last year decided to observe May 9 as \"black day\" at the national level. Meanwhile, the PTI has planned to organise gatherings across the country to express solidarity with its incarcerated leader, whose brief arrest had triggered the violence. PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan claimed that there was a crackdown on PTI supporters across the country, with dozens arrested in different cities to scuttle their planned protest.\n\nPM Shehbaz said there \"can absolutely be no soft-pedalling of what happened on May 9\" last year and \"there can be no absolution for those who orchestrated, supported, and assisted the attempt to damage the foundations of our nation\". The premier said on X that \"not only were symbols of our national pride and honour attacked but the sanctity of our sacred homeland was also assaulted\" on that day.\n\n\"On the one hand, there are the great sons of the nation who shed their blood for their homeland, their great families, and the patriotic public. On the other, there are those characters burning in the fire of hatred, who neither have any pain in their heart for state interests nor have any respect or nobility for national monuments, state institutions, the Constitution or the law,\" he said in another post..\n\nMeanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari said in a statement that May 9 will always be remembered as a dark day in Pakistan's history when a \"politically instigated mob ran amok\", damaging public property and military installations. He affirmed that any attempt to misuse these rights to incite violence would never be tolerated.\n\nPakistan Army's media affairs wing highlighted that bringing the \"real culprits of May 9 [riots] to justice\" was paramount to ensure no future desecration of the memories of the country's heroes. \"Bringing the real culprits of May 9 to justice is paramount to ensure that in future, no one dares to desecrate the memories of our heroes and the symbols of our unity through such unwarranted conduct in future,\" the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.", "source": {"uri":

The military has also initiated army court trials of at least 103 people accused of involvement in the violence. Many close Khan aides have since deserted him, due to what is widely believed to be pressure from the army, which denies interfering in politics.\n\nKhan and the PTI say the May riots have been used as a ruse by political rivals and the military to crack down on the party, which is arguably the most popular in Pakistan. Khan has also been indicted under Pakistan's anti-terrorism law in connection with the violence. A section of Pakistan's 1997 anti-terrorism act prescribes the death penalty as maximum punishment. Khan has denied the charges under the anti-terrorism law, saying he was in detention when the violence took place.\n\nThe crackdown on the PTI has continued well after May 9, and the party has complained that it was not allowed to campaign freely in Feb. 8 general elections as many of its candidates were arrested, their candidatures refused by the election commission and the PTI party itself stripped of its iconic bat symbol, forcing hundreds of its members to contest using different symbols. Khan himself was ruled out of the election after a slew of convictions and jail sentences.\n\nOn Thursday, the PTI said it would be organizing \"peaceful\" gatherings across the country to express solidarity with Khan, who has been in jail since August last year and convicted in four separate cases.\n\nThe PTI says the May 9 protests were a \"natural reaction\" to Khan's arrest and has distanced itself from the violence that broke out on that day.\n\nOmar Ayub Khan, leader of opposition in the National Assembly and a close Khan aide, said on Wednesday night police in Pakistan's most populous Punjab province were raiding the homes of PTI leaders and supporters to scuttle public events planned for the May 9 anniversary.\n\n\"Condemn the Punjab Police crackdown against PTI parliamentarians and activists all across Punjab last night,\" Omar said on X. \"9th May 2023 was a 'False Flag Operation' against PM Imran Khan and PTI.\"\n\n\"Regardless of the crackdown, peaceful rallies and protests will be held across Pakistan in the morning,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

SCREENGRAB\n\nFormer prime minister and incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, Imran Khan, has said that he is ready for any inquiry into his party's 2014 sit-in, a day after the chief military spokesperson hinted at a judicial probe into the event.\n\n\"I will be happy if I am presented before the inquiry committee. All the allegations leveled against me regarding the 2014 sit-in are false... the 2013 election was the election of ROs,\" he remarked while interacting informally with the media at Adiala Jail on Wednesday.\n\nThe army on Tuesday sought a sincere and public apology from Khan and asked him to shun what it called \"politics of anarchy and hate\" to revive his political fortunes. However, at the same time, it dismissed the possibility of any 'deal' with the PTI founder, saying there won't be any talks with \"anarchists.\"\n\nAt a press conference, DG Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Ahmed Sharif said that there was no doubt that the PTI was behind the May 9 riots. However, he said that yet some people were demanding the judicial commission to probe the events of May 9. He said the army was ready for the formation of a judicial commission but added that such an inquiry should also cover the 2014 sit-in and other related events.\n\nThe DG ISPR denied the 'narrative' that May 9 was a 'false flag operation'.\n\nRead more: Army wants Imran to apologise, shun politics of 'anarchy'\n\nIn today's media interaction, Imran Khan also questioned the feasibility of negotiations with the federal government in light of former caretaker prime minister Anwarul Haq Kakar's reference to Form-47.\n\nKakar, while having a heated exchange with PML-N leader Hanif Abbasi over wheat scandal, had reportedly hinted at dropping a bombshell regarding Form-47, insinuating that it \"would leave the PML-N red-faced\".\n\nKakar hinted at possible tampering in Form-47 while speaking to Abbasi, a veiled reference to allegations also made by the opposition PTI, whose candidates allege rigging in the Feb 8 general elections.\n\nHowever, Kakar later clarified that his remarks were taken out of context in the media, stating that he merely corrected Abbasi's erroneous statements regarding the caretaker government's handling of the wheat procurement.\n\nDuring the media interaction, Khan further alleged that PML-N members had suggested no elections would occur and Nawaz Sharif would not return to the country until Justice Qazi Faiz Isa became the chief justice.\n\nHe criticised the electoral processes, asserting that elections for president, prime minister, Punjab chief minister, and Senate were fraudulent. He claimed that private conversations with PML-N members revealed their belief that elections and Sharif's return hinged on Justice Qazi Faiz Isa's appointment as chief justice.\n\nKhan said that half of his family is in the army and half in the bureaucracy. \"The army belongs to us, and we have no conflicts with it,\" he remarked a day after the military's top spokesperson came down hard on Khan and his party over the May 9 mayhem.\n\n\"I only came to know about the events of May 9 when I was presented in the Supreme Court... I condemned the events of May 9 in front of then chief justice Umar Atta Bandial,\" he said.\n\n\"For God's sake, don't drag army into politics... we have never indulged in agitation in our 27-year history... we dissolved two governments [in Punjab and at Centre] for elections because our political party does not want chaos,\" said the incarcerated leader.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sit-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kakar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Jail_Rawalpindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Jail Rawalpindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Public Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Muslim League (N)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nawaz Sharif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "False flag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anarchism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanif_Abbasi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanif Abbasi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, Pakistan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/imrankhanmarch22screen1679491174-0/imrankhanmarch22screen1679491174-0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547087", "eventUri": "eng-9547087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1135, "textEnd": 1140, "freq": 6}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-08", "textStart": 2156, "textEnd": 2161}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

PTI supporters refer Gen to psychiatrist - ExBulletin", "body": "New Delhi: A press conference by General Ahmed Sharif, Director General of Pakistan's Inter-Services Public Relations, has not gone down well with the people of the country, including PTI supporters who are now suggesting he consult a psychiatrist and a psychologist. The sharp reactions came after the ISPR director general demanded the party apologize for targeting military installations on May 9 last year.\n\nThe Pakistan Army is now facing backlash on social media and citizens have turned the press conference into a meme event.\n\nThe only apologies pending for about seven decades now are those owed by the military-industrial-political complex to a population that never fully achieved the constitutional right to self-representation and grew up under massive repression, persecution and limited freedoms, wrote one user of Today's press are hilarious, ridiculous and ridiculous.\n\nView full article\n\nMany choose not to be as respectful. The memes arrived with users Photoshopping Sharif onto everything from Bollywood dance numbers to spiritual gatherings.\n\nA user put his photo in the viral video of followers of a monk who went berserk after getting his blessing.\n\nAnother dug his father's Wikipedia page, which talked about conspiracy theories involving djinns and energy crises.\n\nAnother user posted a photo of Sharif climbing out of a gutter while another posted a photo of him running away from a crowd charging at him with shoes. He was called an \"idiot\" with a joker's face.\n\nWhat the general says\n\nIt all started when General Ahmed Sharif laid down some ground rules for dialogue with Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party and demanded an apology from the PTI for the events that took place on May 9 last year. He also insisted that the party abandon what he calls \"the politics of anarchy.\"\n\nThere can be no dialogue with any anarchist group, he said, adding that the only way forward for anarchists is to sincerely apologize, abandon the politics of hatred and engage in constructive policy. [instead]the talks are about political parties, not institutions, Sharifs said.\n\nHe also added that nothing is hidden regarding the date May 9. The public, the military, and all of us have compelling evidence that certain political leaders have ordered their supporters to selectively target military installations.\n\nSharif's press conference quickly became the ground for a battle between the Pakistani military and Imran Khan's supporters, with the latter calling for the trial of military officials under Article 6 for alleged interference in politics.\n\nAt an official press conference addressing the generals' comment, PTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan said the conference reflected a spirit full of contradictions because in the end I didn't understand anything.\n\nPTI social media manager Jibran Ilyas said that General Sharif had unknowingly become the 12th man of PTI.\n\nI must say that social media is on fire today!#DGISPRne Maryam Nawaz ko completely beats Kardiya, when it comes to rejuvenating the insafians. Shukriya#12thMan, he tweeted.\n\nAsad Qaiser, senior PTI leader, responded to Sharif's call for apology by saying: \"Allah forgives me but I will never ask for forgiveness, even from my father.\" The army must remain within its constitutional limits.\n\nAmid the PTI's cheers and criticism of the military, voices have emerged questioning the military's involvement in political affairs and emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability.\n\nFor starters, why is a military spokesperson commenting on political voting trends, extrapolating mixed results (consistent with common journalistic consensus) and using them to deepen the civilian-military divide that exists due to this very absurdity? to see uniforms in politics? wrote one social media user.\n\nIndependent journalist Kiyya Baloch added: Call it a tragedy or misery of this society, a serving army officer appears at a press conference and asks a politician and a political group to seek an apology for nothing. In fact, the army and generals must apologize for their interference in politics.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Public Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anarchism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wikipedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asad_Qaiser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asad Qaiser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Nawaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryam Nawaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freelancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloch_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baloch people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-72-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547087", "eventUri": "eng-9547087", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 394, "textEnd": 399, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The army has made it crystal clear that it is no mood to forgive Imran's temerity in challenging the country's most powerful institution, and trying to impose on it his own choices for the key institution like the ISI, that led to Imran vilifying the army brass, and his followers attacking army headquarters in Lahore on May 9, 2023.\n\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, the director general of the army's public relations wing has said PTI has tender a public apology before a dialogue could be started between the army and the party, which it helped to install in power six years ago, a brazen act of interference in politics that earned Imran the dubious title of \"selected\", rather than elected, prime minister.\n\nInter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharif on Tuesday said that any dialogue with the PTI could happen only if it \"earnestly apologises publicly in front of the nation\", promises to adopt \"constructive politics\" and forgoes \"politics of anarchy\".\n\n\"There is only one way back for such political anarchists that it (PTI) asks for an earnest apology in front of the nation and promises that it will forgo politics of hate and adopt constructive politics,\" the DG ISPR said.\n\nHe hurried to add: \"In any case, such dialogue should take place between political parties. It is not appropriate for the army to be involved.\"\n\nIt is clear now that the Pakistani army is in no mood to forgive Imran and his party, particularly after the May 9, 2023 events, when mobs went on rampage in Lahore and ransacked the Corps Commander's residence, following the arrest of Imran from the premises of the Supreme Court, where he was convicted for three years in a case of fraud involving a trust set up by his wife, Bushra Bibi.\n\nImran, who was picked by the army, which helped him to build his party as a counterweight to PML-N, whose leadership had shown signs of going against the generals, was dumped after he grew too big for his boots and fancied himself as superior to his benefactor, the force in Khaki.\n\nImran's charge against the army that it attempted to assassinate him and that it collaborated with the US to oust his party from power was too much to swallow for the army, which had been angered by his refusal to accept the Chief of Staff's appointment of a new chief for the ISI, the super espionage agency of Pakistan controlled by the army. Imran was for the continuation of his acolyte Faiz Hameed. Gen Bajwa, then COAS, recommended the name of Nadeem Anjum. The army won that round, but was furious with Imran.\n\nBut Imran's interference in army appointments, although as PM, his word was final, was viewed by the army as a revolt, considering that it always had its way with elected prime ministers. The generals decided Imran had to go and engineered an exodus from Imran's party, including his close associates. That led to Imran being ousted after he lost the confidence vote.\n\nSince then, more than a hundred cases have been filed against Imran, and he was barred from contesting the elections to the polls for the National Assembly on February 8, 2024, which was rigged by the army and the election commission to ensure that PTI loses, and the new favour of the month, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a coalition of opposition parties led by PML-N and PPP, wins. The PDM won what was clearly a farcical election and currently rules Pakistan.\n\nMeanwhile, Imran has been in Adiala jail for a year now, and the PTI has been virtually emasculated. He faces, according to his lawyers, more than 150 case. Some of the cases include Imran keeping for himself gifts received by the leaders of other countries, which should have gone into the government treasury, and a challenge to the sanctity of Imran's marriage with Bushra, as prosecution says she was not duly divorced when Imran married her, which could earn both jail terms. In sum, Imran faces cases, which if jail terms, already awarded, and likely to be awarded are to be served cumulatively, Imran will be in jail for life.\n\nThe PTI has a new president, Gohar Khan, and he is trying to rally the faithful, but with Imran in jail and facing cases that will keep him busy for years, and the Pakistan army showing no signs of forgiveness, the former cricketer and his party, though immensely popular with people, will remain out of the pale of mainstream politics, till the Khakis decide otherwise.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

to mark the anniversary of the events of violence that took place last year on the same date.\n\nViolent protests and riots broke out across the country, especially in the garrison town, with charged mobs vandalising private and public properties including military installations following Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023.\n\nFollowing the violent protests, the military had declared May 9 as \"Black Day\".\n\nThe Rawalpindi district administration on Wednesday announced the observance of \"Black Day\" on Thursday with an official notification.\n\nAs per the notification, different ceremonies will be organised for students and teachers in all educational institutes to highlight the importance of observance \"Black Day\".\n\nNo one will be allowed to leave the assembly hall of the educational institutes during the ceremony and the principal of the institute will be responsible to maintain discipline in the meantime.\n\nOn Tuesday, Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Major General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that the perpetrators and facilitators of the May 9 riots need to be punished as per the Constitution and law of the land to preserve the credibility and faith in the country's justice system.\n\n\"The issue of May 9 riots is not limited to the Pakistan Army but [in fact] concerns the whole nation,\" the military's spokesperson said while addressing a press conference in Rawalpindi.\n\nNoting that the public was a witness to the May 9 incident the spokesperson lamented how some people were \"brainwashed\" against the armed forces and said: \"We saw how some political leaders gave selected targets [to the mob]\".\n\n\"We saw that only military installations were attacked within a span of few hours [and] you saw the public outrage when evidence for this came to limelight.\n\n\"The lies and deceit cannot continue [...] the people accused of being involved in May 9 riots need to be punished,\" said the chief military spokesperson.\n\nThe May 9 riots were triggered almost all over the country after the deposed prime minister was arrested from the premises of the Islamabad High Court in a corruption case.\n\nThe clashes and incidents of violence erupted countrywide as the alleged PTI supporters resorted to violence to protest the arrest of the party chief.\n\nDuring the protests, the miscreants targeted the civil and military installations including -- Jinnah House and the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi.\n\nHundreds of PTI workers and senior leaders were put behind bars for their alleged involvement in violence and attacks on military installations.\n\nSeveral party bigwigs and senior members parted ways with PTI and Khan in the light of crackdown against those involved in May 9 events.", "source": {"uri": "geo.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "GEO TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng":

He suggested that PTI could receive a clean chit if it sought forgiveness, condemned the 9th May inferno, vowed not to repeat such an episode and committed to playing a sincere role in the country's development and progress. He emphasized that the perpetrators of violence and destruction at Jinnah House were so evidently guilty that further evidence was unnecessary for their conviction. However, despite this, they have not received exemplary punishment. In contrast, the army, which operates under an automatic, transparent and stringent accountability system, has already subjected all those found complicit or failing in their duties during the 9th May episode to rigorous scrutiny. He specifically cited the case of Lt. General Bilal, Corp Commander Mangla, and former ISI chief General Faiz, who were subjected to strict disciplinary measures by the army due to their alleged involvement, which contravened army discipline and conduct.\n\nWhile criticizing the demand for formation of judicial commission on 9th May inferno, he said that commissions are formed to inquire into those incidents where there was an ambiguity and lack of clarity, whereas in this case the planners, instigators, perpetrators are all known, and there was no need for any inquiry. But if at all the inquiry commission had to be constituted then there should be commissions to hold inquiries against the Dharna of 2014, attack on the Parliament House, attack on PTV Headquarters and to the Prime Minister's House for unearthing the reasons, motives and conspiracy against the then sitting government.\n\nThe ISPR chief vehemently asserted that while the army respects all political parties and engages with them for the nation's progress and prosperity within the bounds of the law and constitution, it will not engage with those who have desecrated the resting places of the Shuhadas, incited young minds against the state and the army, attacked army installations, threatened the army, instigated supporters to attack army vehicles, or propagated campaigns to defame the army and drive a wedge between the people and the defence forces. However, he did not specify the constitutional or legal provisions perhaps due to paucity of time which empowered the army to liaise with political parties.\n\nWhile addressing the pervasive anti-state and anti-army sentiments on social media, he suggested that by slowing down the internet and suspending platforms like Twitter (now replaced by X), the pace and toxicity of propaganda have been significantly reduced. He indicated that not only existing laws and regulations would be rigorously enforced to bring offenders to justice, but also new legislation would be introduced by parliament to prosecute those engaging in malicious and toxic propaganda against the state, the army, the judiciary and those undermining friendly relations with foreign countries.\n\nHe refrained from commenting on the letters addressed by the six judges to the Supreme Judicial Council, complaining about blatant and overbearing interference by intelligence agencies, stating that the matter is sub judice. However, he added that any complaint had to be supported with incontrovertible facts and evidence; otherwise, such allegations should be regarded as part of a campaign against the army and its institutions.\n\nHe claimed that PTI is considered the most popular party, while data, evidence and surveys show that only 7.5% of the total population voted for PTI in the Feb-8 elections. Credible surveys reflected that 74% of the people of Pakistan consider the army as the top most credible and trusted institution of the country. He emphasized that the Feb-8 elections do not prove that those who voted for PTI endorsed or seconded the May-9 incident. Moreover, those who didn't vote for PTI did so against PTI's venomous and toxic politics.\n\nHe dismissed allegations against the army's involvement in alleged rigging in the Feb-2024 elections as part of a propaganda smear campaign against the army. He demanded evidence from those blaming the army for rigging and urged them to produce it before relevant institutions for adjudication or justice. He stressed that during the election, the army's role was confined to providing a secure enabling environment for fair, transparent and peaceful conduct, which was performed professionally, leading to peaceful elections nationwide.\n\nDefending the army's involvement in commercial, large-scale manufacturing, banks, mills, real estate business, construction and transportation, he argued that this phenomenon is not unique to Pakistan. He stated that in many other countries, the army pursues such endeavours to provide benefits to the families of Shuhuda, retired army personnel and their families. He clarified that not even a single penny of the exchequer was used in raising these institutions, though he couldn't elaborate on how these highly capital-intensive projects were funded due to time constraints.\n\nThe timing of the press conference was significant, given ongoing judicial proceedings. The Supreme Court is hearing the Faizabad Dharna case and has rejected the Dharna Commission's report. Another Supreme Court bench has suspended the Election Commission and Peshawar High Court's decision, which deprived PTI of special seats for women and minorities, impacting the coalition government's votes in parliament and its ability to make constitutional amendments. This ruling has also given hope to PTI for regaining their status as a political party elections symbol and securing the release of their leader. The entire judiciary is rising against interference by intelligence agencies and the executive in cases with significant political implications.\n\nThis press conference also posed a significant question: What happens if, following due judicial process, the Supreme Court clears the former chairman of PTI and its leaders, who have been imprisoned for a year, allowing PTI to resume functioning as a regular political party? How does this affect the army's demand that PTI must seek forgiveness to be spared?\n\n-- The writer is a former Press Secretary to the President.", "source": {"uri": "pakobserver.net", "dataType":

The world saw unprecedented scenes as party workers vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House, the Lahore Corps Commander house, the Mianwali air base, and the ISI building in Faisalabad.\n\nEven the Army headquarters in Rawalpindi were attacked for the first time. Declared a 'Black Day' by the military, it is only now, one year later that the army has agreed to form a judicial commission to look into what happened in 2023.\n\nSenior Political Analyst Zulqernain Tahir, while talking to News9 Plus Editor Sandeep Unnithan on the News9 Plus Show, says riots erupted on May 9, 2023, because of people's anger against the Pakistan Army.\n\n\"What happened on May 9 shows that the people of Pakistan said enough is enough. What you have been doing for the last 75 years, no more that should be the order of the day. Later, Imran Khan's PTI tried to distance itself because of its political needs, but people had that kind of anguish, that kind of anger that had come out on May 9,\" says Tahir.\n\nPathikrit Payne, a foreign affairs expert, says I Khan became more popular after the Pakistan Army arrested him.\n\n\"There is not a single Pakistani Prime Minister who has completed his term as Prime Minister. So it was inevitable that Imran Khan someday would be in the Pakistan army's bad books. Pakistan's army itself is divided. One part is pro-America, and the other part is deeply Talibanized. That kind of brutal crackdown was inevitable. The Pakistan army for a long time since 1947 had an aura of invincibility. That day that aura was broken. They had to do something to restore a sense of normalcy. They have been able to contain Imran and put him behind bars, but if you look at the election result, it is clear that his popularity has only increased,\" explains Payne.\n\n\"For any country where you have the stranglehold of the forces or a dictatorial regime, they have to ensure that their economic aspects are taken care of so that people's basics are met, then they will not revolt. Pakistan is a country that has a tremendous external debt problem, internal debt crisis, and huge inflation. Unless the Pakistan army can ensure that the economic aspect of it can be taken care of, this is only going to implode further, \" adds Payne.\n\n\"After the May 9th incident, the footprints of PTI are so visible, there is no point going for judicial commission. The Army would not like to take this issue to the court or to any independent body like the judicial commission to probe this matter. The army might do something if Imran tenders an apology and pledges to do the politics of reconciliation,\" says Tahir.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "muralidhara_sampangishetty@news9live.com", "name": "Muralidhara Sampangishetty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News9_Plus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "News9 Plus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Ali Jinnah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisalabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faisalabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Faisalabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mianwali", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mianwali"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mianwali"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawalpindi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rawalpindi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pakistan-Army.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547087", "eventUri": "eng-9547087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 892, "textEnd": 897, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

This time last year, we witnessed a chaotic turn of events when state symbols and military installations came under attack following the arrest of Imran Khan. Now, as the PTI plans their nationwide protests to mark the anniversary, the country must brace itself for potential unrest.\n\nISPR DG Major-General Ahmed Sharif has set a firm tone for the events that lie ahead, making it evident that dialogue with the PTI hinges on an earnest public apology. Certainly, this does reflect the state's desire for constructive politics over chaos and anarchy, but it has also made it clear that they will not watch idly as anarchy spreads. With a coalition of disaffected minor parties rallying behind the PTI for protests, it is safe to say both sides are set on a collision course.\n\nPTI's unwillingness to compromise falls right in line with their prior history of trying to destabilise the nation. Despite their attempts over the past year to paint a different picture, every piece of historical evidence - whether it be live TV, social media posts, statements by PTI leaders - in the lead up to the unrest, hinted at a violent agenda, one that sought to forcefully seize power over the nation. This narrative and tactical approach is not new for the party either. The 2014 siege of the parliamentary house in the capital was a testament to the lengths that the PTI is willing to go to gain control by force. The scenes of a PTI-commandeered truck ramming into the fence of the NA is still a reminder of the party's penchant for disorder. We ought to remember that this siege was also in response to elections that the party felt were rigged, despite international consensus that the results were fair and valid. Being ten years removed is the big difference here - Pakistan cannot afford the instability and economic damage from such an extended sit-in protest anymore.\n\nThere is a clear disconnect between PTI's rhetoric and the nation's priorities. The top priority is stability - we need parliamentary participation, not futile rebellious endeavours. As we navigate the politically charged days ahead, it will be crucial for all parties, especially PTI, to abandon their individual ambitions and qualms, and instead focus on the collective interests of the people they govern.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Public Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sit-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.nation.com.pk/assets/thenation_202006/images/no-image-large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547087", "eventUri": "eng-9547087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 15, "textEnd": 20}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

The anniversary has been officially marked by a meeting of the Federal Cabinet expressing solidarity with the armed forces, and by the PTI, not at all. However, two days before, the DG ISPR said that the Army could engage in talks with the PTI if it apologized for the May 9 outrages. This itself must be seen in the light of the reports that the PTI had appointed a three-man team to talk to the military. The very next day, the day before the anniversary, Mr Khan told reporters at Adiala Jail that he did not feel that he had to apologize for anything, and that if anything, he was owed the apology. He said that if the military did not want to negotiate, then there was no forcing them.\n\nMr Khan should realize that his kneejerk reaction reflects exactly the kind of obduracy that cost him the Prime Ministership. It reflects the kind of no-holds-barred take-no-prisoners kind of rhetoric that may go down well with the voter base, but which prevents the kind of dialogue that is the lifeblood of politics. His desperation to keep the military engaged, and thus involved in politics, reflects the kind of traditional politics that his supporters decry so much. His desire to involve the military, even though, as the COAS has said, it will keep to its constitutionally prescribed role, reflects a hankering after a past which should not be revived.\n\nThe PTI's appeal to the military is meant to satisfy its base, which believes it can only come back to power once it is back on the same page. Mr Khan's remarks are a tacit admission that the party is in a hole because of what happened in May 9 last year. There is a strong belief that Mr Khan was attempting a coup. Mr Khan should realise that that impression must be dispelled before the country can move on. If he is intrinsically unable to offer the requisite apology, he must prepare never to be forgiven, with all that means for him and his party.", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "pakistantoday.com.pk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Public_Relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Public Relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Jail_Rawalpindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Jail Rawalpindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army_Staff_(Pakistan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547087", "eventUri": "eng-9547087", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 577, "textEnd": 582, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

It added that 85 protesters were currently under military custody and being tried in military courts in a \"blatant violation of international human rights principles\".\n\nAmnesty said it was concerned about the prolonged detention of women protesters, including PTI's Sanam Javed, Yasmin Rashid and Alia Hamza, and the violation of their pre-trial rights through \"persistent denial of bail\".\n\n\"There has been a pattern of filing new cases and arrests after bail is granted in existing cases to keep protesters under custody. Families of those under civilian and military custody have been severely impacted, many losing their sole breadwinners and bearing the emotional brunt of their absence,\" Amnesty said.\n\nIt called on government to unconditionally release all peaceful protesters under detention and ensure the right to a fair trial was provided to those implicated in the protests as per its obligations under international human rights law.\n\n\"Immediately suspend trials of civilians through military courts,\" it further said and also called to end practices impeding the right to protest, including laws that penalised protesters and blanket bans on protests through imposition of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\nMeanwhile, the PTI issued a statement on X in a \"response to the false propaganda campaign of the state\".\n\nIt said it was standing firm on the basic demand of an independent, impartial and high-level judicial investigation on May 9's event, \"despite being subjected to brutal oppression, fascism and bullying for a year\".\n\n\"A lie could not be made true in one year,\" the party said.\n\nPTI spokesperson Raoof Hasan also said that the PTI was waiting for an impartial and independent enquiry to determine the factors of the events on May 9.\n\nHe said \"hundreds of people remained unjustly incarcerated causing indescribable suffering and pain\" to them and their families.\n\n\"This must end,\" Hasan said in a post on X.\n\nHe said Pakistan had incurred immeasurable damage because of such \"gory indulgences\" in the past and it was \"too weak to continue suffering these travesties:.\n\n\"The cruel strangulation of the state must end. Let it breathe. Let people breathe,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, party leader Malik Amir Dogar said that May 9 was a \"huge conspiracy and the darkest day in the country's history\".\n\nEarlier today, the party alleged that an attempt to arrest party leader Barrister Ali Gohar was made by the \"anti-terrorist squad\", adding that such \"disgusting, criminal and illegal\" acts were unnecessary.\n\n\"Such attempts are a direct assault on democracy,\" the party said in a post on X.\n\nPTI leader Hammad Azhar said that Pakistan had descended into a \"dark fascist abyss\".\n\nMeanwhile, voices from the PTI also called for a way forward. Barrister Gohar said while talking on Geo News programme 'Capital Talk' that \"this clash of titans must end, there should be a ceasefire and let's move forward.\"\n\nHe said the party's stance was that a \"window\" should always remain open.\n\nSeparately, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur also said while addressing a rally in Dera Ismail Khan: \"Let's announce a general amnesty. Let us move forward.\"\n\nHe said he was ready to apologise if the military spokesperson, referring to the press conference of the director general of the Inter Services Public Relations, could prove the party was to blame for the events of May 9.\n\n\"But if we can prove that someone else is the culprit then who would apologise to us? [...] You tell me,\" he said.\n\nCM Gandapur also warned that if the government tried to instate governor rule in the province, he would take over the Governor House using force.\n\n\"We will control the chief minister's house and the governor's house,\" he said.\n\nEarlier today, former president Arif Alvi said that the only route out of the current crisis was to come to the negotiating table.\n\n\"Imran Khan says if they want to talk, we'll talk,\" Alvi said while talking outside Adiala Jail, referring to the establishment.

Not only were symbols of our national pride and honor attacked, but the sanctity of our sacred homeland was also assaulted,\" Sharif said on X.\n\nHundreds of people were arrested when violence broke out on May 9, 2023 after Khan was briefly apprehended in a corruption case at the Islamabad High Court.\n\n\"There can absolutely be no soft-pedaling of what happened on May 9, and there can be no absolution for those who orchestrated, supported, and assisted the attempt to damage the foundations of our nation,\" Sharif added.\n\nThe country's military also issued a statement condemning the criminal acts committed on May 9, which it dubbed \"Black Day.\"\n\n\"On this one of the darkest days in our national history, politically motivated and brainwashed miscreants in an act of rebellion deliberately resorted to violence against state institutions and vandalized sacred symbols of the state and the sites belonging to national heritage,\" it said.\n\n\"The Pakistan Armed Forces thwarted the insidious conspiracy by the planners, facilitators and executors who wanted to destabilize Pakistan by inciting confrontation between the people and the Armed Forces,\" it added.\n\nThe PTI held protest rallies in various cities including Peshawar, Mardan, Swat, Dir, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Dera Ismail Khan and Faisalabad. Pro-army rallies were also held across the country denouncing the May 9 violence.\n\nThe party's biggest showing was held in Dera Ismail Khan district of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which was attended by thousands of party supporters.\n\nAddressing the rally, the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, who belongs to the PTI, demanded an \"amnesty\" for May 9 suspects to \"move forward.\"\n\nHe said the PTI's chairman is ready to apologize for the May 9 incidents if his party is found guilty in an \"impartial inquiry.\"\n\nAccording to the PTI, Islamabad and Rawalpindi police did not allow its workers to gather and to rally toward Adiala Jail, where Khan is imprisoned. Videos on social media showed police also arresting PTI interim Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan in Islamabad.\n\nSince May 9, the PTI has faced a crackdown, with thousands of its workers reported to be imprisoned and several key leaders leaving the party.\n\nSome of them faced military trials, and Khan is currently on trial in several cases.\n\nThe PTI denies involvement in attacks on public and private property and claims that the violence on May 9 was a conspiracy against the party.\n\n\"The false flag operation on May 9 which tried to crush the PTI was all pre-planned,\" Khan said in a message from jail.\n\n\"The nation should be told on whose order I was abducted from the Islamabad High Court by paramilitary armed forces on May 9 last year,\" he said in a statement posted on X.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pakistani military spokesman Maj. Gen. Ahmed Sharif demanded that Khan apologize for the violent riots on May 9 and distance his party from the protest.\n\nHowever, Khan on Wednesday rejected the demand for an apology, saying that it should be \"sought from them.\"\n\nOmar Ayub Khan, the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, called the military spokesman's press conference against the PTI an \"open interference in the

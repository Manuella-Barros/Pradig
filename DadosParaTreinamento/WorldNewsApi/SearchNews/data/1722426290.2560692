Finally, a Good Laugh There\u2019s nothing better than laughing so hard that you feel like you\u2019re screaming, you\u2019re running out of breath, and tears start falling. The best is when, after, you say out loud, \u201cI haven\u2019t laughed this hard in such a long time.\u201d And for that, I thank Martin Short. This week, Short resurfaced his iconic interviewer character, Jiminy Glick. I have to reiterate: I haven\u2019t laughed this hard in such a long time. Glick began as a recurring character on 1999\u2019s The Martin Short Show before gaining the spotlight in his own 2001 series, Primetime Glick. The gimmick is that Short-as-Glick, in a fat suit and prosthetics, was both boorish and utterly silly as he interviewed celebrities \u201cexpecting\u201d a normal junket interview. He\u2019d ask ludicrous questions, slyly insult them, and, often, chow down on a tower of donuts in the middle of conversations. This week, Short revived Glick in interviews with Bill Hader, Sean Hayes, and Melissa McCarthy. The shade on their careers were as hilarious as the random questions he\u2019d interject\u2014\u201cWere you for or against drones to take out the late Mickey Rooney?\u201d\u2014and otherwise left-turn statements: \u201cSo Willie Mays just died\u2026\u201d None of the celebs being interviewed could keep a straight face, and neither could I. What stuck out to me, though, is how perfect a counter-argument these segments are to those crotchety comedians who say \u201cyou can\u2019t be funny anymore\u201d because everything is too woke and people are too sensitive. This is a character who, truly, should be canceled; Jiminy Glick is very much a byproduct of the Y2K era where \u201cguy in a fatsuit\u201d constituted the funniest joke anyone could imagine. But here Short is as Glick, still in the fatsuit, delivering some of the edgiest lines any comedian has given in recent years, and earning the laughs because they have a point of view and a perspective on the cultural attitudes of the current moment. Case in point: a man, again, wearing a fatsuit, making gay jokes to Sean Hayes. But they are smart. They are evolved. They are still crude and ribald, but reflect evolved taste. Anyway, watch them for yourselves for a good time this weekend. Bill Hader, watch here. Sean Hayes, watch here. Melissa McCarthy, watch here. A Huge Return Sometimes, there is entertainment news that is absolutely seismic to a certain segment of people, while probably not registering to most of the population. The announcement that Jonathan Jackson is returning to the soap opera General Hospital to play Lucky Spencer is to many people\u2014including my mother, my Aunt Ruthie, and myself\u2014the equivalent of a 6.1 on the Richter scale. I grew up in a household where I knew who Luke, Laura, Sonny, and Carly were before I knew about John, Paul, George, and Ringo. General Hospital was foundational to my upbringing, and, if I\u2019m being honest, Jackson\u2019s Lucky was a start of my sexual awakening. (Kudos to him and Boy Meets World\u2019s Rider Strong.) This is such a fun update for the long-running show, and I apologize to my bosses in advance for being absent every day from 3-4 pm when his comeback starts. How Old Am I? I have vivid memories of David Archuleta performing on American Idol, and have read over the years about his journey coming out and how difficult it was because of his Mormon upbringing. Those Idol days seem like a million years ago, yet seeing the videos of him performing the Song of the Moment, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s \u201cEspresso,\u201d made me feel like it was just yesterday. Such a wild confluence of pop-culture time periods. (Also, the performance is great. Watch it here.) Huh? The world is such that, by this point, any random Mad Libs of names in a headline should be greeted with a shrug. Still, this one made me wonder if I had somehow woken up in the middle of a melatonin-induced fever dream and started reading the news. What in the world?

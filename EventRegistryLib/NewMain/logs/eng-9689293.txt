LOUIS (AP) -- Jonathan India had two hits to extend his hitting streak to nine games, Spencer Steer homered and the Cincinnati Reds beat the St. Louis Cardinals 11-4 on Thursday night.\n\nIndia had his sixth straight multi-hit game. He had reached safely in 11 consecutive at-bats before finally being retired Wednesday.\n\nReds starter Andrew Abbott (7-6) was the winner, allowing two runs on two hits and six walks in five innings. Cincinnati won for the second time in six games.\n\nMiles Mikolas (6-7) lasted 4 1/3 innings, allowing at least one run in each inning he pitched in. He gave up a career-high 10 runs, nine of them earned, on 12 hits and a walk.\n\nNoelvi Marte, in his first game back for the Reds after serving an 80-game suspension for banned substances, had three hits, scored three runs and drove in another.\n\nElly De La Cruz had three hits and stole his major league-leading 38th base. Steer, Will Benson and Stuart Fairchild also had multi-hit games as the Reds scored double-digit runs for the seventh time this season.\n\nDe La Cruz's triple scored India to give the Reds a 1-0 lead in the first inning and India's RBI double added to the lead in the second. It is the fifth straight game that India has doubled in, the longest by a Red since India's four-game run from Sept. 24-27, 2021.\n\nSteer, Nick Martini and Marte each doubled and scored in the third to make it 5-0 Reds.\n\nSteer's homer in the fourth made it 7-2 Reds and Benson and Fairchild each had an RBI double to extend the lead to 10-2 in the fifth.\n\nNolan Arenado hit a two-run homer in the third for St. Louis, his first since June 5. Brendan Donovan and Dylan Carlson added RBI doubles in the eighth, as the Cardinals lost for the second time in their last seven games.\n\nReds catcher Tyler Stephenson was a late scratch from the lineup and was replaced by Luke Maile. Stephenson left the game to be with his pregnant wife.\n\nTRANSACTIONS\n\nAside from reinstating Marte, the Reds optioned IF Livan Soto to Triple-A Louisville and moved RHP Emilio Pag\u00e1n (right

LOUIS (AP) -- Jonathan India had two hits to extend his hitting streak to nine games, Spencer Steer homered and the Cincinnati Reds beat the St. Louis Cardinals 11-4 on Thursday night.\n\nIndia had his sixth straight multi-hit game. He had reached safely in 11 consecutive at-bats before finally being retired Wednesday.\n\n\"We came out swinging,\" India said. \"Big win for us, but we need to keep going. You know we've been doing this the last four series, we win big the first game and then it doesn't turn out great the next.\"\n\nReds starter Andrew Abbott (7-6) was the winner, allowing two runs on two hits and six walks in five innings. Cincinnati won for the second time in six games.\n\n\"Probably one of the worst games I've pitched in my life,\" Abbott said. \"Just all over the place with timing, mechanic-wise. But yeah, team picked me up and we got a win. That's all that matters.\"\n\nMiles Mikolas (6-7) lasted 4 1/3 innings, allowing at least one run in each inning he pitched in. He gave up a career-high 10 runs, nine of them earned, on 12 hits and a walk.\n\n\"Just left a lot of pitches in the heart of the plate and they took some really good swings off of him and made him pay,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"They had really good at-bats, so throw this one out and keep moving on.\"\n\nNoelvi Marte, in his first game back for the Reds after serving an 80-game suspension for banned substances, had three hits, scored three runs and drove in another.\n\n\"I was just focusing myself on just the emotional aspect and just being ready to attack the zone,\" Marte said through an interpreter.\n\nElly De La Cruz had three hits and stole his major league-leading 38th base. Steer, Will Benson and Stuart Fairchild also had multi-hit games as the Reds scored double-digit runs for the seventh time this season.\n\nDe La Cruz's triple scored India to give the Reds a 1-0 lead in the first inning and India's RBI double added to the lead in the second. It is the fifth straight game that India has doubled in, the longest by a Red since India's four-game run from Sept. 24-27, 2021.\n\n\"I love hitting first and it just gives me more confidence to think I'm the guy that has to get on and I like that pressure,\" India said.\n\nSteer, Nick Martini and Marte each doubled and scored in the third to make it 5-0.\n\n\"Not hitting spots, kind of stunk out there,\" Mikolas said. \"Bullpen a little short-staffed, today was not a good day for me to stink. Work my tail off in between starts, make sure that doesn't happen again.\"\n\nSteer's homer in the fourth made it 7-2 Reds and Benson and Fairchild each had an RBI double to extend the lead to 10-2 in the fifth.\n\nNolan Arenado hit a two-run homer in the third for St. Louis, his first since June 5. Brendan Donovan and Dylan Carlson added RBI doubles in the eighth, as the Cardinals lost for the second time in their last seven games.\n\nReds catcher Tyler Stephenson was a late scratch from the lineup and was replaced by Luke Maile. Stephenson left the game to be with his pregnant wife.\n\n\"It's a team and that's the best way to say it,\" Reds manager David Bell said. \"It's challenging. We want everyone here and you know, healthy, but no one is talking about anything but, you know, finding a way to get it done. So, I think there's strength in that.\"\n\nTRANSACTIONS\n\nAside from reinstating Marte, the Reds optioned IF Livan Soto to Triple-A Louisville and moved RHP Emilio Pag\u00e1n (right lat strain) to the 60-day injured list.\n\nTRAINERS ROOM\n\nReds: OF Jake Fraley (right calf contusion) and 3B Jeimer Candelario (hamstring tendinitis) each missed their second straight game, but neither is expected to require an IL stint.\n\nCardinals: OF Lars Nootbaar (oblique strain) will begin a rehab assignment at Double-A Springfield on Friday.\n\nEditor's note: The Reds entered Friday night's game in St. Louis with a record of 38-43 putting them in fourth place in the National League Central Division, 10 games behind first-place Milwaukee (48-33).\n\nThe Cardinals are in second place in the Central Division (41-39), 6.5 games behind the Brewers.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates have a record of 39-41 and stand 8.5 games back of Milwaukee in third place.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs are 38-44, last in the

LOUIS -- Jonathan India had two hits to extend his hitting streak to nine games, Spencer Steer homered and the Cincinnati Reds beat the St. Louis Cardinals 11-4 on Thursday night.\n\nIndia had his sixth straight multi-hit game. He had reached safely in 11 consecutive at-bats before finally being retired Wednesday.\n\nReds starter Andrew Abbott (7-6) was the winner, allowing two runs on two hits and six walks in five innings. Cincinnati won for the second time in six games.\n\nMiles Mikolas (6-7) lasted 4 1/3 innings, allowing at least one run in each inning he pitched in. He gave up a career-high 10 runs, nine of them earned, on 12 hits and a walk.\n\nNoelvi Marte, in his first game back for the Reds after serving an 80-game suspension for banned substances, had three hits, scored three runs and drove in another.\n\nElly De La Cruz had three hits and stole his major league-leading 38th base. Steer, Will Benson and Stuart Fairchild also had multi-hit games as the Reds scored double-digit runs for the seventh time this season.\n\nDe La Cruz's triple scored India to give the Reds a 1-0 lead in the first inning and India's RBI double added to the lead in the second. It is the fifth straight game that India has doubled in, the longest by a Red since India's four-game run from Sept. 24-27, 2021.\n\nSteer, Nick Martini and Marte each doubled and scored in the third to make it 5-0 Reds.\n\nSteer's homer in the fourth made it 7-2 Reds and Benson and Fairchild each had an RBI double to extend the lead to 10-2 in the fifth.\n\nNolan Arenado hit a two-run homer in the third for St. Louis, his first since June 5. Brendan Donovan and Dylan Carlson added RBI doubles in the eighth, as the Cardinals lost for the second time in their last seven games.\n\nReds catcher Tyler Stephenson was a late scratch from the lineup and was replaced by Luke Maile. Stephenson left the game to be with his pregnant wife.\n\nTRANSACTIONS\n\nAside from reinstating Marte, the Reds optioned IF Livan Soto to Triple-A Louisville and moved RHP Emilio Pag\u00e1n (right lat strain) to the 60-day injured list.\n\nTRAINERS ROOM\n\nReds: OF Jake Fraley (right calf contusion) and 3B Jeimer Candelario (hamstring tendinitis) each missed their second straight game, but neither is expected to require an IL stint.\n\nCardinals: OF Lars Nootbaar (oblique strain) will begin a rehab assignment at Double-A Springfield on Friday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Cardinals will send RHP Andre Pallante (3-3, 5.23 ERA) to the mound in the second of a four-game series against the Reds and RHP Frankie Montas (3-5, 4.48 ERA) on Friday night.\n\nMore Reds news: McCutchen hits 2-run homer

In the third, Nick Martini would double home Spencer Steer. Noelvi Marte, making his return from his 80-game suspension, roped a sharp line drive to left-center field to score Martini and give the Reds a 4-0 lead.\n\nWith the Reds leading 5-2 in the fourth, Steer hit his 10th home run of the season into the left field seats. Benson followed with a line drive to left field that score Marte to extend the lead to 8-2. The Reds weren't done though in the inning as Stuart Fairchild doubled home Benson and Maile hit a sacrifice fly to give the Reds a 10-2 lead.\n\nThe Reds would get their 11th run of the night in the seventh when Fairchild singled home Marte. India, De La Cruz, Steer, Marte, Benson, and Fairchild all had multi-hit games to lead the Reds.\n\nNoelvi Marte Returns\n\nMarte returned after being suspended for the first 80 games of the season for taking performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nHe did not disappoint. He had three hits, including an RBI double, and scored all three times he reached base.\n\nAndrew Abbott Grinded Out of Trouble\n\nIn a game where Abbott really seemed to struggle with his command, he was still able to toss five innings of two-run baseball. He only allowed two hits, but walked six Cardinals' batters. He struck out two. His ERA is now 3.41 on the season.\n\nA key moment in the game came when St. Louis loaded the bases in the first with only one out. Abbott was able to strike out Nolan Arenado swinging and then got a ground out to get out of the inning unharmed.\n\nUp Next\n\nThe Reds and Cardinals will face off in game two if the series on Friday night at 8:15 ET.\n\nNews and Notes\n\nMake sure you bookmark Cincinnati Reds Talk for the latest news, exclusive interviews, and daily coverage of the Cincinnati Reds!\n\nYou May Also

He'll\n\nremain there for at least the next two weeks before he's re-evaluated according to the Enquirer's Charlie Goldsmith.\n\nThe incredibly bizarre saga of Christian Encarnacion-Strand and his injured wrist took a turn for the worst this week. The Reds' infielder has opted for surgery to repair the damage and is likely done for the year.\n\nThankfully Tyler Stephenson was able to avoid a stint on the injured list after taking a few games\n\noff with an undisclosed injury.\n\nHe was back in the lineup on Wednesday, but Jake Fraley and Jeimer Candelario were not. Both missed the game with leg injuries -- Fraley a contusion, Candelario hamstring tendonitis -- leaving David Bell even more shorthanded than usual against the Pirates.\n\nAfter an offseason chock full of stories about how deep the Reds roster was heading into spring training, that depth has been tested time and again. Nick Martini, Santiago Espinal, Levi Jordan, Livan Soto and Stuart Fairchild all made their way into the lineup on Wednesday. None of those guys were locks to make the roster in spring training.\n\nThe results were what you'd expect. Those five hitters combined to go 2-for-15 in a 6-1 loss to Pittsburgh. Although, to be fair, no one outside of a white hot Jonathan India did any damage at the plate.\n\nThe Reds desperately need a spark. They need something to go the organization's way. They need Noelvi Marte to be the catalyst to saving a season that started off with promise\n\nand playoff ambitions.\n\nIn 35 games last year, Marte emerged as arguably the best hitter in a crop of talented young prospects for the Reds. A future All-Star bat in the middle of Bell's lineup. Marte slashed .316/.366/.456 with three home runs, 15 runs batted in, six stolen bases and he still boasts an active 16-game hitting streak.\n\nThe optimism surrounding Marte and his contributions to a contending club in 2024 took a major hit in March when he was suspended 80-games by MLB after he tested positive for a banned anabolic-androgenic steroid.\n\n\"It just appeared in my system,\" Marte told beat writers earlier this month through interpreter Jorge Merlos. \"I really don't know how it came about, unfortunately.\"\n\nWhether or not the 22 year-old is telling the truth is honestly irrelevent. What's done is done. Now it's all about how Marte responds. Can he keep himself clean and avoid taking another step toward a life-time ban? Can he build off the impressive start he had to his big league career in 2023?\n\nThis is a Reds team that needs Marte to hit the ground running.\n\nThe organization and fans may want to temper their expectations. Marte struggled to get his timing down while rehabbing at Triple-A Louisville. In 12 games for the Bats he slashed .151/.151/.170, while striking out in over 28-percent of his plate appearances.\n\nHe's also been handed the tough draw of returning to the team on the road. Playing his first four games back in front of a potentially unforgiving St. Louis Cardinals' fanbase.\n\nEven if Marte doesn't hit right away, he does offer Bell some much needed roster\n\nflexibility.\n\nNoelvi should be penciled in as the starting third baseman everyday moving forward, allowing Jeimer Candelario a greater chance to play through his troubling tendonitis by getting more starts at first base and as the designated hitter.\n\n\"We can't wait to have him, not only as a player but the human being he is. He always\n\nhas a smile and a good atmosphere. A great kid who likes to work,\" Candelario told\n\nMLB.com's Mark Sheldon.\n\nThe return of Marte to the lineup could also allow Spencer Steer to be used in the outfield more frequently. It's an area where the Reds' offense really needs a boost, especially with Friedl out of action for the next few weeks and Fraley battling his own injury problems.\n\nThe Reds were hoping Will Benson would take the next step this year. He has all the athletic tools to be a great player, but the results just haven't been there.\n\nBell remains confident in his abilities, but it's not as though he's had much of a choice with the Reds' depth issues at the position. Benson was given a mental day of rest on Wednesday after collecting just one hit since June 8.\n\nMarte's return is not going to be enough to fill the Reds' current roster holes, but he represents the lone in-house candidate to help turn things around in the immediate future.\n\nThe expanded playoff format is likely to keep the Reds within striking distance of a wild card spot, but with Matt McLain not expected to return to the lineup until late August at the earliest, President of Baseball Operations Nick Krall is likely going to have to add pieces ahead of the trade deadline to keep Cincinnati in contention.\n\nBetween now and then, it's up to the pieces the Reds currently have in the clubhouse to\n\nbattle through the upcoming dog days of Summer.\n\nMake sure you bookmark Cincinnati Reds

It is the fifth straight game that India has doubled in, the longest by a Red since India's four-game run from Sept. 24-27, 2021.\n\n\"I love hitting first and it just gives me more confidence to think I'm the guy that has to get on and I like that pressure,\" India said.\n\nSteer, Nick Martini and Marte each doubled and scored in the third to make it 5-0.\n\n\"Not hitting spots, kind of stunk out there,\" Mikolas said. \"Bullpen a little short-staffed, today was not a good day for me to stink. Work my tail off in between starts, make sure that doesn't happen again.\"\n\nSteer's homer in the fourth made it 7-2 Reds and Benson and Fairchild each had an RBI double to extend the lead to 10-2 in the fifth.\n\nNolan Arenado hit a two-run homer in the third for St. Louis, his first since June 5. Brendan Donovan and Dylan Carlson added RBI doubles in the eighth, as the Cardinals lost for the second time in their last seven games.\n\nReds catcher Tyler Stephenson was a late scratch from the lineup and was replaced by Luke Maile. Stephenson left the game to be with his pregnant wife.\n\n\"It's a team and that's the best way to say it,\" Reds manager David Bell said. \"It's challenging.

He was banned for 80 games to start the season due to violating the league's Joint Drug Agreement after testing positive for a banned, performance-enhancing substance called Boldenone. The Reds officially reinstated him Thursday.\n\nMarte, 22, debuted last season and hit .316/.366/.456 (120 OPS+) with seven doubles, three homers, 15 RBI, 15 runs and 0.8 WAR in 35 games. He entered the season ranked as the No. 1 prospect for the Reds and 14th in all of baseball, per CBS Sports prospect guru R.J. Anderson.\n\nIn 12 rehab games with Triple-A Louisville, Marte hit just .151/.151/.170, striking out 15 times in 53 at-bats. Still, the Reds will hope a return to the majors jars something loose with the high-upside third baseman.\n\nThe Reds are a disappointing 37-43 right now, but that's good enough to trail the final wild-card spot by 4.5 games and that's workable. They have played Jeimer Candelario at third base the majority of the time so far this year, but he could also serve as DH. Reds designated hitters have only hit .210/.271/.335 this season, so that's where the ballclub can be hopeful the return of Mart\u00e9 helps the offense.\n\nAfter a big rebound in 2023 from a brutal 2022 season, the Reds were expected to be contenders this season, but lost Matt McLain and TJ Friedl to injury in spring training in addition to the Marte suspension.

Mandatory Credit: Kareem Elgazzar-USA TODAY Sports / Kareem Elgazzar-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds (38-43) dominated the St Louis Cardinals (41-39) by a score of 11-4.\n\nThe lineup absolutely exploded thanks to a huge night by Noelvi Marte. He returned from suspension with a huge performance as he went 3-for-5 with a double, and RBI, and three runs scored.\n\nOn a night like Thursday, a lot of guys had good performances at the plate, but none more welcome than Will Benson. He snapped an 0-for-25 slump with a two-hit night, including a double, two RBI, and two ruins scored.\n\nThe Reds scored at least one run in every inning until the sixth. The third inning blew the game wide open with three-straight doubles from Spencer Steer, Nick Martini, and Marte and then a sac fly from Benson to make it a three-run inning.\n\nAndrew Abbott had a bizarre start. He got the win after tossing five innings. He walked six Cardinal batters, but allowed just two hits and limited all the run scoring to a two-run homer. Buck Farmer, Brent Super, and Sam Moll then finished the game.\n\nThe one-two punch at the top of the Reds lineup continued to hit. Jonathan India went 2-for-4 with a double, RBI, and a run scored. Elly De La Cruz went 3-for-5 with a triple, RBI, and a run scored. De La Cruz also notched his 38th steal of the season.\n\nThe Reds will continue their four-game set with the Cardinals Friday at 8:15 PM ET. Frankie Montas will toe the rubber against the Cardinals Andre Pallante.\n\nMake sure you bookmark Cincinnati Reds Talk for the latest news, exclusive interviews, and daily coverage of the Cincinnati Reds!\n\nYou may also like:\n\nCan Noelvi Marte Provide the Spark the Reds Desperately Need?\n\nCincinnati Reds Make It Official, Activate Noelvi Marte From Suspension\n\nCBS Sports Gives Cincinnati Reds 'C' Grade on Midseason Report Card\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds Drop Another Series: Fall to Pittsburgh Pirates 6-1", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodyear_Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodyear Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodyear,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goodyear, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Goodyear, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford Cardinal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Pallante", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Pallante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Moll", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Moll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_India", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Montas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frankie Montas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Farmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buck Farmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8640,h_4860,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_reds/01j1eby7hkvyzrpf49vr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

He did a good job of preparing himself.\n\nReds Pete Rose 'Are they waiting for me to die?'

He missed time. But he did the work, and he got himself prepared. It's a great start.\"\n\nFor a team that even on this day was without its hot-hitting veteran infielder Jeimer Candelario (knee), right fielder Jake Fraley (calf) and starting catcher Tyler Stephenson (birth of first child), the big return raised at least one bittersweet question:\n\nIf this performance suggested even a hint of what Marte might have done in the first half, how much more might he have helped this listing lineup - and shaky infield defense - this season if that horse steroid had not found its way into his body?\n\nAnd this: How tough that might be for him to consider? Or how much responsibility does he take for not being available for those 80 games?\n\n\"I don't feel like I have any responsibility for that,\" Marte said in Spanish, with the help of team interpreter Jorge Merlos, reiterating Thursday that he still has no idea how the steroid got into his system.\n\n\"We have a great team here,\" Marte added. \"Things aren't (always) going to go our way. But I think I came at the right time, and (I'm) going to give it 100 percent. And our team is going to give it 100 percent. No one likes to lose.\"\n\nThe Reds have struggled to keep a productive lineup intact all season, without last year's best hitter, Matt McLain, all season because of a shoulder injury and more recently losing first baseman Christian Encarnacion-Strand to a season-ending wrist injury.\n\nMarte, a natural shortstop who has shown the ability to be a plus defender at third base for this team, looked like a potential Rookie of the Year candidate coming off a six-week, .316 debut last year, until getting popped for the positive test in spring training.\n\n\"It's time for Noelvi to play baseball,\" Bell said. \"He served his suspension. We move forward and play baseball.\"\n\nMarte said he went into Thursday \"just focusing myself on the emotional aspect and just being ready to attack the zone.\"\n\nAn uncharacteristically docile crowd at Busch Stadium that was taken out of the game by a lot of early Reds scoring provided a relatively soft landing for Marte for a return from the steroid suspension on the road.\n\nWhether that remains the case as the weekend crowds swell in St. Louis and the Reds continue on to raucous Yankee Stadium for a series next week, Marte already has said he's not thinking about anybody's reactions from outside the organization.\n\n\"He can't control that,\" Bell said. \"It's time to play baseball and be in the present moment. He already has everything else behind him. That's where we are right now. That's the focus.\"\n\nThat's what Bell said he talked to Marte about as the 22-year-old infielder returned Thursday.\n\nMarte said teammates showed him \"the same amount of love that they've given me in the past\" upon his return Thursday.\n\n\"I'm just appreciative that they've been able to receive me like that.\"\n\nMarte, who extended his big-league hitting streak to 17 games, dating to September, defied the lackluster results he showed in his two-week minor-league \"rehab\" assignment leading up to his season debut.\n\nThe double was his first extra-base hit in any official game since a double in his first rehab at-bat.\n\n\"You knew last year what he could add to the team with defense and hitting. That's a real bright spot for us,\" said Andrew Abbott, who picked a good night to have what he called his worst start, pushing through five innings (and six walks) for the win.\n\n\"No matter what, he's going to add value,\" Abbott said, \"whichever way - defense, offense, just being around, being a fun guy to be around. We're excited to have him back.\"\n\nHe figures to get the bulk of playing time as the Reds' starting third baseman until further notice and becomes the primary backup at short for All-Star candidate Elly De La Cruz, the only Red to play in all of the team's first 81 games.\n\nDe La Cruz also had three hits Thursday during the the Reds' 16-hit night.\n\nBell said he'd pick spots to \"ease\" Marte into a regular role after all the missed time.\n\nMarte makes no promises about performance going forward. And if he does manage to spark an offensive renaissance that helps push the Reds into the playoffs, he would be ineligible for the postseason.\n\n\"I don't know what exactly will happen out there, but I know I can give 100 percent of my ability to play as well as I can,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "lancastereaglegazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lancaster Eagle-Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Stephenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bell_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Bell (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sonny Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_India", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Fraley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Fraley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeimer_Candelario", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeimer Candelario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/02/15/PCIN/72618460007-021524-springtraining-0046.jpg?auto=webp&crop=8075,4543,x0,y420&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Video provided by Kings Island.\n\nST. LOUIS - Jonathan India is so hot since taking over for TJ Friedl at the top of the Cincinnati Reds lineup Monday that local meteorologists blamed him for the rising temps in east Missouri this weekend.\n\n\"I love hitting first. It just gives me more confidence,\" said the Reds' second baseman -- who's 11-for-19 with four walks and seven extra-base hits in five games since Friedl went on the injured list for a hamstring injury. \"I'm the guy that has to get on. I like that pressure. I definitely feel good at the top.\"\n\nIf he's feeling pressure, imagine how the rest of the Reds hitters must feel.\n\nIf Friday's fifth shutout of the short-handed, inconsistent Reds lineup this season showed anything, it's that India can't do it by himself. And that Noelvi Marte's return from a steroid suspension isn't a magic bullet for this team. And maybe that there isn't enough hitting in the vicinity to cash in on all those playoff plans this team had - at least not enough margin for a team playing short as many hitters as they were the last two games.\n\nCatcher Tyler Stephenson left Thursday and is on the paternity list to be with his wife and newborn. Jake Fraley (calf) and hot-hitting Jeimer Candelario (knee) missed the first two games of the Cardinals series.\n\nFraley, who was on deck with Stuart Fairchild ended the game with a fly to the wall in left, was expected back in the lineup Saturday; Candelario, Sunday.\n\n\"That would be a huge help,\" India said of getting those bats back. \"It'll be a big boost for our lineup, get some guys healthy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Reds managed just four hits against a Cardinals starter, Andre Pallante, who entered the game with a 5.23 ERA this season, none against the Cards bullpen, and went 1-for-10 with men in scoring position on the way to a 1-0 loss as they opened the second half of their season.\n\nWill Benson could only advance from second to third on a Stuart Fairchild bloop single to right in the fifth inning.\n\nIt was the fifth time in 82 games this season the Reds have been shut out, and they dropped to 6-15 in one-run games.\n\nIt was their ninth loss in 13 games overall.\n\nAnd it came one night after the Reds scored 11 in a rout of the Cardinals.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense, but it's a crazy game,\" India said.\n\n\"You win some you lose some,\" said Reds starter Frankie Montas, who has allowed just three runs in 12 innings (2.25 ERA) in his last two starts. \"When you lose like that, theres's really not much to say except it was a good game on both sides.\"\n\nThe lone run of the game Friday scored off Reds starter Montas in the third, when Alec Burleson skied a ball to shallow center that shortstop Elly De La Cruz caught with his back to the plate, rather than allow center fielder Fairchild to take it, and his throw to the plate was late and wide as speedy Michael Siani tagged and scored.\n\nManager David Bell said praised De La Cruz's exceptional ability to go deep for fly balls, but pointed out the conventional wisdom of Fairchild taking that ball and likely preventing the runner from attempting to score at all.\n\n\"That's how big of a difference it makes,\" Bell said, \"even as good as Elly is at going back and as good of an arm as he has.\"\n\nThe bigger difference in the game was the Reds' inability to cash in scoring chances and at least a few exceptional plays by the Cardinals' corner outfielders on balls hit by Santiago Espinal to left with two men on in the sixth, by Spencer Steer to right in the eighth with De La Cruz at first and Fairchild's ball to end the game.", "source": {"uri": "lancastereaglegazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lancaster Eagle-Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He tested positive for Boldenone during Spring Training, knocking Cincinnati's No. 1 prospect out for the first half of the 2024 regular season.\n\nThe Reds welcomed Marte back from a rehab assignment on Wednesday, even though he wasn't eligible to rejoin the roster until Thursday. To make room for Marte, Cincinnati had to option infielder Livan Soto to Triple-A Louisville and transfer right-handed pitcher Emilio Pagan to the 60-day injured list.\n\nMarte made his MLB debut in 2023, batting .316 with three home runs, 15 RBI, six stolen bases, an .822 OPS and a 0.8 WAR in 35 appearances. He is a .278 hitter with an .817 OPS in his minor league career, averaging 23 home runs, 99 RBI and 34 stolen bases per 162 games.\n\nDuring his rehab stint with Triple-A Louisville this month, however, Marte hit just .151 with two RBI, a stolen base and a .321 OPS across 12 games.\n\nEven with Marte back on the active roster, the Reds are still without two of their other top prospects who shined in the big leagues last season.\n\nInfielder Matt McLain, who finished fifth in NL Rookie of the Year voting in 2023, has been sidelined undergoing shoulder surgery in March.

LOUIS - The Cincinnati Reds might be starting to shed a well-earned reputation from early this season of not being able to beat good pitching.\n\nNow they just have to prove they can do more than streak-hit and occasionally take advantage of other teams' mistakes to win more games than they lose. And then maybe even prove they're capable of contending for a playoff spot in a mediocre National League field.\n\nWinning two out of the first three games of a four-game series in St. Louis is arguably a start as they crossed the halfway mark of the season, the Reds routing the Cards 9-4 on Saturday two days after pounding St. Louis 11-4.\n\nReds second baseman Jonathan India -- the NL Player of the Week frontrunner -- isn't making that argument yet. Not until he sees a bigger break from the team's recent pattern.\n\n\"We dominate a game, and then we take a step back,\" India said. \"Let's see how tomorrow goes.\"\n\nReds Cardinals Jonathan India Check out the franchise first Jonathan India pulled off Saturday for Cincinnati Reds\n\nReds Home Run Derby Elly De La Cruz Failure to launch: Cincinnati Reds SS Elly De La Cruz declines Home Run Derby invite again\n\nReds David Bell Pete Rose Cincinnati Reds manager David Bell sidesteps Pete Rose question: 'Not where my mind is'\n\nThe Reds had 29 combined hits in the two blowouts - started by Cards veterans Miles Mikolas and former Red Sonny Gray - including 13 doubles, two triples and a home run. In between? They lost 1-0 Friday.\n\n\"We're in a good spot. Our offense is clicking,\" India said. \"I don't know what it is. Let's just win tomorrow.\"\n\nMeanwhile, they peppered Gray, the former Red, with seven hits - four for extra bases - and knocked him out of the game during a six-run fifth inning extended by a rare Nolan Arenado error at third.\n\nCatcher Austin Wynns, who only joined the team from Triple-A Louisville because Tyler Stephenson is on paternity leave, doubled and scored the first run of the game in the third, among three doubles for him in the game.\n\n\"Three doubles is great, but I'm actually so happy that we were firing from all arsenals and we won,\" he said. \"We needed that. This is a big series, and that's a very good team.\n\n\"And Sonny Gray on paper, hello?\" Wynns said. \"The guy's a stud. It was a good day.\"\n\nIn beating the three-time All-Star, the Reds added to a list of victories over staff aces that includes the Phillies' Zack Wheeler, Giants' Logan Webb, Dodgers' Tyler Glasnow, Cubs' Justin Steele and Brewers' Freddy Peralta.\n\nThey're still looking for back-to-back wins for the first time in two weeks as Hunter Greene takes the mound Sunday against Lance Lynn. And they're still five games under .500 - and a lot closer to last place than first.\n\nBut the Reds' suddenly born-again lineup has given the Reds a much different look heading into July than they had during a miserable May that might yet prove their demise this season. Even with Stephenson away, leadoff man TJ Friedl back on the injured list (hamstring) and hot-hitting Jeimer Candelario missing the last four games with a sore knee.\n\nSaturday's win, on the strength of a six-run fifth inning, assured a winning June after that 9-18 May.\n\nCan they keep it up? In between the two big scoring binges, the Reds went 13 innings from the end of Thursday through the first two innings Saturday without a run. So stay tuned.\n\nIndia, pressed into full-time leadoff duty with Friedl down again, already was hot before reeling off six straight multi-hit games since then.\n\nHe's 13-for-22 (.591) in that stretch with four walks, nine doubles and was hit by a pitch (1.667 OPS).\n\nHis seven consecutive games with a double is a franchise record - and two short of Bo Bichette's big-league record. And he has an 11-game hitting streak.\n\n\"India just broke a record. So sick,\" Wynns said.\n\nLess of a wait-and-see proposition than the hitters is a pitching staff that got another strong start from rookie Carson Spiers, who earned a second consecutive win, going six innings and allowing just one earned run, on Paul Goldschmidt's two-out solo home run in the sixth - after retiring 11 of 12.\n\nReds starters allowed four earned runs in 17 innings the first three games in St. Louis (2.12 ERA).\n\n\"I went out there with one thing in mind: to give our team a chance to win,\" said Spiers (2-1), who has a 3.13 ERA in 37 1/3 innings across three stints with the big club this year.\n\n\"He's come a long way,\" said Wynns, who caught Spiers in spring training and at Triple-A before the right-hander commanded all four of his pitches all day long Saturday.",

It is the fifth straight game that India has doubled in, the longest by a Red since India\u00b4s four-game run from Sept. 24-27, 2021.\n\nSteer, Nick Martini and Marte each doubled and scored in the third to make it 5-0 Reds.\n\nSteer\u00b4s homer in the fourth made it 7-2 Reds and Benson and Fairchild each had an RBI double to extend the lead to 10-2 in the fifth.\n\nNolan Arenado hit a two-run homer in the third for St. Louis, his first since June 5. Brendan Donovan and Dylan Carlson added RBI doubles in the eighth, as the Cardinals lost for the second time in their last seven games.\n\nReds catcher Tyler Stephenson was a late scratch from the lineup and was replaced by Luke Maile. Stephenson left the game to be with his pregnant wife.\n\nTRANSACTIONS\n\nAside from reinstating Marte, the Reds optioned IF Livan Soto to Triple-A Louisville and moved RHP Emilio Pag\u00e1n (right lat strain) to the 60-day injured list.\n\nTRAINERS ROOM\n\nReds: OF Jake Fraley (right calf contusion) and 3B Jeimer Candelario (hamstring tendinitis) each missed their second straight game, but neither is expected to require an IL stint.\n\nCardinals: OF Lars Nootbaar (oblique strain) will begin a rehab assignment at Double-A Springfield on Friday.\n\nThe Cardinals will send RHP Andre Pallante (3-3, 5.23 ERA) to the mound in the second of a four-game series against the Reds and RHP Frankie Montas (3-5, 4.48 ERA) on Friday night.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals' Masyn Winn, right, is out at second base as Cincinnati Reds second baseman Jonathan India, throws to first during the first inning of a baseball game Thursday, June 27, 2024, in St. Louis.

Video provided by Kings Island.\n\nAsk columnist Jason Williams anything - sports or non-sports - and he'll pick some of your questions and respond on Cincinnati.com. Email: jwilliams@enquirer.com\n\nSubject: Cincinnati Reds manager David Bell's job performance\n\nMessage: When will you and the other Enquirer writers take off the kid gloves and begin being critically objective about the job that David Bell has done since he's been the manager of the Reds. He is mediocre at best, but you and your colleagues don't criticize him the way that he needs to be criticized concerning his handling of the Reds. Case in point is Will Benson. He's not even hitting his weight, but David Bell says he will come around in due time. Benson has talent for sure, but he does not need to be playing in Cincinnati.\n\nReply: Sounds like your criticism is more about what Bell says or doesn't say. Sounds like you're tired of the constant rah-rah messages Bell delivers to the media each day as the losses mount.\n\nYou may not like his approach, but Bell is being true to who he is. He prides himself on being a supportive player's manager. He believes it's the best way to get the most out of a young clubhouse. He's not a phony. He believes in the young core of this team to his core.\n\nNoelvi Marte returns: Reds won't wait for results to activate third baseman after steroid suspension\n\nWittenmyer & Williams What'll take for Reds to overcome bad baserunning?\n\nBell's approach also is in lockstep with what his boss, team president Nick Krall, wants - an emphasis on team chemistry and positive reinforcement. It's what Bell and Krall believe will help develop the Reds into a consistent winner.\n\nWere you complaining about Bell's approach at this time last year, when all those young guys were just coming up, tearing it up and turning the Reds into a surprise contender? He was saying the same things then.\n\nThere certainly are times when you'd like for Bell to be a little more critical in his assessment of the team's struggles. It's OK to be positive, and say you still believe in a slumping player and sputtering team. But there's nothing wrong with a little reality check.\n\nSomething like this, for example: We believe in Benson. We still see him as a big part of our future. He's putting in extra work, and we love that about him. But we can't keep playing him if this keeps up. He knows that. We know that.\n\nBell, in his sixth season as Reds manager, talks a lot about process. That's another thing fans don't want to hear. That'll happen when a franchise hasn't won a playoff series since Bill Clinton was in his first term.\n\nLike it or not, it is a process when you're developing a young team - especially one that's been plagued by a rash of injuries. Fans clamored for the Reds to establish a plan and stick to it. They finally have a plan, and they're trying to make it work.\n\nElly De La Cruz just passed the one-year mark since his big-league debut. Matt McLain, Noelvi Marte and Christian Encarnacion-Strand haven't played a full season in the majors yet. Nick Lodolo hasn't pitched a full healthy season.\n\nThere will come a time when these players aren't young anymore, and Bell's messages may not resonate. Dare I say, trust the process. Or don't trust the process. Either way, the Reds' plan needs more time.\n\nIf it becomes obvious the plan isn't working and we're still getting the same messages from Bell, then it'll be time to take the kid gloves off.", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bell_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Bell (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Williams_(basketball,_born_1975)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Williams (basketball, born 1975)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kings Island"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Benson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Benson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benson_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benson (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cincinnati_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Cincinnati Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roller coaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Krall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Krall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reinforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(punishment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (punishment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player-coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Player-coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Lodolo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Lodolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_McLain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt McLain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Writers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/23/PCIN/73811520007-may-22-reds-padres-9.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3899,2193,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 103, "textEnd": 110}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

LOUIS -- The St. Louis Cardinals must turn their attention to trying to salvage a split out of their four-game set with the Cincinnati Reds. The Cardinals sent their top pitcher Sonny Gray to the mound Saturday, but Gray got chased from the game before the end of the fifth inning.\n\nThe Cardinals' hopes of collecting a win came unraveled during a six-run fifth inning that included four hits, a walk, a hit batter and a fielding error as the Cardinals fell, 9-4, to the Reds in front of an announced crowd of 39,164 in the third game of their four-game series at Busch Stadium on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe teams will conclude their series Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Reds' offensive surge came the day after the Cardinals pitching staff led by Andre Pallante shut out the Reds to even the series.\n\nThe Cardinals (42-40) were held to just three hits through the first six innings, including a solo home run by first baseman Paul Goldschmidt (1 for 4) in the sixth. Goldschmidt's 11th home run of the season was one of just two extra-base hits for the Cardinals.\n\nMatt Carpenter (2 for 4) doubled and scored a run, while Michael Siani went 1 for 3 with an RBI. Nolan Arenado (2 for 4) also had a multi-hit game, and Nolan Gorman (1 for 3) walked and drove in a run.\n\nCardinals pitcher Sonny Gray (9-5) allowed six runs (three earned runs) on seven hits and one walk in 4 1/3 innings. He struck out six, and he threw 92 pitches without getting through five full innings. Four of the hits he allowed were extra-base hits.\n\nRookie right-hander Gordon Graceffo, a pitching prospect called up from the minors for the first time on Friday, made his major-league debut in relief. Graceffo allowed one run on three hits and two walks in 4 1/3 innings. He struck out four.\n\nA Sonny day and familiar faces\n\nGray made just his second career start against the Reds, a team he played for from 2019-2021. Reds pitching coach/director of pitching Derek Johnson served as Gray's pitching coach at Vanderbilt University as well as with the Reds.\n\nIn his most recent three starts entering the day, Gray allowed four runs on 10 hits and just three walks in 21 2/3 innings. He struck out 21 batters during that stretch and held opposing hitters to a .139 batting average. Gray posted a 1.66 ERA as well as a 2-0 record in those three starts, and he pitched at least seven innings in each of those outings.\n\nThe Reds (39-44) successfully created traffic on the bases with two outs in the first inning against Gray. A single up the middle by Spencer Steer on a ball that narrowly got past the second baseman, Gorman, on a short hop gave the Reds their first base runner.\n\nJake Fraley then followed with a single to left field to put two runners on with two outs.\n\nGray escaped unscathed thanks to a ground-ball hit by Noelvi Marte to Cardinals third baseman Arenado. The force out at third base ended the inning, a 19-pitch frame for Gray.\n\nGray retired the side in order on just seven pitches in the second inning.\n\nTwo runs on three swings against Gray\n\nThe Reds took a 2-0 lead in the third inning thanks to RBI doubles by double play partners Jonathan India and Elly De La Cruz.\n\nCatcher Austin Wynns started the frame off with a double into the right field corner. Then India, the Reds' leadoff hitter, became the first player in Reds history to double in seven consecutive games, and he gave the Reds a 1-0 lead with the opposite-field poke up the left field line that bounced over the side wall and into the stands.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nIndia entered the day with a 10-game hitting streak that included seven consecutive multi-hit games. He joined Joe Morgan as the only Reds with multiple hits, including at least one extra-base hit, in seven straight games.\n\nIndia's double was the second in a string of three consecutive doubles for the Reds in the third inning.\n\nSiani's single cuts lead in half\n\nFor the second time in as many days, the Cardinals' first run came in the third inning.\n\nOn Saturday, Carpenter smacked a leadoff double off of Reds right-hander Carson Spiers (2-1) in the third, and Siani followed with an RBI single to center field.\n\nSiani, who doubled and scored the team's lone run Friday night, entered the day on a five-game hitting streak. During that span, he'd gone 7 for 12 at the plate.\n\nThe Cardinals settled for one run in the inning after a fly ball by Masyn Winn, a popup in foul territory by Alec Burleson and a sharply hit ground ball by Willson Contreras.\n\nThe Reds held a 2-1 edge through three innings.\n\nReds put the heat on Gray\n\nGray got India to ground out to Arenado to start the fifth, but De La Cruz tripled on the first pitch of the next at-bat. Then Steer walked on five pitches. After Steer stole second base to stay out of the double play possibility, Jake Fraley fouled off four 3-2 pitches before Gray hit Fraley with a pitch.\n\nGray's sinker that veered up and in and hit Fraley marked his 88th pitch of the game. Gray threw four more pitches, but Marte hit a grounder that Arenado did not field cleanly. That error by Arenado allowed the Reds to score their third run of the day without an out recorded on the play.\n\nGray exited the game with one run having scored and the bases loaded with one out in the fifth inning.\n\nReliever John King got Nick Martini to line out to Winn at shortstop for the second out of the inning, but the Reds reeled off back-to-back two-run singles by Stuart Fairchild and Will Benson. The Benson single deflected off of the glove of the second baseman, Gorman, and caromed into center field.\n\nWynns doubled on a grounder down the third base line that Arenado got his glove on, but couldn't scoop up. The double drove in the sixth run of the inning and ended the outing for King.\n\nTwo of the runs scored in the inning were charged to King, while the other four were charged to Gray.\n\nA one-run game entering the fifth inning turned into an 8-1 Reds lead.\n\n\u00a92024 STLtoday.com.

India is the first known Reds player in franchise history to do so.\n\nAs of this posting, India is hitting .278 this season with five homers and 33 RBI. In a year where the Reds have dealt with a subpar performance from Jeimer Candelario and a suspension of top prospect Noelvi Marte, India has certainly done his part to keep the offense afloat.\n\nThe 27-year-old out of Florida is in his fourth big league season, having won the Rookie of the Year Award in 2021. He's a lifetime .259 hitter who has 53 career homers and 204 RBI.\n\nThe Reds entered play on Saturday at 38-44 on the year and if they happen to fall out of the race even further, there is a chance that he could be traded. While the trade chatter hasn't been as prevalent this spring/summer, there were thoughts all offseason that India was going to be dealt. Now that Marte is back from his PED suspension, India is certainly more expendable and the talks could resurface again.\n\nAt the time of this posting, the Reds lead the Cardinals 3-1. The two teams will finish out the series on Sunday afternoon at Busch Stadium.\n\nThe Reds will be off on Monday before taking on the Yankees on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_India", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Busch Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeimer_Candelario", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeimer Candelario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Escobar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Escobar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6359,h_3576,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastball/01j1jqyr1snfzpz05yxc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 142, "textEnd": 149}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

In corresponding moves, they optioned infielder Liv\u00e1n Soto and transferred right-hander Emilio Pag\u00e1n to the 60-day injured list.\n\nMart\u00e9, 22, had an excellent debut for the Reds last year. Long considered one of the top prospects in the league, he was called up in August of last year and hit .316/.366/.456 in his first 35 games at the major league level. That set him up to be a key part of the 2024 club but he was hit with an 80-game suspension in early March after testing positive for Boldenone.\n\nThat has been just one of several notable absences for the Reds this year. Matt McLain, TJ Friedl and Christian Encarnacion-Strand have all missed significant time due to injury, with several pitchers having spent time on the IL as well. Those health problems and Mart\u00e9's suspension have left the club fairly hamstrung so far on the season.\n\nThose issues have contributed to a fairly lackluster performance from the club, as the Reds are currently 37-43. That leaves them only 4.5 games out of a playoff spot in the fairly weak National League Wild Card race, but many expected better results this year after the club seemed to be overflowing with young talent towards the end of last year.\n\nThe return of Mart\u00e9 could perhaps give them a boost, though for what it's worth, he hasn't been in good form after his layoff. He began a rehab assignment a couple of weeks ago and hit .151/.151/.170 in 15 Triple-A games. That's a small sample size and perhaps some rust is expected after missing time, but the Reds will obviously hope for better than that going forward.\n\nThe Reds still have McLain, Friedl and Encarnacion-Strand on the injured list while Jake Fraley and Jeimer Candelario are each dealing with minor ailments. Despite Mart\u00e9's poor form during his rehab, he might get some runway to get in a good place with so many other players ailing. He was primarily playing third base during his rehab, which has been Candelario's home for much of this season. Santiago Espinal has been covering that spot lately but is hitting just .203/.253/.297 on the year. Even when Candelario is healthy again, he is capable of moving over to first base, while regular first baseman Spencer Steer could perhaps move into the corner outfield mix.\n\nAs for Pag\u00e1n, he landed on the 15-day injured list June 9 due to a right lat strain. This transfer suggests the Reds don't expect him back until early August in a best-case scenario. He signed a two-year, $16MM deal in the offseason, with the chance to opt out after one year. He has a mediocre 4.43 earned run average on the year and seemingly won't have a ton of time to improve that number after this IL stint. The Reds could look to improve their bullpen prior to the trade deadline, but their aggressiveness in that department will depend on how the club plays over the next month.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darragh_mcdonald@mlbtraderumors.com", "name": "Darragh McDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liv\u00e1n_Soto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liv\u00e1n Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TJ_Friedl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TJ Friedl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_McLain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt McLain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Pag\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emilio Pag\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Steer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Steer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Espinal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Espinal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Fraley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Fraley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeimer_Candelario", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeimer Candelario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Words_and_Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Words and Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2024/06/noelvi-marte-reds-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 2439, "textEnd": 2445}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Or how much responsibility he takes for not being available for those 80 games.\n\n\"I don't feel like I have any responsibility for that,\" Marte said in Spanish, with the help of team interpreter Jorge Merlos, reiterating Thursday that he still has no idea how the steroid got into his system.\n\n\"We have a great team here,\" Marte added. \"Things aren't (always) going to go our way. But I think I came at the right time, and (I'm) going to give it 100 percent. And our team is going to give it 100 percent. No one likes to lose.\"\n\nThe Reds have struggled to keep a productive lineup intact all season, without last year's best hitter, Matt McLain, all season because of a shoulder injury and more recently losing first baseman Christian Encarnacion-Strand to a season-ending wrist injury.\n\nMarte, a natural shortstop who has shown the ability to be a plus defender at third base for this team, looked like a potential Rookie of the Year candidate coming off a six-week, .316 debut last year, until getting popped for the positive test in spring training.\n\n\"It's time for Noelvi to play baseball,\" Bell said. \"He served his suspension. We move forward and play baseball.\n\n\"He needs to be out on the field and continuing to develop and getting better.\"\n\nAn uncharacteristically docile crowd at Busch Stadium that was taken out of the game by a lot of early Reds scoring provided a relatively soft landing for Marte for a return from the steroid suspension on the road.\n\nWhether that remains the case as the weekend crowds swell in St. Louis and the Reds continue to raucous Yankee Stadium for a series next week, Marte already has said he's not thinking about anybody's reactions from outside the organization.\n\n\"He can't control that,\" Bell said. \"It's time to play baseball and be in the present moment. He already has everything else behind him. That's where we are right now. That's the focus.\"\n\nThat's what Bell said he talked to Marte about as the 22-year-old infielder returned Thursday.\n\nMarte said teammates showed him \"the same amount of love that they've given me in the past\" upon his return Thursday.\n\n\"I'm just appreciative that they've been able to receive me like that.\"\n\nMarte, who extended his big-league hitting streak to 17 games, dating to September, defied the lackluster results he showed in his two-week minor-league \"rehab\" assignment leading up to his season debut.\n\nThe double was his first extra-base hit in any official game since a double in his first rehab at-bat.\n\nHe figures to get the bulk of playing time as the Reds' starting third baseman until further notice and becomes the primary backup at short for All-Star candidate Elly De La Cruz, the only Red to play in all of the team's first 81 games.\n\nDe La Cruz also had three hits Thursday during the the Reds' 16-hit night.\n\nMarte makes no promises about performance going forward. And if he does manage to spark an offensive renaissance that helps push the Reds into the playoffs, he would be ineligible for the postseason.\n\n\"I don't know what exactly will happen out there, but I know I can give 100 percent of my ability to play as well as I can,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bell_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Bell (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Stephenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Fraley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Fraley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeimer_Candelario", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeimer Candelario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_McLain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt McLain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/02/15/PCIN/72618460007-021524-springtraining-0046.jpg?auto=webp&crop=8075,4543,x0,y420&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The Cardinals sent their top pitcher Sonny Gray to the mound on Saturday, but Gray got chased from the game before the end of the fifth inning.\n\nThe Cardinals' hopes of collecting a win came unraveled during a six-run fifth inning that included four hits, a walk, a hit batter and a fielding error as the Cardinals fell, 9-4, to the Reds in front of an announced crowd of 39,164 in the third game of their four-game series at Busch Stadium on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe teams will conclude their series on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Reds' offensive surge came the day after the Cardinals pitching staff led by Andre Pallante shut out the Reds to even the series.\n\nThe Cardinals (42-40) were held to just three hits through the first six innings, including a solo home run by first baseman Paul Goldschmidt (1 for 4) in the sixth. Goldschmidt's 11th home run of the season was one of just two extra-base hits for the Cardinals in the game.\n\nJanet Jackson, with Nelly opener, mostly wows crowd at Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Acclaimed St. Louis restaurant Bulrush closes.

Nolan Arenado (2 for 4) also had a multi-hit game, and Nolan Gorman (1 for 3) walked and drove in a run.\n\nCardinals pitcher Sonny Gray (9-5) allowed six runs (three earned runs) on seven hits and one walk in 4 1/3 innings. He struck out six, and he threw 92 pitches without getting through five full innings. Four of the this he allowed were extra-base hits.\n\nRookie right-hander Gordon Graceffo, a pitching prospect called up from the minors for the first time on Friday, made his major-league debut in relief. Graceffo allowed one run on three hits and two walks in 4 1/3 innings. He struck out four.\n\nA Sonny day and familiar faces\n\nGray made just his second career start against the Reds, a team he played for from 2019-2021. Reds pitching coach/director of pitching Derek Johnson served as Gray's pitching coach at Vanderbilt University as well as with the Reds.\n\nIn his most recent three starts entering the day, Gray allowed four runs on 10 hits and just three walks in 21 2/3 innings. He struck out 21 batters during that stretch and held opposing hitters to a .139 batting average. Gray posted a 1.66 ERA as well as a 2-0 record in those three starts, and he pitched at least seven innings in each of those outings.\n\nThe Reds (39-44) successfully created traffic on the bases with two outs in the first inning against Gray. A single up the middle by Spencer Steer on a ball that narrowly got past the second baseman, Gorman, on a short hop gave the Reds their first base runner.\n\nJake Fraley then followed with a single to left field to put two runners on with two outs.\n\nGray escaped unscathed thanks to a groundball hit by Noelvi Marte to the Cardinals third baseman, Arenado. The force out at third base ended the inning, a 19-pitch frame for Gray.\n\nGray retired the side in order on just seven pitches in the second inning.\n\nTwo runs on three swings against Gray\n\nThe Reds took a 2-0 lead in the third inning thanks to RBI doubles by double play partners Jonathan India and Elly De La Cruz.\n\nCatcher Austin Wynns started the frame off with a double into the right field corner. Then India, the Reds' leadoff hitter, became the first player in Reds history to double in seven consecutive games, and he gave the Reds a 1-0 lead with the opposite-field poke up the left field line that bounced over the side wall and into the stands.\n\nIndia entered the day with a 10-game hitting streak that included seven consecutive multi-hit games. He joined Joe Morgan as the only Reds with multiple hits, including at least one extra-base hit in seven straight games.\n\nIndia's double was the second in a string of three consecutive doubles for the Reds in the third innings.\n\nSiani's single cuts lead in half\n\nFor the second time in as many days, the Cardinals' first run came in the third inning.\n\nOn Saturday, Carpenter smacked a leadoff double off of Reds right-hander Carson Spiers (2-1) in the third, and Siani followed with an RBI single to center field.\n\nSiani, who doubled and scored the team's lone run on Friday night, entered the day on a five-game hitting streak. During that span, he'd gone 7 for 12 at the plate.\n\nThe Cardinals settled for one run in the inning after a fly ball by Masyn Winn, a pop up in foul territory by Alec Burleson and a sharply-hit ground ball by Willson Contreras.\n\nThe Reds held a 2-1 edge through three innings.\n\nReds put the heat on Gray\n\nGray got India to ground out to Arenado to start the fifth inning, but De La Cruz tripled on the first pitch of the next at-bat. Then Steer walked on five pitches. After Steer stole second base to stay out of the double play possibility, Jake Fraley fouled off four 3-2 pitches before Gray hit Fraley with a pitch.\n\nGray's sinker that veered up and in and hit Fraley marked his 88th pitch of the game. Gray threw four more pitches, but Marte hit a grounder to Arenado that he could not field cleanly. That error by Arenado allowed the Reds to score their third run of the day without an out recorded on the play.\n\nGray exited the game with one run having scored and the bases loaded with one out in the fifth inning.\n\nReliever John King got Nick Martini to line out to Winn at shortstop for the second out of the inning, but the Reds reeled off back-to-back two-run singles by Stuart Fairchild and Will Benson. The Benson single deflected off of the glove of the second baseman, Gorman, and caromed into center field.\n\nWynns doubled on a grounder down the third base line that Arenado got his glove, but couldn't scoop up. The double drove in the sixth run of the inning and ended the outing for King.\n\nTwo of the runs scored in the inning were charged to King, while the other four were charged to Gray.\n\nA one-run game entering the fifth inning turned into an 8-1 Reds lead.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They are 18-9 in the first game of a series. It's the games after that where they play with flat tires.\n\nIn the previous series, they beat Pittsburgh in the opener, 11-5, then lost the next two. In the opener against Boston they won, 5-2, then lost the next two.\n\n\"We need to keep going. We've been doing this the last four series, win big the first game and then it doesn't turn out good,\" said Jonathan India during a post-game interview on Bally Sports Ohio. \"We have to keep our foot on the pedal and come out ready tomorrow.\"\n\nStars were abundant for the Reds.\n\nNoelvi Marte returned from his 80-game suspension and celebrated with three hits that included a double, three runs, an RBI and a stolen base.\n\nAsked if Marte's return lit a spark, India said, \"Yeah, for sure. He's a helluva player, a multi-talent. Look what he did tonight. A great game. Came out swinging like he usually does. It's big for our lineup.\"\n\nWill Benson emerged from his 0 for 25 slump cocoon with two hits that included two RBI and two runs scored.\n\n\"Being able to contribute to the win is a great feeling,\" he said. \"This is what of the blessings and curses of this game. You learn a lot about yourself and you do some soul-searching alot. When I struggle I just double down on the work that I put in.\"\n\nIndia doubled his first two times to reach bases 13 times in 15 plate appearances. It was his sixth straight multi-hit game and extended his hitting streak to nine games.\n\nHe has been sizzling since T.J. Friedl landed on the injured list and manager David Bell put India in Friedl's leadoff spot.\n\n\"I love hitting first,\" he said. \"It gives me more confidence. I'm the guy who has to get on. I like that pressure. Yeah, I definitely feel good at the top.\"\n\nThe home run was provided by Spencer Steer to go with a double that produced two RBI and two runs scored.\n\nThe triple came in the personage of Elly De La Cruz for two RBI. He also singled twice and stole his league-leading 38th base on a pitchout.\n\nPitching? It was the most bizarre night of Reds starter Andrew Abbott's career.\n\nHe walked six batters in five innings and survived the game only because the Reds were running the bases like a high-speed carousel.\n\nHe walked four of the first seven batters he faced. He walked the bases loaded in the first inning with one out, but escaped by striking out Nolan Arenado and coaxing an inning-ending ground ball from Jose Fermin.\n\nDespite the walks, Abbott survived by giving up only two hits during his 102 pitches for his five innings.\n\nHis fifth walk came on a full count to Willson Contreras in the third. Arenado then homered, the first and only legitimate hit off Abbott. The other hit was an infield dribbler up the third-base line by Contreras in the fifth.\n\nThe Reds quickly showed they were not just in town to catch a glimpse of the Mississippi River. India opened the game with a single and De La Cruz tripled him home.\n\nThey added one in the second on Benson's slump-busting single and India's double. They scored three in the third on three straight doubles by Steer, Nick Martini and Marte, plus Benson's sacrifice fly to make it 5-0.\n\nArenado's homer in the third cut it to 5-2, but the Reds retrieved those two in the fourth on Steer's two-run, two-out home run.\n\nIt swelled to 10-2 in the fifth with a Cincinnati three-spot on run-scoring doubles by Benson and Stuart Fairchild and a sacrifice fly by Luke Maile.\n\nMaile was the only Reds starter without a hit. Marte, De La Cruz each had three hits. Benson was robbed of a third hit in the ninth when right fielder Dylan Carlson crashed against the ball to snag a hard-hit line drive.\n\nMaile was a quick lineup insert just prior to the game when catcher Tyler Stephenson left to be with his wife as she gave birth.\n\nOf Marte's return and quick placement in the lineup, manager David Bell said, \"It's time for Marte to play baseball. He served his 80-game suspension, now it is time for him to just play ball and continue to develop and improve.\"\n\nMarte played third base, where Jeimer Candelario has been playing. Candelario is nursing tendinitis. And what happens when he returns.\n\n\"We'll use him, fit him in, as a designated hitter,\" said Bell.\n\nMarte finished last season on a 17-game hitting streak and 23 straight games on base. And he picked up right where he left off.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On Friday? Zero runs. Four hits.\n\nAnd they lost, 1-0 ... and the one run was dubious, spoiling an above-and-beyond start by Reds pitcher Frankie Montas.\n\nThe one-run numbers are ugly. The Reds are 9-16 in one-run games while the Cardinals are 15-11.\n\nOn this night, the Reds had opportunity after opportunity after opportunity, but couldn't even open the door a crack. They stranded eight and were 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position. And that one hit only moved a runner from second to third.\n\nThe one run shouldn't have scored. It happened in the third inning and began when Michael Siani, the Reds No. 4 draft choice in 2018 and batting ninth, opened the inning with a line drive double that put a dent in the right field wall.\n\nHe moved to third on a ground ball and Alec Burleson lifted a shallow pop fly just beyond second base. It was center fielder Stuart Fairchild's ball.\n\nBut shortstop Elly De La Cruz raced out and caught the ball with his back to the infield. The speedy Siani tagged and fled home to score.\n\nDe La Cruz had to turn and hurry an errant throw home. Fairchild's momentum was toward home plate, more in position to catch and throw. If he catches the ball, Siani probably would not have tried to score.\n\nReds manager David Bell agreed.\n\n\"If Stu (Fairchild) comes in to catch that ball, they probably don't run right there. They did a good job of tagging up right there. We teach the same thing,\" said Bell on Bally Sports Ohio\n\n\"For us, Elly is so good at going back on the ball and we want the ball in Elly's hands,\" Bell added. \"It was a pop-up in the infield that drifted a little bit ... but, yes, if Stu was able to read that and make the charge, they probably wouldn't have run.\"\n\nThe same situation surfaced fpr the Cardinals in the fifth ... only the Cardinals did it right. Cincinnati's Will Benson was on third with one out. Luke Maile popped one to shallow center, but deeper than the ball Burleson hit for the sacrifice fly.\n\nLike De La Cruz, St. Louis shortstop Brandon Crawford chased after it. But center fielder Siani, charging in, called Crawford off and made the catch. Benson remained anchored at third.\n\nThe game ended dramatically, a near-miss game-tying home run by Fairchild.\n\nSt. Louis closer Ryan Helsley retired the first two in the ninth. Fairchild swung at the first pitch and drove one to left that was headsed for homerland.\n\nBut left fielder Brendon Donovan had other ideas. After a long run, he leaped above the wall and plucked the ball out of the air before it cleared the wall, ending the game.\n\nHelslely, who blew his first save situation against the Los Angeles Dodgers, now has 29 straight saves to lead MLB.\n\n\"Yeah, I thought it had a chance, but this is a big ball park,\" said Bell about Fairchild's near game-tying homer. \"Off the bat. . .a great swing by Stu ... that's all you can do is put a good swing on the ball.\"\n\nIt looked so promising in the first inning when the Reds collected two hits. But they didn't score and managed two more hits over the final eight innings.\n\nJonathan India, Mr. Get-On-Base, opened the game with a single, extending his hitting streak to 10 games. Spencer Steer singled with one out, but Nick Martini hit into a double play.\n\nIndia doubled with two outs in the third, pushing his mutli-hit games to seven straight, but De La Cruz grounded out.\n\nThey loaded the bases in the fifth on two walks, one by India, and a single by Fairchild, but once again De La Cruz grounded out.\n\nThe first two Reds reached base in the sixth and Donovan did another dirty deed. After Noelvi Marte flied meekly to left, Santiago Espinal pulled one toward the left field corner. After a long, long run, Donovan chased it down, robbing Espinal of a two-run double. Benson then struck out.\n\nOne last chance surfaced in the eighth when De La Cruz led with a full-count walk. The Cardinals slapped some more leather on the Reds. Spencer Steer lobbed one to short right and Burleson made a long run before making a diving, sliding catch.\n\nPinch-hitter Levi Jordan missed a bunt attempt and catcher Willson Contreras made a snap throw to first. Umpire Charlie Ramos called De La Cruz out. The Reds challenged and after a long, long delay New York reversed the call and called him safe.\n\nDe La Cruz stole second, his 39th, and took third on Jordan's fly ball, but Marte struck out and that was it.\n\nSt. Louis starter Andre Pallante held the Reds to four hits over 5 1/3 innings and was credited with the win and is 5-0 for his career against the Reds.\n\nMontas was even better -- one dubious run and two hits over his six innings and his reward was a sixth loss in his last seven decisions.\n\n\"I thought it was a really good game on both sides,\" said a magnanimous Montas. \"I felt good with my stuff but the result wasn't what I wanteed.\"", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So, some of you \"older\" folks may recognize the title instantly, and remember that it was a fun tune done by the Southern rockers from Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nThe song title also felt right for the subject matter I wanted to touch on before delving into my diatribe about what is going on with the Cincinnati Reds. That would be the fact that the more we may think we know about a particular\n\nsubject, the more we still have to learn. In this case, I'm referring to baseball.\n\nWhile he was growing up, there's no doubt that my son Chris got weary of hearing my declaration, \"I may not know much, but I know baseball.\"\n\nThe love of the game was ingrained in me by my dad before I even began kindergarten. That love and appreciation for baseball was passed on to my son, and he's continued the tradition by passing it on to his son, my 10-year-old grandson, Owen.\n\nI suppose I do know a little about the sport, but the older I get, the more I realize that baseball is not something that is completely figured out by anyone, and unexpected, unexplainable, and inexplicable things occur on the field day after day and year after year.\n\nAll I'm saying is that if you think you know all there is to know about baseball, think again. Hall of Fame manager Leo Durocher realized it\n\nmany years ago, when he said, \"Baseball is like church. Many attend, few understand.\"\n\nFollowing is just one example before I bore y'all to tears:\n\nHow does one explain that when you think you know how a team will perform, they turn around and do just the opposite? Take last night's (Thursday's) Cincinnati Reds game at St. Louis. The Reds came limping into the Gateway City, and fielded a patchwork lineup to face the Cardinals, a team that had won 24 of its last 40 games, and risen from the cellar of the NL Central to second place. Logic would tell you the Reds had little chance of winning, but what does logic have to do with baseball?\n\nA team struggling to hit the ball for weeks, the visitors were also playing shorthanded. In addition to having starting centerfielder TJ Friedl on the injured list again, several other banged-up regulars were held out of the lineup. Jeimer Candelario, the team's most consistent hitter for several weeks, and .277-hitting Jake\n\nFraley were ruled out due to nagging, but hopefully not serious, injuries.\n\nClean-up hitter and starting catcher Tyler Stephenson was yanked from the lineup just before game time when he received some special news. The team even got a few moments in the dugout to celebrate the impending birth of a daughter before he departed for South Carolina, where Stephenson's wife was about to give birth to the couple's first child.\n\nSo, what do the Reds do?\n\nThey bang out 16 hits, and wallop the Redbirds 11-4. Of course they do. Just what everyone thought this lineup would do. Yeah right.\n\nThe Reds have been getting better production from the top of the lineup in recent days. Jonathan India looks better than he has in quite a while in the leadoff spot, Elly De La Cruz is heating up while making better contact, Spencer Steer is providing much-needed pop,\n\nand we already mentioned Candelario and his hot bat.\n\nAnother huge boost came from third baseman Noelvi Marte, who was making his Reds season debut after being suspended for the first 80 games due to a failed PED test. Marte, who finished the 2023 season flashing his potential and swinging a potent bat, should help the lineup immensely. He struggled at Triple-A Louisville, but showed he's more than capable by getting three hits against the Cardinals in his first game back.\n\nMarte is also an obvious improvement defensively and gives the club even more speed. With him manning the hot corner, Candelario, who was no Nolan Arenado at the position, can shift to a DH-1B role.\n\nEven Will Benson got into the act, snapping a zero-for-25 stretch with a pair of hits, a couple of runs and two runs batted in. It lifted Benson's batting average to .194, which is\n\nabout par for the course for more than a few Reds.\n\nWhether the club continues to play well and return home July 5 with some positive momentum while playing three more games in St. Louis and three in Yankee Stadium remains a huge challenge, but stranger things have happened. The hometown nine could also make a bit of a run before the All-Star Game with a winnable 10-game homestand. The Reds host the Detroit Tigers for three games, the Colorado Rockies for four, and the Miami Marlins for three before the break. Those three teams have a combined 93-149 record as of this writing on June 28.\n\nThe outlook for the rest of the season remains up in the air, but the Reds should be able to put together a better second half and make a run at a Wild Card spot. That would appear to be the only goal this team can realistically hope to achieve. I just don't see them catching and passing Milwaukee to take the NL Central. With\n\n81 games down and 81 to go, the 38-43 Reds sit 10 games behind the Brewers.\n\nCincinnati needs to do exponentially better when it plays divisional foes, which has been an issue for years it seems. The Reds also need to get a lot more offensive production from their outfield, consistently effective pitching, and play much better fundamental baseball. Mental lapses on the bases and in the field have been difficult to watch, and if that isn't addressed in a positive manner, this team is going nowhere.\n\nManager David Bell, who receives tons of criticism from Reds fans (some of which is deserved), also needs to do a better job. Some of his decisions and his mild-mannered approach are at the very least, questionable. He should also transfer some of the fire and brimstone he directs at umpires to some of his players, especially when they aren't mentally into the game.\n\nGranted, he has and has had limited options for most of the season, and we all know who is at\n\nfault for that. Yep, that would be the ownership and front office, who continue to do next to nothing to improve the club. The free agent acquisitions, with the exception of Candelario in recent weeks, that the front office brought in during the offseason have been less than effective. The decisions from the Castellini family and the minority owners appear to be based more on profit than winning baseball, and it's doubtful that will change anytime soon.\n\nWith all that said, there remains some hope, but the Reds need to finish with at least 82 or more wins to claim a Wild Card, which means at the very least, a 44-37 record over the final 81 games.\n\nI reckon that's doable, but it's also unlikely. But what do I know?\n\nMore quotes from Willie Mays: \"Youngsters of Little League can survive under-coaching a lot better than over-coaching.\"\n\n\"Never assume the other guy will never do something you would never do.\"\n\n\"I remember the last season I played. I went home after a ballgame one day, lay down on the bed, and tears came to my eyes. How can you explain that? You cry because you love her. I cried, I guess, because I love baseball and I knew I had to leave it.\"\n\n*****\n\n\"We are called the nation of inventors. And we are. We could still claim the title and wear its loftiest honors if we had stopped with the first thing we ever invented, which was human liberty.\" - Mark Twain", "source": {"uri": "s25849.pcdn.co",

But Saturday afternoon's game was played on the 90-degree grass of Busch Stadium, not on an 8 x11 piece of paper.\n\nAnd the Cincinnati Reds treated nine-game winner and former Reds pitcher Sonny Gray like Sonny Bono during a 9-4 blitz of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe Reds pummeled Gray for six runs and seven hits in 4 1/3 innings, the most runs he has given up at Busch this season, where he usually as is untouchable as Eliot Ness.\n\nSix runs and seven hits off Gray is like finding gold in an outhouse.\n\nIn his previous start, Gray took a perfect game into the seventh inning against the San Francisco Giants. On this day he was far from perfect.\n\nMeanwhile, Spiers did his best Sonny Gray imitation, holding the Cardinals to two runs, only one earned, in a dazzling display of muzzling the potent St. Louis offense.\n\nThe 26-year-old right-hander gave up only three hits while walking one and striking out four. The unearned run came in the third inning when Reds third baseman Noelvi Marte dropped Matt Carpenter's pop foul for his second error of the game. Carpenter then doubled and scored on Michael Siani's single.\n\nThe earned run came when Paul Goldschmidt homered with two outs in the sixth when the Reds led, 8-1.\n\nAs unlikely as it was for the Reds to beat up Gray, there was an unlikely hitting star for the Reds.\n\nIt was catcher Austin Wynns, called up from Class AAA Louisville to fill in for Tyler Stephenson, home in South Carolina on paternity leave.\n\nWynns had three hits, all doubles, that produced an RBI and two runs scored as the Reds took a two games to one lead in the four-game series.\n\n\"A great day, baby, a great day. Hey, man, I just squared up on some and it worked out,\" said Wynns during a post-game interview with Bally Sports Ohio.\n\nOf catcher Spiers, Wynn said, \"He mixed, he hit his spots, had good defense and we had timely hitting. Everything just played out from all our arsenals.\n\n\"The kid is nasty. Every one of his pitches set up another pitch. And he has come so far from spring training until now. I'm excited for him,\" Wynns added.\n\nThe Reds put it away in the fifth inning with six runs on only three hits. The highlight for the Reds was an error by St. Louis third baseman Nolan Arrenado, who has more Gold Gloves than fit on a large fireplace mantel.\n\nHe muffed a ground ball that would have ended the inning without a run.\n\nIt all began with a one-out triple into the right field corner by Elly De La Cruz, his ninth triple. Gray then walked Spencer Steer and he stole second.\n\nJake Fraley enacted a 10-pitch at bat fouling off four two-strike pitches before Gray hit him with a pitch to fill the bases.\n\nNoelvi Marte grounded to Arenado, an easy inning-ending double play. He gloved it, then dropped it. Everybody was safe as De La Cruz scored to make it 3-1.\n\nThat ended Gray's very gray day, replaced by John King.\n\nAfter pinch-hitter Santiago Espinal lined to shortstop for the second out, Stuart Fairchild drilled a two-run single to left for a 5-1 lead. Fairchild stole second and Will Benson rolled a two-run single to right and it was 7-1.\n\nWynns doubled past Arenado for the sixth run of the inning and an 8-1 lead.\n\nUnbelievably, India made two outs in the inning, but he already had doubled in the third inning to extend his hitting streak to 11 games that includes 12 extra base hits.\n\nAnd it was the seventh straight game in which he produced a double, a club record. Then he doubled again in the seventh, his eighth straight multi-hit game.\n\nWynns began a two-run Reds third inning with a double and was doubled home by India. De La Cruz made it three straight doubles and the Reds led, 2-0. Wynns poked his third double in the seventh and scored on India's second double for a 9-2 lead.\n\nThe Reds had six doubles in Thursday's 11-4 win over the Cardinals and added seven more Saturday.\n\nWynns caught all nine innings, finishing with a drenched uniform in the stifling humidity and heat in Busch Stadium, the world's largest sauna.\n\n\"It's a mindset, \"he said. \"A mindset. Prepare, hydrate ... that's all you can do, know what I mean.\"\n\nAnd what the Reds can do Sunday afternoon is win a series, something they haven't been able to do much of this season.", "source":

The Pirates won the second game of the series, 9-5. / Sam Greene/The Enquirer / USA TODAY\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds throttled the St. Louis Cardinals 11-4 on Thursday night at Busch Stadium. With the win, the Reds are trying to get back into the playoff race at 38-43. The Cardinals, who have been hot lately, dropped to 41-39.\n\nIt was a big game for the Reds, who welcomed back top prospect Noelvi Marte from his 80-game PED suspension. He went 3-for-5 in his season debut and could provide some much-needed firepower to the offense.\n\nFurthermore, Elly De La Cruz went 3-for-5 with a triple and a stolen base. As a result of his big night, he found himself in the midst of a great list in team history.\n\nDe La Cruz has the most stolen bases in all of baseball, but his pace has actually cooled. He was on a 100-stolen base pace earlier this season but as his bat petered off, so did his chances to take bags. That said, he's still on pace for nearly 80 stolen bases this year.\n\nDe La Cruz is hitting .255 while posting an .816 OPS. He's got 14 homers, 36 RBI and the 38 steals.\n\nThe Reds and Cardinals will play again on Friday night with first pitch coming at 8:15 p.m. ET.\n\nFrankie Montas (CIN) pitches against Andre Pallante (STL).", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Ball_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great American Ball Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cincinnati_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Cincinnati Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Busch Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Pallante", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre Pallante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Montas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frankie Montas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7586,h_4267,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastball/01j1fjdr8h8h40ccafrd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

I like that pressure. I definitely feel good at the top.\"\n\nIf he's feeling pressure, imagine how the rest of the Reds hitters must feel.\n\nIf Friday's fifth shutout of the short-handed, inconsistent Reds lineup this season showed anything, it's that India can't do it by himself. And that Noelvi Marte's return from a steroid suspension isn't a magic bullet for this team. And maybe that there isn't enough hitting in the vicinity to cash in on all those playoff plans this team had - at lead not enough margin to play down as many hitters as they did the last two games.\n\nCatcher Tyler Stephenson left Thursday and is on the paternity list to be with his wife and newborn.

Email: jwilliams@enquirer.com\n\nMessage: When will you and the other Enquirer writers take off the kid gloves and begin being critically objective about the job that David Bell has done since he's been the manager of the Reds. He is mediocre at best, but you and your colleagues don't criticize him the way that he needs to be criticized concerning his handling of the Reds. Case in point is Will Benson. He's not even hitting his weight, but David Bell says he will come around in due time. Benson has talent for sure, but he does not need to be playing in Cincinnati.\n\nReply: Sounds like your criticism is more about what Bell says or doesn't say. Sounds like you're tired of the constant rah-rah messages Bell delivers to the media each day as the losses mount.\n\nYou may not like his approach, but Bell is being true to who he is. He prides himself on being a supportive player's manager. He believes it's the best way to get the most out of a young clubhouse. He's not a phony. He believes in the young core of this team to his core.\n\nNoelvi Marte returns: Reds won't wait for results to activate third baseman after steroid suspension\n\nWittenmyer & Williams What'll take for Reds to overcome bad baserunning?\n\nBell's approach also is in lockstep with what his boss, team president Nick Krall, wants - an emphasis on team chemistry and positive reinforcement. It's what Bell and Krall believe will help develop the Reds into a consistent winner.\n\nWere you complaining about Bell's approach at this time last year, when all those young guys were just coming up, tearing it up and turning the Reds into a surprise contender? He was saying the same things then.\n\nThere certainly are times when you'd like for Bell to be a little more critical in his assessment of the team's struggles. It's OK to be positive, and say you still believe in a slumping player and sputtering team. But there's nothing wrong with a little reality check.\n\nSomething like this, for example: We believe in Benson. We still see him as a big part of our future. He's putting in extra work, and we love that about him. But we can't keep playing him if this keeps up. He knows that. We know that.\n\nBell, in his sixth season as Reds manager, talks a lot about process. That's another thing fans don't want to hear. That'll happen when a franchise hasn't won a playoff series since Bill Clinton was in his first term.\n\nLike it or not, it is a process when you're developing a young team - especially one that's been plagued by a rash of injuries. Fans clamored for the Reds to establish a plan and stick to it. They finally have a plan, and they're trying to make it work.\n\nElly De La Cruz just passed the one-year mark since his big-league debut. Matt McLain, Noelvi Marte and Christian Encarnacion-Strand haven't played a full season in the majors yet. Nick Lodolo hasn't pitched a full healthy season.\n\nThere will come a time when these players aren't young anymore, and Bell's messages may not resonate. Dare I say, trust the process. Or don't trust the process. Either way, the Reds' plan needs more time.\n\nIf it becomes obvious the plan isn't working and we're still getting the same messages from Bell, then it'll be time to take the kid gloves off.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bell_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Bell (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Williams_(basketball,_born_1975)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jason Williams (basketball, born 1975)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Benson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Benson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cincinnati_Enquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Cincinnati Enquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Krall", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Krall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockstep_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockstep (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reinforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player-coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Player-coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Lodolo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Lodolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_McLain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt McLain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/q.Ll2pcv9SEwj.ftNn_9zQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cincinnati-com-the-enquirer/edcae766d63e9b90f27be758ef2d7fc2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

In his three starts since then, he held opponents to four runs on 10 hits in 21 2/3 innings.\n\nHe struck out 21 during that span and walked only three.\n\n\"He's a guy that if he says it, he's going to do it. That's what he's showing,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"He said he wanted to be on the attack.\"\n\nGray said mechanical adjustments also contributed to his turnaround.\n\n\"There's also kind of what I'm trying to do with the baseball ... is a little bit of a shift as well,\" Gray said. \"I'm not trying to manipulate it as much with certain things. And yet, I know that's when I'm at my best is when I do go in with that mindset. I'm just going to continue down this road and not let it get away from me this time.\"\n\nGray, who pitched for the Reds for three seasons, didn't face Cincinnati when the teams played earlier this season.

He struck out 10 and walked two.\n\nSpiers earned his first big-league victory while meeting the quality start metric against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday. He allowed three runs on seven hits in six innings while striking out five and walking one.\n\nEstablishing good command early was the key to that performance.\n\n\"Coming out of the gate, getting in the zone, mixing well early, that was kind of a big thing for me to get me settled in,\" Spiers said.\n\nHe is 0-1 with a 6.00 ERA in two career appearances against the Cardinals, including one start.\n\nThe Reds' offense has been bolstered in this series by the return of Noelvi Marte from his 80-game PED suspension.\n\n\"He's a hell of a player, hell of a talent,\" said Reds second baseman Jonathan India, who extended his hitting streak to 10 games on Friday. \"He's coming out swinging like he usually does. It's big for this lineup.\"\n\nThe Cardinals made a bullpen adjustment Friday, promoting Gordon Graceffo for his first big-league look and sending Kyle Leahy to Memphis to make room for him.\n\nReds outfielder Jake Fraley was out of the starting lineup again Friday with a calf contusion. \"We just have to be a little careful with him so it doesn't turn into anything like a muscle strain,\" Reds manager David Bell said\n\nAlso missing Friday were catcher Tyler Stephenson, who is away from the team on paternity leave, and third baseman Jeimer Candelario, who is battling knee

Goldschmidt's 11th home run of the season was one of just two extra-base hits for the Cardinals.\n\nMatt Carpenter (2 for 4) doubled and scored a run, while Michael Siani went 1 for 3 with an RBI. Nolan Arenado (2 for 4) also had a multi-hit game, and Nolan Gorman (1 for 3) walked and drove in a run.\n\nCardinals pitcher Sonny Gray (9-5) allowed six runs (three earned runs) on seven hits and one walk in 4 1/3 innings.

Still, the 2023 Reds finished with a winning record, 82-80, after losing 100 games the previous season.\n\nWith Thursday's victory in St. Louis, the 2024 version of the Reds reached the halfway point at 38-43 and in fourth place in the NL Central. Though they're 10 games behind the Milwaukee Brewers, the Reds are just 3 1/2 games back in the wild-card hunt.\n\nAt the halfway point, it's a good time to take a look at what the first half held for this Reds team and what it could mean going forward.\n\nThe Reds entered spring training with high hopes -- the polar opposite of the year before. Though far from a favorite to win the NL Central, the Reds were expected to challenge for the top spot.\n\nThe reasoning was sound. The Reds had good, young talent throughout the roster.\n\nHowever, as spring training went on, the Reds continued to lose players. First, it was a suspension to Noelvi Marte, among the favorites for the Rookie of the Year race going into the season, then injuries to the projected No. 1 and No. 2 batters in the order, TJ Friedl and Matt McLain. Not only were those two players atop the lineup, but also two middle-of-the-field lynchpins.\n\nFriedl is currently on his third injured-list stint and has played in just 26 games. McLain hasn't played and it seems unlikely he'll play this season, even though the team is holding out some help. Marte missed the first 80 games due to a suspension and his three hits in his first game -- extending his hitting streak that began last season to 17 games -- showed what the Reds missed in his absence.\n\nThe biggest positive of the season has been the steps forward made by three of the team's top-end young talents, shortstop Elly De La Cruz and starters Hunter Greene and Nick Lodolo.\n\nLike Friedl, Lodolo is on the IL for the third time this season. However, he's already made five more starts this season than the seven he made in 2023. Lodolo, who went on the IL earlier this week because of a blister on his left index finger, is 8-3 with a 2.96 ERA, with the Reds winning nine of his 12 starts. Even in his last outing before going on the IL, he couldn't throw his best pitch -- his breaking ball -- but still put the Reds in a position to win, allowing three earned runs in 4 2/3 innings. Until he does it, staying healthy will be a question for Lodolo, but each of his first two IL stays was short.\n\nGreene's on-again, off-again search for a third pitch is showing some progress with his splitter. Greene is 5-3 with a 3.79 ERA in 16 starts.\n\nAnd then there's De La Cruz. Because De La Cruz's talent is so obvious, there's often a focus on what he isn't doing well as opposed to what he is doing well.\n\nIn 98 games last season, De La Cruz posted a 0.8 bWAR and is already at 2.7 bWAR this season.\n\nDe La Cruz led baseball with 106 strikeouts entering the Reds' 82nd game of the season. That's the bad, at least on the surface.\n\nDe La Cruz is going to strike out, but he's hardly alone in that department. Strikeouts are part of the modern game, and despite all the recent rule changes, strikeouts still count as only one out. Even if his 30.6 percent strikeout percentage is high, it's 3.1 points lower than it was in his rookie year. He's also seen his walk rate improve at nearly the same rate, from 8.2 percent last season to 11 percent this year.\n\nOne of the biggest changes has been De La Cruz's swing decisions, something he said was an offseason focus. After putting up a chase percentage -- the rate of swings at pitches outside the strike zone -- of 32.8 percent as a rookie, it's at just 24.7 percent this year. That may not sound like much, but he's gone from the 24th percentile to the 71st percentile in that category.\n\nWhen De La Cruz does hit the ball, he's seen his ground-ball rate go from 55.3 percent to 48.5 percent.\n\nDe La Cruz's batting average as a rookie was .235 and was at .255 heading into Friday. But he's also seen his on-base percentage improve from .300 to .346 and his slugging has gone from .410 to .470.\n\nThose successes have helped him have three more steals this year than he did all of last season in 17 fewer games. He's also topped his home run total with 14 through 81 games against 13 a year ago.\n\nHe's also taken a step forward batting from the right side, hitting .243/.355/.379 this season. A year ago, he hit .184/.231/.263 as a right-handed hitter.\n\nLast year De La Cruz had 13 errors at shortstop on 277 chances. This year he has 15 in 325 chances, a similar rate as a year ago.\n\nAs for advanced fielding metrics, Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) has him at minus-4, but Statcast's Outs Above Average has him at 7 and his fielding run value is in the 91st percentile. All advanced metrics have their positive and negatives, but by examining them as a whole, you can see that it's not easy to pigeonhole someone as a \"good\" or \"bad\" fielder by those metrics alone. It's undeniable that De La Cruz has an elite arm and range.\n\nIt's never a guarantee that a young player will improve in their second year, but so far De La Cruz has done that in many different areas of his game.\n\nIn addition to McLain and Friedl starting the season on the injured list, another of the team's heralded youngsters, Christian Encarnacion-Strand, started slowly and then suffered a fracture in his wrist that will require surgery.\n\nEncarnacion-Strand played in 29 games and hit just .190/.220/.293.\n\nJeimer Candelario has also been hobbled recently, just as his bat started heating up. Injuries have kept Jake Fraley out of the lineup. The Reds' outfield of Stuart Fairchild, Levi Jordan and Nick Martini looked more like one you'd expect at a road game in spring training than the lineup for a rubber match against a division foe.\n\nOutfielder Will Benson started slowly in 2023, but after a demotion to Triple A, he came back and hit .298/.389/.542 over the final 98 games of the season. Now, because of the issues with the team's outfield, the Reds simply don't have the bodies on the roster to send him down. Benson is hitting just .194/.285/.378 in 75 games.\n\nOn the pitching side, all but three pitchers have an ERA+ better than 100. However, each of those three came into the season with high expectations: starters Frankie Montas (95) and Graham Ashcraft (78), and closer Alexis D\u00edaz (87).\n\nMarte's back, which is good news. However, between now and the trade deadline, the Reds will have to decide where they stand.\n\nThe state of the National League makes that decision even more difficult., with 13 out of the 15 teams within four games of a playoff spot.\n\nEspecially the year after the Arizona Diamondbacks edged the Reds for the final playoff spot and then went to the World Series, it's difficult to wave the white flag. That said, because there are so few sellers at this point, the Reds could find that the low supply of teams looking to sell should mean those players on the market could offer a tempting return.\n\nThe playoff race should clear up a little in the next month, but straddling the line between buyer and seller may go down to the wire.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_trent_rosecrans@nytimes.com", "name": "C.

Alec Burleson's pop up served as a sacrifice fly and drove in the game's only run.\n\nCardinals starting pitcher Andre Pallante (4-3) pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings, allowed four hits and three walks.

The Cardinals three-headed relief pitching monster of JoJo Romero, Andrew Kittredge and Ryan Helsley all contributed to shutting the door in the final two innings with the slimmest of margins for error.\n\nIn the eighth inning, the fleet footed De La Cruz walked against Romero, stole second base and then tagged up and advanced to third base to put the tying run 90 feet away.\n\nWith the right-handed hitting slugger Noelvi Marte up with two outs, Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol turned to Kittredge for the righty-righty matchup. Kittredge struck out Marte, swinging, on three pitches and stranded De La Cruz at third base.\n\nHelsley retired the side in order in the ninth, but left fielder Brendan Donovan made a leaping catch at the wall on a ball hit by Stuart Fairchild to record the final out of the game. Helsley registered his 29th consecutive save. His 29 saves lead MLB.\n\nPallante's track record against the Reds\n\nPallante hadn't pitched in a game since he started against the San Francisco Giants at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama, on June 20.\n\nPallante entered Friday night's game having won each of his four previous career decisions against the Reds (4-0) in 13 total appearances. He'd compiled an ERA of 1.55 against the Reds in his career.\n\nPallante began this season in the Cardinals' bullpen, but he went down to the minors and stretched out as a starting pitcher. He's started since he returned to the majors. His first start since the 2022 season came against the Reds in Cincinnati on May 29. He pitched six scoreless innings and allowed three hits and three walks to get the win.\n\nIn three previous career starts against the Reds, he'd posted a 1.65 ERA against the Reds.\n\nEntering the night, Pallante had appeared in 123 career games in the majors and he'd posted a career ERA of 4.01.\n\nManufacturing a lead\n\nThe Cardinals took a 1-0 lead in the third inning after a leadoff double ripped off the right field wall by Siani. The double came off Siani's bat with an exit velocity of 104.1 mph.\n\nSiani then advanced to third base on a grounder to the right side of the infield by Donovan. That put a runner on third with just one out.\n\nWillson Contreras walked to give the Cardinals two base runners with just one out, and that brought Burleson to the plate.\n\nBurleson, who'd fouled off six pitches from Reds starting pitcher Frankie Montas in his first-inning plate appearance, hit a fly ball to shallow center field. De La Cruz, the Reds shortstop, drifted backward and made the catch while drifting in the outfield.\n\nSiani tagged up and scored on the play with De La Cruz's throw to the plate off his back foot tailing slightly up the third base line before it ricocheted away from catcher Luke Maile. The errant throw allowed Contreras to advance to second base.\n\nA potentially pivotal frame for Pallante\n\nPallante stranded the bases loaded to preserve the one-run lead in the fifth inning.\n\nThe Reds put two men on with one out after Will Benson walked and Stuart Fairchild swatted a bloop single into right field.\n\nPallante got Maile to fly out to shallow center field after Maile failed to get down a bunt attempt. That left two men on with two outs.\n\nReds leadoff hitter Jonathan India, who had hits in each of his previous two at-bats in the game against Pallante, drew a walk to load the bases. That set up a matchup between Pallante and the switch-hitting De La Cruz.\n\nPallante came into the night having held left-handed hitters to a .185 batting average this season. De La Cruz grounded to first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, who flipped to Pallante covering first base for the third out of the inning.\n\nFernandez and Donovan get assists in the sixth\n\nPallante put the first two batters of the sixth inning on base when he hit Spencer Steer with a pitch and then walked Nick Martini.\n\nPallante got the last batter he faced, Marte, to hit a soft fly ball down the left field line that Brendan Donovan caught for the first out of the inning.\n\nRookie reliever Ryan Fernandez, who pitched in the ninth inning on Thursday night, then entered the game with two men on and one out.\n\nThe first batter Fernandez faced, Santiago Espinal, hit a deep drive to the warning track in left field. The ball tailed away from Donovan, but the former Gold Glove winner (as a utility player) made a leaping catch on the run just in front of the wall headed toward the left field corner.\n\nDonovan's catch was the second out of the inning, and Fernandez struck out Will Benson to strand both of the inherited runners on base and keep the one-run lead.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lynn_worthy@stltoday.com", "name": "Lynn Worthy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Helsley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Helsley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kittredge", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Kittredge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Janet Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Pallante", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andre Pallante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Burleson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alec Burleson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_running", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base running"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown St. Louis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Busch Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindenwood_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lindenwood University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo_Romero", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JoJo Romero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Marmol", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Marmol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._Romero", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

They'd seemingly been playing nail-biter games for the past month. After all, 15 of their previous 25 games had been decided by a margin of two runs or fewer.\n\nThose sorts of white-knuckle affairs had become the norm as of late. Things were following a similar script going into the fifth inning on Saturday afternoon.\n\nHowever, the Cardinals couldn't hold the line. Instead of taking it down to the final out locked in a staring contest and trying to make the other side blink first, the Cardinals slipped up and watched the Cincinnati Reds put up a six-run inning -- much of it at the expense of Cardinals ace pitcher Sonny Gray.\n\nThe fifth inning put the game out of reach and set the Cardinals on the path to a 9-4 loss to the Reds in front of an announced crowd of 39,164 at Busch Stadium.\n\nJanet Jackson, with Nelly opener, mostly wows crowd at Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre Acclaimed St. Louis restaurant Bulrush closes.

I didn't feel like I was in a ton of those counts. They worked deep at-bats, took some good swings, spoiled a lot of pitches with some foul balls and kind of put the ball in play.\"\n\nGray threw 92 pitches to get through 4 1/3 innings. He allowed six runs (three earned runs) on seven hits, including four extra-base hits, and one walk. Gray (9-5) also struck out five.\n\nGray, who pitched for the Reds from 2019-2021, entered the day coming off arguably his best three-start stretch of the season.\n\nGray allowed four runs on 10 hits and just three walks in his previous three starts (21 2/3 innings). He struck out 21 batters during that stretch, held opposing hitters to a .139 batting average and posted a 1.66 ERA. He pitched at least seven innings in each of those three outings.\n\nOn Saturday against the Reds, Gray felt like he didn't necessarily get rewarded even when he'd \"beat\" batters by making the pitch he wanted.\n\nThe Reds (39-44) scored two runs on a string of three consecutive doubles in the third inning.\n\nCatcher Austin Wynns started the frame with a double down the line to the opposite field that went into the right field corner on a sinker Gray left up in the zone but on the inner half of the plate.\n\nThen Jonathan India, the Reds' leadoff hitter, worked the count from 1-2 to 3-2 and hooked a cutter away and pulled it down the left field line for a double that bounced over the side wall and into the stands. India became the first player in Reds history to double in seven consecutive games. Wynns scored the game's first run on India's double.\n\nThen Reds dynamic shortstop Elly De La Cruz hit a 3-2 sweeper on the outer half of the plate the opposite way for an RBI double.\n\nThe Cardinals (42-40) cut the two-run deficit in half in the bottom of the third after Matt Carpenter (2 for 4) doubled and scored on a Michael Siani RBI single.\n\nThe score stayed 2-1 going into the fifth inning.\n\nCardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado (2 for 4) made an outstanding play, reading the hop perfectly while on the move to his left, and threw out India to start the fifth inning.\n\nThen De La Cruz tripled on the first pitch of the next at-bat -- a down and in cutter -- on a ball lined into the right field corner.\n\nThe next batter, Reds slugger Spencer Steer, walked on five pitches. After Steer stole second base to stay out of the double play possibility, Jake Fraley fouled off four 3-2 pitches before Gray hit Fraley with a pitch.\n\nGray's sinker that veered up and in and hit Fraley marked his 88th pitch of the game.\n\nGray threw four more pitches, and he got Noelvi Marte to hit a grounder to third base.\n\n\"You're trying to make close pitches early,\" Gray said of the Steer walk. \"That's kind of like an unintentional intentional kind of walk there to get to Fraley. Then (Fraley) just put together a really, really, really good at-bat. I made like pitch after pitch after pitch, then tried to bring one back and it stayed in there and hit him -- which wasn't the end of the world, knowing you had Marte coming up.\n\n\"I just wanted to attack (Marte), so I attacked him with fastballs. I was wanting to force contact on the ground. I went for the strikeout once I got to 0-2. Got to 1-2, and still went for the strikeout but also went for something on the ground again. I kind of brought it back closer. He hit a groundball. It kind of looked like it took a funny little hop or something.\"\n\nArenado couldn't field Marte's groundball cleanly. The grounder that initially appeared a candidate for an inning-ending double play, instead became an error by Arenado that allowed the Reds to score their third run of the day without an out recorded on the play.\n\n\"When you look at it, I think he's in control,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said of Gray's fifth inning. \"I think he made his pitch. I trust Nolan to make that play every time.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it kicked up a little bit off the heel and we don't turn it. But I think when you look at what Sonny did, he settled in and made the pitch to get the groundball there. He's either going to go for the chase or try to get something on the ground there, and he did exactly that.\"\n\nGray exited the game with one run having scored on the error and the bases loaded with one out in the fifth inning. At that point, the score was still 3-1.\n\n\"I felt like I was OK,\" Gray said of his pitch execution. \"I definitely wasn't sharp by any means. For the most part, I thought I made fine pitches. They did put the ball in play. It just didn't go our way.\n\n\"Once that fifth inning went the way it does, it kind of felt like -- after Marte's at-bat -- it kind of felt like the momentum was completely on their side. We were kind of flirting with it at the time. It kind of went to their side and that inning kind of just escalated on us.\"\n\nReliever John King got Nick Martini to line out to Winn at shortstop for the second out of the inning, but the Reds reeled off back-to-back two-run singles by Stuart Fairchild and Will Benson. The Benson single deflected off of the glove of the second baseman, Gorman, and caromed into center field.\n\nWynns doubled on a grounder down the third base line that Arenado got his glove on, but couldn't scoop up. The double drove in the sixth run of the inning and ended the outing for King.\n\nTwo of the runs scored in the inning were charged to King, while the other four were charged to Gray.\n\nThe Cardinals hitters were held to just three hits through the first six innings, including a solo home run by first baseman Paul Goldschmidt (1 for 4) in the sixth. They added runs in the seventh and eighth innings.\n\nRookie right-hander Gordon Graceffo, a pitching prospect called up from the minors for the first time on Friday, made his major-league debut in relief. Graceffo allowed one run on three hits and two walks in 4 1/3 innings. He struck out four.\n\n\"It definitely gives you a lot of confidence,\" Graceffo said. \"You want to know that your stuff plays here, and that's what I was trying to do. I was trying to put everything in the zone and attack these guys and show them what I'm about. I think I did a good job of that.\"\n\nGraceffo's innings were important in that they kept an already weary bullpen from having to carry the burden of covering the entire 4 2/3 innings remaining after Gray's exit.\n\n\"We needed it,\" Marmol said of Graceffo's outing. \"That's why he's here, to pick up innings like the ones he did today and for us to stay away from the rest of our pen and keep those guys fresh for tomorrow.\n\n\"Our guys, if I'm being quite honest, are on fumes. We need to dig deep, figure out a way to win tomorrow and then get to that off day and regroup and get back at it.\"\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St.

Cincinnati Reds finding trouble finishing what they start in series", "body": "Bob Nightengale and Steve Gardner talk about who the big buyers in the MLB trade market are this season, and what players they are considering.\n\nST. LOUIS - When the Cincinnati Reds won their series opener in a rout of the Cardinals on Thursday, one Cincinnati press box wag suggested it was the kiss of death for the Reds the rest of the four-gamer at Busch Stadium.\n\nNo?\n\nIt was the fourth time in the last five series the Reds lineup put up a robust performance in a series opener to win - only to follow each with a loss on the way to losing the series.\n\n\"We've been doing this the last four series,\" torrid-hitting leadoff man Jonathan India said. \"Win big the first game, and it doesn't turn out great the next. We've got to keep our foot on the pedal here.\"\n\nDon't look now, but here they go again.\n\nSeriously, don't look. You wouldn't find any runs anyway as the Reds followed an 11-run output with a 1-0 loss Friday.\n\n\"Yeah, it sucks,\" said India, who nonetheless reached base three times Friday and delivered two of the Reds' four hits. \"Not a great feeling. We keep doing the same thing.\n\n\"But we've got two more,\" said India, who's 11-for-17 (.647) with four walks and seven doubles in five games since replacing injured TJ Friedl at the top of the order. \"We can still win a series. Got to find a way.\"\n\nThis would be the seventh straight series for the Reds without winning one (splitting a two-gamer with Cleveland along the way).\n\n\"We take the same approach every day,\" manager David Bell said of the perplexing recent pattern. \"That's going to correct itself. It's going to even itself out, and more.\"", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_India", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Busch Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TJ_Friedl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TJ Friedl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bell_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Bell (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Symbian", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Symbian", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Railroad_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Railroad Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Web", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Web", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/28/PCIN/74240911007-usatsi-23637789.jpg?auto=webp&crop=6358,3578,x0,y331&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

LOUIS -- Cardinals center fielder Michael Siani tagged up and scored from third base on a ball caught by Cincinnati Reds shortstop Elly De La Cruz in shallow center field, and that aggressive base running maneuver provided the margin of victory in a pitchers' duel between NL Central Division rivals.\n\nSiani's run accounted for the entirety of the scoring in the game as the Cardinals logged a 1-0 win over the Reds in front of an announced crowd of 40,220 in the second game of a four-game series at Busch Stadium on Friday night.\n\nThe Cardinals (42-39) shut out an opponent for the fourth time this season.\n\nSiani went 1 for 3 with the Cardinals' lone extra-base hit. Alec Burleson's popup served as a sacrifice fly and drove in the game's only run.\n\nCardinals starting pitcher Andre Pallante (4-3) pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings, allowed four hits and three walks. He also struck out five to earn the win.\n\nRookie reliever Ryan Fernandez pitched 1 2/3 innings and didn't allow a batter to reach base. The Cardinals three-headed relief pitching monster of JoJo Romero, Andrew Kittredge and Ryan Helsley all contributed to shutting the door in the final two innings with the slimmest of margins for error.\n\nIn the eighth inning, the fleet footed De La Cruz walked against Romero, stole second base and then tagged up and advanced to third base to put the tying run 90 feet away.\n\nWith the right-handed hitting slugger Noelvi Marte up with two outs, Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol turned to Kittredge for the righty-righty matchup. Kittredge struck out Marte, swinging, on three pitches and stranded De La Cruz at third base.\n\nHelsley retired the side in order in the ninth, but left fielder Brendan Donovan made a leaping catch at the wall on a ball hit by Stuart Fairchild to record the final out of the game. Helsley's 29 saves lead MLB.\n\nPallante's track record against the Reds\n\nPallante hadn't pitched in a game since he started against the San Francisco Giants at Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Ala., on June 20.\n\nPallante entered Friday night's game having won each of his four previous career decisions against the Reds (4-0) in 13 total appearances. He'd compiled an ERA of 1.55 against the Reds in his career.\n\nPallante began this season in the Cardinals' bullpen, but he went down to the minors and stretched out as a starting pitcher. He's started since he returned to the majors. His first start since the 2022 season came against the Reds in Cincinnati on May 29. He pitched six scoreless innings and allowed three hits and three walks to get the win.\n\nIn three previous career starts against the Reds, he'd posted a 1.65 ERA.\n\nEntering the night, Pallante had appeared in 123 career games in the majors and he'd posted a career ERA of 4.01.\n\nManufacturing a lead\n\nThe Cardinals took a 1-0 lead in the third inning after a leadoff double ripped off the right-field wall by Siani. The double came off Siani's bat with an exit velocity of 104.1 mph.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nSiani then advanced to third base on a grounder to the right side of the infield by Donovan. That put a runner on third with just one out.\n\nWillson Contreras walked to give the Cardinals two base runners with just one out, and that brought Burleson to the plate.\n\nBurleson, who'd fouled off six pitches from Reds starting pitcher Frankie Montas in his first-inning plate appearance, hit a fly ball to shallow center field. De La Cruz, the Reds shortstop, drifted backward and made the catch in the outfield.\n\nSiani tagged up and scored on the play with De La Cruz's throw to the plate off his back foot tailing slightly up the third base line before it ricocheted away from catcher Luke Maile. The errant throw allowed Contreras to advance to second base.\n\nA potentially pivotal frame for Pallante\n\nPallante stranded the bases loaded to preserve the one-run lead in the fifth inning.\n\nThe Reds put two men on with one out after Will Benson walked and Stuart Fairchild swatted a bloop single into right field.\n\nPallante got Maile to fly out to shallow center field after Maile failed to get down a bunt attempt. That left two men on with two outs.\n\nReds leadoff hitter Jonathan India, who had hits in each of his previous two at-bats in the game against Pallante, drew a walk to load the bases. That set up a matchup between Pallante and the switch-hitting De La Cruz.\n\nPallante came into the night having held left-handed hitters to a .185 batting average this season. De La Cruz grounded to first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, who flipped to Pallante covering first base for the third out of the inning.\n\nFernandez and Donovan get assists in the sixth\n\nPallante put the first two batters of the sixth inning on base when he hit Spencer Steer with a pitch and then walked Nick Martini.\n\nPallante got the last batter he faced, Marte, to hit a soft fly ball down the left-field line that Brendan Donovan caught for the first out of the inning.\n\nRookie reliever Ryan Fernandez, who pitched in the ninth inning on Thursday night, then entered the game with two men on and one out.\n\nThe first batter Fernandez faced, Santiago Espinal, hit a deep drive to the warning track in left field. The ball tailed away from Donovan, but the former Gold Glove winner (as a utility player) made a leaping catch on the run just in front of the wall headed toward the left field corner.\n\nDonovan's catch was the second out of the inning, and Fernandez struck out Will Benson to strand both of the inherited runners on base and keep the one-run lead.\n\n\u00a92024 STLtoday.com.

Our MLB odds series has our Reds-Cardinals prediction, odds, and pick for Friday.\n\nThe Reds make the trip to St. Louis to face the Cardinals! These two teams have been having similar seasons with neither being able to find any consistency. The Cardinals are playing better while the Reds are spiraling. Our MLB odds series has our Reds-Cardinals prediction, odds, and pick for Friday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched six innings and gave up two runs on five hits with one walk and four strikeouts in a Reds loss.\n\nLast Start: Pitched 5.1 innings and gave up five runs on seven hits with three walks and five strikeouts in a Cardinals win.\n\nThe Reds have struggled to find consistency and have a 37-43. They have lost four out of their last five games and two straight leading into this game. Cincinnati has struggled to get going behind the plate, ranking near the bottom of the MLB. Their pitching has been red-hot and is just outside the top 10 of the MLB. Spencer Steer, Elly De La Cruz, Will Benson, Jeimer Candelario, and Jake Fraley have been standouts in a struggling offense this season. Andrew Abbott, Hunter Greene, and Nick Lodolo have all been at varying levels of good for Cincinnati on the mound. The Reds have had their fair share of struggles this season, and can't find any consistency.\n\nThe Reds are starting Frankie Montas on the mound where he has a 3-5 record, a 4.48 ERA, and a 1.36 WHIP. Through 66.1 innings, he has allowed 37 runs on 63 hits with 27 walks and 53 strikeouts up to this point in the season. In his 14 starts, the Reds are 4-10 this season. Montas has struggled this season, but it might not matter with the Cardinals' offense being below average.\n\nThe Reds have struggled behind the plate this season. They are ranked 27th in batting average at .228 after they finished with a .249 batting average just one season ago. Elly De La Cruz, Jonathan India, Jeimer Candelario, and Spencer Steer lead in most batting categories. India leads in batting average at .268 and in OBP at .376. De la Cruz and Candelario are tied for the lead in home runs at 14 and De La Cruz leads in total hits at 74. Finally, Steer leads in RBI at 49. The Reds might not have any issues with Andre Pallante struggling and getting the nod for the Cardinals on the mound.\n\nWhy The Cardinals Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Cardinals have been inconsistent this season, but they have a winning record of 41-38. They have won five out of their last six games. The Cardinals have been below average with their bats and then just outside the top 10 in pitching this season. Brendan Donovan, Nolan Arenado, Paul Goldschmidt, and Willson Contreras have at least tried to stand out on a bad offense. On the mound, Kyle Gibson, Lance Lynn, and Sonny Gray have been solid for a unit that has struggled this season.\n\nThe Cardinals are starting Andre Pallante on the mound, where he has a 3-3 record, a 5.23 ERA, and a 1.62 WHIP up to this point in the season. Through 32.2 innings, he has allowed 21 runs on 38 hits with 15 walks and 26 strikeouts. In his 14 appearances this season, the Cardinals have gone 4-10. Pallante has been inconsistent whether he has been a starter or when he has come in out of the bullpen in relief. That might not matter much because the Reds have struggled behind the plate.\n\nThe offense for the Cardinals has struggled this season. They are 17th in team-batting average at .240 after finishing last season with a .250 batting average by comparison. Masynn Winn, Nolan Gorman, and Brendan Donovan lead the way for the Cardinals in most batting categories. Winn leads in batting average at .292 and then Gorman leads the way in home runs at 16. Finally, Donovan leads in RBI at 40, in OBP at .337, and in total hits at 78. The Cardinals offense has an interesting matchup against Frankie Montas where both have been inconsistent this season.\n\nFinal Reds-Cardinals Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Reds are struggling more than the Cardinals leading into this matchup. The Reds have a slight advantage at pitcher with Montas over Pallante. The Cardinals are the better offense and the hotter team. The Cardinals should keep this close and cover and potentially win this game at home.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news",

He walked three batters and walked four.\n\nThe right-hander is 4-0 with a 1.55 ERA in 13 career appearances against the Reds, including three starts. He gets another chance against them at home on Friday in the second game in a four-game series.\n\nThe Reds racked up 16 hits while routing the Cardinals 11-4 on Thursday in the opener.\n\n\"They had some really good at-bats,\" Marmol said, \"so throw this one out.\"\n\nMarmol originally planned to schedule a bullpen start for Friday to give his rotation an extra day of rest. When the rainout forced the Cardinals and Atlanta Braves to play a doubleheader on Wednesday, Marmol decided to start Matthew Liberatore in Game 2 and bump Pallante back two days.\n\nPallante is 3-2 with a 4.76 ERA in five starts this season after converting from his relief role to fill in for injured starter Steven Matz. He earned a 6-5 victory over the San Francisco Giants in his latest start, allowing five runs on seven hits and three walks in 5 1/3 innings on June 20.\n\nSince Matz is at least a month away from returning from his back injury, Pallante and Liberatore will compete for the fifth starter role. Liberatore made his case by throwing six shutout innings against the Braves.\n\nThe Reds will counter Pallante with Frankie Montas (3-5, 4.48 ERA), who was on the losing end on May 29 against Pallante and the Cardinals. He allowed three runs on six hits, including a Matt Carpenter homer, in six innings.\n\nMontas struck out five and walked two in that game. He is 0-1 with a 9.00 ERA in two career starts vs. St. Louis.\n\nIn his latest start, Montas held the Boston Red Sox to two runs on five hits in six innings on Saturday. He struck out four and walked one in a game Cincinnati eventually lost 4-3.\n\n\"He threw tons of strikes with all of his pitches,\" Reds manager David Bell said. \"If he continues to do that, with his stuff, he's got a lot of success ahead.\"\n\nReds infielder Jeimer Candelario was out of the lineup for the second game in a row on Thursday. He was diagnosed with hamstring tendinitis that is contributing to knee soreness.\n\nThat nagging issue made the Thursday return of third baseman Noelvi Marte from his 80-game, performance-enhancing-drug suspension more important. Marte went 3-for-5 with a stolen base, three runs and an RBI in his season debut.\n\n\"The talent Noelvi is, the player we've seen already, that's why it's so important for Noelvi to be himself, go out and play hard and work to get better every day,\" Bell said. \"Everything else is going to take care of itself. The production and the performance will be there.\"\n\nReds catcher Tyler Stephenson was a late scratch from the Thursday game after his wife went into labor. He headed out on paternity leave.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@sacbee.com",

He allowed three runs in that opening frame and six overall while completing just four innings during a 9-5 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nGreene (5-3, 3.79 ERA) will try to rebound in the finale of a four-game series Sunday at Busch Stadium. The Reds won 11-4 Thursday and 9-4 on Saturday while the Cardinals won 1-0 Friday.\n\nBecoming ill two batters into that start presented a unique challenge for Greene.\n\n\"It's going to throw you off,\" Greene said. \"Mentally, you're going to be thinking about that a little bit more than making pitches. You just try to do your best I guess in that situation, in that mindset, and focus on what you need to do. It's not easy, but I wasn't coming out of that game and knew I wasn't. I had to try and make do with it.\"\n\nPrior to that loss, Greene was 5-0 with a 2.80 ERA during a span of 10 starts.\n\n\"I think Hunter has been so good for us,\" Reds manager David Bell said. \"He kind of needs to just put this one behind him.\"\n\nGreene did not face the Cardinals when the teams met in May. He is 1-3 with a 3.79 ERA in seven career starts against them.\n\nWhile Greene is coming off his most difficult start, Cardinals starter Lance Lynn (3-3, 3.86) is coming off one of his best.\n\nThe right-hander held the Atlanta Braves to one run on four hits in 6 2/3 innings in a 4-2 victory Monday. He struck out five and walked nobody while earning his first victory since May 21.\n\n\"Throughout the season you are going to go through times where you throw the ball well and you're going to have bad luck, things don't go your way,\" Lynn said after that game. \"But I've been fine-tuning, Dusty (Blake) and the pitching coaches and I have been working on some stuff. Tonight everything finally clicked.\n\n\"Hopefully for myself, it starts things rolling where I could do some things.\"\n\nLynn suffered a 3-1 loss to the Reds on May 27. He allowed three runs (one earned) on five hits in six innings. He walked three and struck out five.\n\nIn his career Lynn is 12-5 with a 3.20 ERA in 23 career appearances against the Reds, including 20 starts.\n\nLynn will need to pay particular attention to Cincinnati leadoff hitter Jonathan India, who is one of baseball's hottest hitters.\n\nIndia extended his hitting streak to 11 games with two doubles Saturday.

We're not saying it tops \"for sale: baby shoes, never worn,\" but \"Santiago Espinal, designated hitter\" is also an awfully sad story and is two entire words shorter. The Cincinnati lineup tonight was a product of the Reds keeping Jeimer Candelario and Jake Fraley in injury limbo for the third straight game; neither could even DH tonight, but the Reds still didn't want to commit to IL stints.

Through Friday he was hitting .252 with a .345 on-base percentage and team-leading .810 OPS.", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Run_Derby_(Major_League_Baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home Run Derby (Major League Baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Boras", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott Boras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeimer_Candelario", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeimer Candelario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/28/PCIN/74240914007-usatsi-23637945.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4466,2513,x0,y232&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

LOUIS - The Cincinnati Reds might be starting to shed a well-earned reputation from early this season of not being able to beat good pitching.\n\nNow they just have to prove they can do more than streak-hit and occasionally take advantage of other teams' mistakes to win more games than they lose. And then maybe even prove they're capable of contending for a playoff spot in a mediocre National League field.\n\nWinning two out of the first three games of a four-game series in St. Louis is arguably a start as they crossed the halfway mark of the season, the Reds routing the Cards 9-4 on Saturday two days after pounding St. Louis 11-4.\n\nThe Reds had 29 combined hits in the two blowouts - started by Cards veterans Miles Mikolas and former Red Sonny Gray - including 13 doubles, two triples and a home run.\n\nIn beating Gray, the three-time All-Star, on Saturday, the Reds added to a list of victories over staff aces that includes the Phillies' Zack Wheeler, Giants' Logan Webb, Dodgers' Tyler Glasnow, Cubs' Justin Steele and Brewers' Freddy Peralta.\n\nThey're still looking for back-to-back wins for the first time in two weeks as Hunter Greene takes the mound Sunday against Lance Lynn. And they're still five games under .500 - and a lot closer to last place than first.\n\nBut the Reds' suddenly born-again lineup - led by NL Player of the Week frontrunner Jonathan India - has given the Reds a much different look heading into July than they had during a miserable May that might yet prove their demise this season.\n\nSaturday's win, on the strength of a six-run fifth inning, assured a winning June after that 9-18 May.\n\nCan they keep it up? In between the two big scoring binges, the Reds went 13 innings from the end of Thursday through the first two innings Saturday without a run. So stay tuned.\n\nIndia, pressed into full-time leadoff duty when TJ Friedl (hamstring) landed on the injured list Monday for the third time this season, already was hot before reeling off six straight multi-hit games since then.\n\nHe's 13-for-22 (.591) in that stretch with four walks, nine doubles and was hit by a pitch (1.667 OPS).\n\nHis seven consecutive games with a double is a franchise record - and two short of Bo Bichette's big-league record.\n\nRookie Carson Spiers pitched well again to earn a second consecutive win, going six innings and allowing just one earned run, on Paul Goldschmidt's two-out solo home run in the sixth - after retiring 11 of 12.", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I think that's when I kind of get into a groove and things kind of start rolling. Changeups were working really good early and then spotted some cutters up and fastballs up so it worked out.\"\n\nFollowing the game, Reds manager David Bell praised Spiers, saying the 6-foot-3, 205-pounder \"just keeps getting better.\"\n\n\"He has four different pitches that he can throw at any time,\" Bell said, via Bally Sports Cincinnati. \"He locates all the pitches. He's even making great pitches with his fourth-best pitch, and that makes it tough. We know he can have a lot of success that way.\"\n\nSpiers' latest outing Saturday comes on the heels of his first MLB win this past Monday, when he allowed three runs and seven hits with five strikeouts and one walk in the Reds' 11-5 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati.\n\nIn eight games for the Reds so far this season (three starts), Spiers has posted a 3.13 ERA and 1.15 WHIP with 29 strikeouts and only seven walks over 37.1 innings pitched.\n\nSpiers made his Major League debut last season, when he appeared in four games (two starts) for the Reds and logged 13 innings pitched. He threw three scoreless innings and allowed just one hit en route to recording his first big-league save on Sept. 29, 2023, against the St. Louis Cardinals in St. Louis.\n\nThe 26-year-old signed a free agent contract with the Reds back in June 2020 following his Clemson career (2017-20), when he had a 7-7 record, 19 saves and a 2.47 ERA while allowing 70 hits (.180 opponents' batting average) and 38 walks with 103 strikeouts in 109.1 innings pitched over 71 relief appearances.\n\n-Photo courtesy of Jeff Le-USA TODAY Sports", "source": {"uri": "theclemsoninsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Clemson Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gavin_oliver@theclemsoninsider.com", "name": "Gavin Oliver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Busch Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clemson_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clemson University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Ball_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great American Ball Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://theclemsoninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2024/06/USATSI_23648291.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 2005, "textEnd": 2014}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

LOUIS (AP) -- Ryan Helsley closed for his major league-leading 29th consecutive save and Alec Burleson drove in the lone run, leading the St. Louis Cardinals to a 1-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Friday night.\n\nHelsley pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning. Left fielder Brendan Donovan made a leaping catch in front of the wall in left to end the game.\n\nHelsley hasn't blown a save since March 30, his first outing of the season against the Dodgers in Los Angeles. Helsley did earn the victory in that game.\n\nWith one more save, Helsley will tie the 30 saves that Hall of Famer Lee Smith posted in 1993 before the MLB All-Star Game, a Cardinals record.\n\nAndre Pallante (4-3) pitched 5 1/3 scoreless innings, checking the Reds on four hits. He struck out five while, walked three and hit a batter.\n\nPallante wriggled out of a two-out bases-loaded jam in the fifth by getting Elly De La Cruz to ground out.\n\nFrankie Montas (3-6), who signed as a free agent in the offseason, allowed one run on two hits in six innings.\n\nThe Cardinals scored on a sacrifice fly by Burleson in the third inning. Michael Siani led off with a double and took third on a ground out.\n\nTRANSACTIONS\n\nReds: Selected C Austin Wynns from Triple A-Louisville. They also placed C Tyler Stephenson on the paternity list, and designated OF Peyton Burdick for assignment.\n\nCardinals: Called up RHP Gordon Graceffo, the team's No. 8 prospect and a fifth-round pick in 2021, from Triple-A Memphis. He was 8-5 with a 3.84 ERA in 14 starts. ... Optioned RHP Kyle Leahy to Memphis.\n\nTRAINERS ROOM\n\nReds: OF Jake Fraley (right calf contusion) and 3B Jeimer Candelario (hamstring tendinitis) each missed their third straight game. Neither player is expected to require an IL stint.\n\nCardinals: OF Lars Nootbaar (oblique strain) began a rehab assignment at Double-A Springfield on Friday. He was hurt May 29.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCardinals RHP Sonny Gray (9-4, 2.81) was set to start Saturday against RHP Carson Spiers (1-1, 3.45).\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

So far, a young Reds team has been unable to build on last season's success.\n\nThe Reds are 38-43 -- putting them 10 games back in the NL Central and 3.5 games behind in the National League Wild Card race. Cincy is in a difficult position at the trade deadline as it decides whether to push for the postseason or stay patient with its young squad and wait until next year. With so much to consider, here are four Reds players who will be on the trade block ahead of the 2024 MLB trade deadline.\n\nJeimer Candelario (3B/1B)\n\nA trade deadline acquisition for the Chicago Cubs last year, Jeimer Candelario jumped to division rivals the Cincinnati Reds in free agency and has continued to swing the bat well. The corner infielder's .480 slugging leads the club, and his 14 homers are also tied for a team-best.\n\nUnfortunately for Candelario, his performance at the plate has not helped the Reds win many games this year. Candelario is in the first season of a three-year, $45 million deal with a club option for a fourth year. The Reds will be reluctant to trade him, but Jeimer Candelario will provide a good haul for a team unlikely to make the playoffs in 2024.\n\nFrankie Montas (SP)\n\nLike Candelario, Frankie Montas is another high-priced free agent (one-year, $16 million deal with a $20 million option for a second season) who was supposed to mold the Reds into a playoff contender.\n\nMontas pitched just 41 Major League innings over the last two years and has struggled to find his stride in 2024. The 31-year-old has a 4.48 ERA while ranking in the bottom third in the league in strikeout and walk rates. Frankie Montas would not be a flashy acquisition for a contending team, but he is a former Cy Young candidate who would be a solid fourth starter on a team needing an arm.\n\nBrent Suter (RP)\n\nAfter a solid seven-year tenure with the Milwaukee Brewers, Brent Suter has remained a dependable left-handed option out of the bullpen. Suter had a 3.38 ERA last year for the Rockies -- the best on the club -- and continues to carry a sub-4.00 ERA with the Reds in 2024. Only once in his nine-year career has the lefty finished the season with an ERA above 4.00, an invaluable level of consistency in the bullpen.\n\nSuter will not strike many guys out, but he is posting his lowest post-COVID walk rate and ranks among the best in the league in limiting hard contact. Brent Suter could be an under-the-radar acquisition at the MLB trade deadline.\n\nNick Martinez (RP/SP)\n\nDo you need a lockdown reliever whose performances are much better than his cursory numbers suggest? Look no further than Nick Martinez. Cincy tried Martinez in a starting role early in the year, but it did not work. The right-hander had a 7.36 ERA in five starts, going 0-3 in those contests. Since switching into a relief role, Martinz has been dominant. The 33-year-old has a 1.87 ERA in 33.2 innings as a reliever, including 12 outings of four outs or more. His 4.25 ERA is a bit off-putting, but Martinez carries a 2.93 expected ERA, suggesting more improvement in the season's second half.\n\nTeams could look to trade for Martinez, landing him at a discount and moving him back into a starting role. It is more likely clubs will look at him as a flexible reliever who can piggyback openers or start to handle more high-leverage situations. Either way, Nick Martinez is a valuable arm that the Reds will likely try to trade ahead of the deadline.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_hanley@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Liam Hanley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeimer_Candelario", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeimer Candelario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Montas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frankie Montas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Suter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brent Suter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading Cards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Reds-who-must-be-on-trade-block-ahead-of-2024-deadline.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9689293", "eventUri": "eng-9689293", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

It only takes one team. I don\u2019t care where that team is, it can be No. 1 or 58 \u2014 [but] I do care about the plan, the development. The team\u2019s strategy, the opportunity and the financial commitment. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not doing a two-way deal. Every team understands that,\u201d Bronny James\u2019 agent Rich Paul told ESPN. A two-way contract is usually offered to second-round and undrafted prospects. It limits players to four days on the NBA roster with the player having to spend the rest of the season in the G-League, the lower division. Each NBA team has three two-way contracts in addition to 15 regular roster spots. Recent reports indicate that Bronny will be practising with the Phoenix Suns and LA Lakers as part of their team workouts with both teams feigning interest in the 19-year-old guard. LeBron has already stated that he would love to play with his son and with \u2018The King\u2019 running out of contract, he could decline his $51.4 million player option for 2024-25 and enter free agency. Whichever team lands Bronny could see one of the greatest of all time join them as well. \u2013IANS aaa/bsk", "summary": "<p>New Delhi, May 29 (IANS) Bronny James, son of the NBA\u2019s all-time leading top scorer LeBron James, will be foregoing his college eligibility to stay in the NBA Draft according&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/bronny-james-to-forego-college-eligibility-and-stay-in-the-nba-draft/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Bronny James to forego college eligibility and stay in the NBA draft</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/bronny-james-to-forego-college-eligibility-and-stay-in-the-nba-draft/\">Bronny James to forego college eligibility and stay in the NBA draft</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/bronny-james-to-forego-college-eligibility-and-stay-in-the-nba-draft/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202405293168378.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:19:33", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": -0.076}

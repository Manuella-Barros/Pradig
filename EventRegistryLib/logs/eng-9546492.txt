(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nA new California bill would prohibit grocery or retail drug stores from offering self-checkout options to customers unless they comply with certain conditions, such as capping purchases at 10 items.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 1446, retailers will be allowed to assign one employee to monitor two self-service checkout stations. The employee must be relieved from all other duties.\n\nThe bill, proposed by Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas (D-Dist. 28), requires that establishments have at least one manual checkout station manned by one employee who is available to assist customers.\n\nPurchases at self-service checkouts would be limited to 10 items or fewer, with signage indicating this. Customers would be prohibited from using self-service checkouts to buy certain items such as alcohol and tobacco products.\n\nThe legislation also requires that stores offering self-service checkout include this technology in their analysis of potential workplace hazards for injury and illness.\n\n\"We must protect jobs and ensure worker safety,\" Ms. Smallwood-Cuevas said, according to ABC7 News.\n\nThe bill will require stores intending to install the technology to conduct a study that includes the salaries, benefits, jobs, and work hours that would be eliminated.\n\nStores will need to notify and solicit input from employees at least 60 days before drafting the study, and they must provide the study to employees or their collective bargaining representatives at least 60 days before implementing the technology.\n\nThe Western States Council, which represents unionized workers in California, Arizona, and Nevada, has backed the bill, saying it will \"increase staffing and oversight at self-checkout machines\" and help prevent theft and promote safety.\n\n\"Ensuring stores are adequately staffed will protect workers, prevent retail theft, and improve the customer experience. That's why #SB1446 is a win for our communities,\" the council stated on X.\n\nHowever, the California Grocers Association (CGA) has argued that the proposed law would \"severely disrupt\" the grocery checkout experience and called on people to oppose it.\n\n\"Grocery shoppers enjoy self-checkout for its convenience, yet SB 1446 by Sen. Smallwood-Cuevas proposes to make self-checkout anything but,\" the CGA stated on its website.\n\nThe bill would \"significantly impact the future of technological innovation in California retail by requiring a worker and consumer assessment of any technology deployed in stores that could impact jobs,\" it stated.\n\n\"Let's keep decisions about the grocery store checkout experience, technology upgrades, and employee operations in the hands of those who know their stores best: grocers, not politicians,\" the CGA added.\n\nMany retailers, including grocery stores, added self-checkout options during the COVID-19 pandemic to lessen personal touch. They kept them in place because it helped cut back on the cost of hiring cashiers.\n\nAccording to the National Retail Federation (NRF), retail theft reached $121.6 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $150 billion by 2026.\n\nThis could be one reason that stores owned by Walmart, Target, and Dollar General have announced that their reliance on self-checkout will shift dramatically for the rest of 2024.\n\n\"We've found that 25 percent of their losses are happening through self-checkouts, and they're now looking at how to effectively address those issues,\" Adrian Beck, an emeritus professor with the School of Criminology at the University of Leicester, United Kingdom, told The Epoch Times last month.\n\n\"Around 53 percent of the loss was malicious and purposeful, but there was also a huge chunk of non-malicious theft where people just make mistakes,\" he added.\n\nMr. Beck's report, titled \"Global Study on Self-Checkout,\" said that theft was identified as a problem with the technology as early as 2022.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-checkout", "type": "wiki",

These conditions include self-checkouts limited to 10 items or less, at least one manual staffed checkout station available, customers prohibited from purchasing certain items, employees only allowed to monitor up to two self-service stations, and employees relieved from all other duties while monitoring.\n\nIn addition, SB 1446 would require a grocery establishment or retail drug establishment that offers self-service checkout to include it in a specified analysis of potential work hazards for purposes of their injury and illness prevention programs.\n\nThe bill would require a grocery or drug store that develops or implements technology that significantly affects the essential job functions or eliminates jobs or essential job functions of its employees, or that enables self-service, to complete a specified assessment before implementing the technology.\n\nSenator Smallwood-Cuevas authored the bill to protect grocery and drug store jobs from the growing number of self-checkout counters, as well as protect against retail theft because of the nature of self-checkout lines.\n\n\"We must protect jobs and ensure worker safety,\" said Senator Smallwood-Cuevas recently. \"1446 is essential to making sure that we are addressing all of the complexity of this issue of retail theft and most importantly putting workers and consumers first.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, she also said, \"Inclusivity is at the center of this legislative effort - demonstrating that California is a state where every person and community has the support, protections and resources needed to thrive.\"\n\nA polarizing bill\n\nSince being introduced in February, SB 1446 has proved polarizing. Labor unions including United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), and Legal Groups including Prosecutors Alliance of California have been supportive of the bill because of it's focus on protecting jobs and allegedly fighting against retail theft.\n\n\"The hope is that we can reduce the amount of theft that happens. That's a much better solution than punishing theft after it occurs,\" said executive director of the Prosecutors Alliance of California Cristine Soto DeBerry. \"There's data on this that shows there is stuff that happens at self-checkouts. One of the main deterrents from theft is that there are staff paying attention in the store to your activities.\"\n\nHowever, retail groups and business associations oppose the bill. The California Chamber of Commerce argues that the bill will dramatically increase staffing at stores, which will leads to more money being lost at stores, longer lines, reduced hours, or even store closures because of the narrow profit-margins those stores make. They also charge that the bill's author is using retail theft as a way to bloat stores hiring people.\n\nIn a statement, the California Chamber of Commerce said that \"Customers love self-checkout for its convenience, but SB 1446 would add barriers to make it anything but - restricting what shoppers can purchase through self-checkout and forcing grocers to overstaff the area. Although the bill claims to reduce retail theft, it would have the exact opposite effect, undermining a grocers' ability to defend itself by disallowing locked items like razors from being eligible for purchase via self-checkout. In this way, SB 1446 attempts to take advantage of California's very real concern about retail theft while actually hurting customers and grocers.\"\n\nAshley Hoffman, senior policy advocate at CalChamber, added, \"In part it's codifying some requirements that I think, from our perspective, are a little heavy-handed, as far as getting down into the granularity of how business or a store needs to operate. For example, the grocery space, where they're operating on pretty thin margins. You know, when you're having to make these drastic adjustments or adjust staffing ratios, that can be a big cost impact.\"\n\nIn the past few weeks, the polarization has only grown even more. A 4-1 vote in the Senate Labor, Public Employment, and Retirement Committee in Mid-April sparked more groups to take sides. Retail stores are hesitant to hire more people as self-checkout counters have reduced employees and brought in faster check-out times, while studies have also shown that self-check out counters have actually increased retail theft.\n\n\"Either way, retailers lose on this bill,\" retail legal advisor William Friedlander told the Globe on Monday. \"If this passes, stores will greatly reduce the number of self-checkouts. That means less retail theft, but yeah, also long lines and stores having to hire a ton of more workers. If it doesn't pass, self-checkouts are saved as is, but retail thefts continue.\"\n\n\"The solution behind all this would be to change around Proposition 47, lower that $950 felony amount to the average that stores lose in retail theft, and bring back justice that way. That's honestly the overarching way to fix this. But it is, and instead we have SB 1446 giving a 'Damned if you do, damned if you don't' ultimatum. And yeah, we have seen both sides really put more resources into this recently for that reason. But no one wants to bring up the reason why all this is happening, Prop. 47. The author should have focused on that instead.\"\n\nSB 1446 is to go before the Senate Appropriations Committee soon.\n\nAuthor Recent Posts Evan SymonEvan V.

Although the bill claims to reduce retail theft, it would have the exact opposite effect, undermining a grocers' ability to defend itself by disallowing locked items like razors from being eligible for purchase via self-checkout.

But they're also a magnet for theft and, as losses for retail stores pile up, California may try to do something about it.\n\nSenate Bill 1446, introduced by California State Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas, would remove most self-serve kiosks at large grocery and drug stores, forcing companies to hire more workers. The bill would set certain conditions for self-service stations, including utilizing \"no more than two self-service checkout stations that can be monitored by any one employee and the employee has to be relieved of all other duties,\" according to Fox News.\n\nSome experts believe that the bill would result in a move away from cutting costs by cutting labor. Critics say the bill would impose more unnecessary regulations on stores that are already cutting back on self-serve kiosks. Indeed, this is a transparent attempt to boost hiring at grocery and drug stores at a time when they're already being killed by rising union labor costs.\n\nSmallwood-Cuevas says that her bill would also protect employees who find themselves facing thieves alone. \"As self-checkout has become more commonplace, lone workers have become easy targets for theft and violence as they are forced to stock merchandise, operate checkout stations, and cater to customers\" all while \"trying to monitor their stores for retail theft,\" Smallwood-Cuevas said.\n\nUSA Today:\n\nSB 1446 would prohibit grocery and retail drug stores from offering self-checkout services unless:\n\nLast month, Walmart said it was scaling back its self-service options, as did Target.

Costco said shrink had increased in 2023 \"in part we believe due to the rollout of self-checkout.\"\n\nAnother approach is adding a receipt-scanning gate at self-checkout areas, which Safeway has done at multiple locations in California, in addition to shutting down self-checkout entirely in some stores.\n\nIt's just too easy to steal at self-checkout unless stores are hyper-vigilant about checking items on the receipt against items in the bag. Then there's the lack of service at self-service stations, with one person covering four or five individual kiosks. This is especially inconvenient when questioning a price or having a scanned item display an error code.\n\nMost people live with the inconvenience because it beats standing in line if you only have a few items to buy.

Grocers and retailers would also be required to assess the impact of using technology that could eliminate jobs or significantly affect essential job functions.\n\nSmallwood-Cuevas cited that self-checkout machines cause 16 times more losses compared to check-outs with a cashier, which raises concerns about the safety of employees as theft continues to increase in the industry. Major retailers like Walmart and Five Below have already begun scaling back on self-checkout machines to combat theft and ensure employee safety.\n\nThe bill aims to address the vulnerability of lone workers who are targets for theft and violence while juggling multiple tasks in the store.

What a California bill would mean.", "body": "A proposed bill in California could lead to fewer self-checkout kiosks in the Golden State.\n\nSenate Bill 1446, part of a bill package introduced by California State Senator Lola Smallwood-Cuevas in February, would require many large grocery and drug retail stores to staff up their self-checkout stations.\n\nExperts say the bill could result in more stores moving away from the technology, which aims to reduce labor costs.\n\nThe proposed mandates come as retailers continue to voice concerns about shrinkage - an industry term for missing inventory from theft, broken items and other factors.\n\nThe bill's goal, according to testimony from Smallwood-Cuevas in a hearing earlier this year, is to reduce retail theft while also adding jobs and protecting workers and shoppers.\n\nCritics say the bill would impose unnecessary regulations on stores that are already starting to limit or scale back their use of self-checkout.\n\nWhat does the bill say?\n\nSB 1446 would prohibit grocery and retail drug stores from offering self-checkout services unless:\n\nIt would also require stores to complete a worker and consumer impact assessment before implementing certain technologies, including artificial intelligence.\n\nProponents say the bill, supported by the United Food And Commercial Workers union, would create jobs while alleviating retail theft in California.\n\nIn a 2022 survey from the ECR Retail Loss Group, 93 global retailers estimated that self-checkout systems accounted for as much as 23% of their total unknown store losses. Two-thirds said losses from self-checkout were becoming more of a problem.\n\nBut opponents say it would impose unnecessary, one-size-fits-all restrictions on retailers.\n\n\"These measures will only serve to frustrate consumers with no evidence that they will reduce theft or provide additional protection to employees,\" said Margaret Gladstein, speaking for the California Retailers Association at an April hearing.\n\nA number of organizations are instead pushing for harsher punishments for those caught stealing from retailers. A proposed California ballot initiative would allow the state to increase criminal penalties for people who repeatedly steal. The initiative has received funding from retailers like Walmart, Target and Home Depot.\n\nImpact on shoppers\n\nWhile proponents of SB 1446 say the new rules would save companies money by reducing theft, California retailers may be more inclined to pull out their self-checkout machines than pay for the additional labor required under the mandates.\n\n\"I suspect there'll be some reductions in self-checkouts,\" said Ron Larson, a visiting associate professor of economics at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, who has researched self-checkout. \"If the stores thought that changing the ratio, adding more people (to self-checkout lanes) would be cost-effective, they would have already done it.\"\n\nAnd Larson warned that the companies that decide to staff up would see labor costs rise, which could lead to companies passing down higher prices to consumers.\n\nThe state of self-checkout\n\nSome stores have already started to roll back their use of self-checkout in recent months to boost customer service and reduce losses from customers stealing or making mistakes at the scanner.\n\nWalmart is taking out self-checkout kiosks in certain stores. Target has limited self-checkout lanes to 10 items or fewer. Dollar General is converting its self-checkout registers to assisted-checkout options in most stores; the remaining self-checkout devices will be available only to shoppers with five items or fewer.\n\nDollar General CEO Todd Vasos said during a March earnings call that reducing self-checkout has the potential to have a \"material and positive impact\" on the loss of goods.\n\nSelf-checkout: The downsides of the technology and why retailers aren't expected to pull them out anytime soon\n\nBut the recent shift among retailers isn't necessarily signaling the end of self-checkout. Instead, retailers are entering a \"new era\" as they switch up their policies and tech, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of the analytics company GlobalData.\n\n\"Retailers test things, try things,\" Saunders said. \"Sometimes they don't work. Sometimes they change in the implementation, and retailers adapt with them,\" he added. \"I don't think it signals the complete disappearance of self-checkout.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-checkout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Self-checkout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoplifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shoplifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiosk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiosk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Home_Depot", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Home Depot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_College_(Iowa)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luther College (Iowa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_General", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dollar General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorah,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decorah, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Decorah, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Associations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Services", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Consulting", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Education and Training", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1jXlDG96yTae1Y3_dNL2bw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_money_325/d2ac648922353609a1e4cdfc4158259f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546492", "eventUri": "eng-9546492", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Now, California Democrats want to crack down on retail theft by proposing new legislation that would largely prevent grocery and some retail stores from using self-checkout lines. Instead of addressing some of the root causes of crimes like these, such as the passage of two controversial ballot initiatives -- Propositions 47 and 57 in 2013 and 2016, respectively -- California Democrats want to double down on their \"nanny-state\" policies and attack business, instead of the criminals that victimize them.\n\nSenate Bill 1446, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Lola Smallwood-Cuevas, would \"prohibit a grocery or retail drug establishment from providing a self-service checkout option for customers unless specified conditions are met,\" according to the bill. Some of the conditions of the proposed legislation would allow self-checkout lines if there was an employee dedicated to observing no more than two self-checkout machines, and the employee cannot be required to do anything else while observing the machines. Smallwood-Cuevas defended her legislation, saying that self-checkout lines are a major driving factor in monetary loss for grocery and retail stores. According to Smallwood-Cuevas, $10 billion in losses can be attributed to these machines annually, and they cause 16 times more losses than regular checkout lines.\n\nSmallwood-Cuevas is misleading you, however, by using the billions in losses number, she wants you to believe that self-checkouts are the main driver behind retail theft. The losses amount to approximately 3.5 percent of annual losses for retail stores, which is over 16 times more than regular cashiers. Indeed, that is a large number by any metric, however, some factors are being ignored here. For instance, when shoplifters come into the stores, either by themselves or in large groups, the goal of the suspect(s) is to obtain as much property as they can and immediately head for the exits to escape. They are either completely bypassing the checkout lines, whether they are self-checkout or not, or they simply walk by them without attempting to stop and even pretend as if they are using them. losses generated from a self-checkout machine are almost exclusively from people paying for some items and skipping others.\n\nAt self-checkout units, partial shrink is [...] where a shopper pays for some of their purchase, but not the full amount. For example, a shopper might have three cans of soda but only scan two of them, or might type in a code for a lower-priced item.\n\nIn California, criminals have been emboldened by the onslaught of Democratic soft-on-crime laws, causing retail theft losses to steadily climb higher every year since at least 2016. Since propositions 47 and 57 were passed by the voters, incidents like these have become commonplace, and for good reason. When these laws required the reduction of non-violent felonies such as burglary and theft to misdemeanors, the light bulb on criminals' heads went on. One law in particular that was gutted by Prop 47 was a section in the California penal code (666 P.C.) that made petty theft with prior convictions a felony. When I was working patrol as a deputy sheriff, this section was hugely effective in removing shoplifters and thieves from the streets. The responses from some suspects, both first-time and repeat offenders, were of pure shock when they found out about getting charged with a felony and possibly going to prison.\n\nPeople are stealing from stores because they know that with policies such as no-cash bail, deferred prosecutions, and dropped charges for first-time offenders, there will be little to no consequences for stealing, and they can easily make money off the stolen items when they turn around and sell them for cash. There is no incentive for criminals to stop, rather it is the opposite; why wouldn't they steal? Criminals also know that laws are being put into place that hamstring store employees from attempting to stop them from stealing, which makes an exit without even attempting to buy one item that much easier.\n\nNow, with this new legislation being proposed, the Democrats will have simply removed a potential \"roadblock\" from the exit path of a would-be thief. Smallwood-Cuevas is using the reliable \"Daddy government\" to hamper what private businesses do in their stores rather than using common sense to reconsider and repeal some of the very laws she helped put in place that benefited the criminal. The soft-on-crime approach has to end, but Democrats like Smallwood-Cuevas refuse to listen and double down on their failed soft-on-crime policies.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_funicello@redstate.com", "name": "Matt Funicello", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-checkout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Self-checkout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoplifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shoplifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lola_Smallwood-Cuevas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lola Smallwood-Cuevas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recidivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incandescent light bulb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2011/269/a5524be1-2abb-4c74-9972-10db2a2b49dd@news.ap.org.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546492", "eventUri": "eng-9546492", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The bill in question would mandate that employees who supervise self-checkout be working for only that reason, meaning that they could not perform any other functions when they are tasked with supervising.\n\nIt would also mandate that employees can supervise only two self-checkouts, meaning that if your local Walmart or Target has eight such stations (as mine do), the store would have to have four people working in that station who can do nothing else on the clock other than watch the stations.\n\nThis bill would supposedly serve two purposes, one being to supposedly \"create\" jobs that automation would eliminate, when in reality this would just encourage stores to shut down self-checkout stations rather than employ useless workers.

For one, the stores themselves can already decide to put extra employees at self-checkout or shut down those stations if they want to address thefts.

The second problem, of course, is that this would be California Democrats again ducking the reality that state law is too soft on shoplifters. Rather than strengthen criminal penalties, the state wants to scapegoat self-checkout stations.\n\nThis would be yet another perfect example of California's legislative incompetence. The state makes it onerous to employ people with high taxes and regulations, then with a one-size-fits-all mandate cracks down on automation that it is inadvertently incentivizing businesses to adopt, and tries to paint it as a jobs program and crime policy while ignoring actual crime policy.

That's what I was doing recently when shopping for two items in a nearby store.\n\nI noticed a new sign had been posted: \"Self-check-out restricted to 15 items or less.\" I had not seen that before.\n\nOn the contrary, there were times I had stood in self-checkout lines when the regular cashier stations were all closed or only had one checker. People had large carts full of items. Fresh foods, paper goods, canned goods, liquor or wine or beer, you name it.\n\nThe sign made me wonder what prompted the change. Scanning, bagging, and paying complete, I headed over to the long-time cashier, Margarita, who was supervising the area.\n\nAfter her usual warm welcome and \"I've missed seeing you lately\" greeting, I asked about the sign. She told me a story of self-checkout that is also playing out nationally.\n\nTheft is a problem, she said, with some customers who intentionally skip scanning expensive products. Some have figured out how to scan in cheaper prices. The more items the more likely the theft.\n\nSelf-checkout began early in the last century. The first Piggly Wiggly \"self-service supermarket\" was created in 1918. This was the beginning of putting customers to work for supermarkets without pay. From the start it was designed as a way to lower labor costs.\n\nAccording to CNN Business, the more robust effort came with the first modern system, called Check Reboot, piloted by Kroger in 1986. It's much different from what we see today; customers would scan items, someone would bag them, and then you would go to a central cashier to pay. (At least they were still doing the bagging!)\n\nA decade later Walmart began to test the system, and in the 2000s they expanded it, as did Albertson's and others that were cutting costs in the 2001 recession.\n\nThe premise was this: Self-checkout would lower wait times, eliminate labor costs and revolutionize the grocery industry. Machines don't call in sick, and they always show up.\n\nIn 2020, Walmart began testing stores that were exclusively self-checkout. Machines and customers working for them.\n\nFast forward to 2024.\n\nA surprising shift occurred. In the fall of 2023, the retail giant removed all of its self-checkout machines in six U.S. stores. The Canadian company Giant Tiger and others began following suit.\n\nWhy?\n\nChristopher Andrews, author of \"The Overworked Consumer: Supermarkets and the Do-It-Yourself Economy,\" says, \"Self-checkout delivers none of what it promises.\"\n\nCustomers are not the most reliable scanners and make mistakes. And, by some reports, 67% of customers either dislike self-checkout or find it too frustrating. Some customers are thieves and don't scan expensive items. And, given the lax oversight, theft through self-checkout is high and costly.\n\nSelf-checkout still requires attendants to help customers and monitor theft, but monitoring theft can put employees in danger from aggressive thieves. Machine maintenance adds costs as it requires highly skilled IT expertise. Waits can be longer, not shorter, due to unpaid, untrained workers: customers like you and me.\n\nAnd, Andrews says, some stores have figured out that due to theft, self-checkout actually hurts the bottom line.\n\nThere is little question that some form of self-checkout is here to stay. After 40 years you would think it would be flawless, but it's not. And from a customer point of view, it's sorely lacking in customer service.", "source": {"uri": "ladailypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LosAlamos Daily Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-checkout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Self-checkout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piggly_Wiggly", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piggly Wiggly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertsons", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Albertsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroger", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kroger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Tiger", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giant Tiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546492", "eventUri": "eng-9546492", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

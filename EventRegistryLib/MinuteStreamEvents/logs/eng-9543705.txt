But on Monday, Thiero announced on social media that he'll instead follow Calipari and suit up for the Razorbacks in 2024-25.\n\nThiero elected to stick with his head coach of the last two years, choosing Arkansas over a group of finalists that also included North Carolina, Pittsburgh, Indiana, and a return to Kentucky. The 6-foot-8 wing took a visit to Pitt in late April before making a surprise trip to Arkansas last week.\n\n\"I started with Coach Cal and want to see it through with him,\" Thiero told ESPN. \"Very excited to join the family and ready to get to work.\"\n\nDuring the 2023-24 season at Kentucky, Thiero averaged 7.2 points, five rebounds, and one block in 21.4 minutes per game for the Wildcats while shooting 49.2 percent from the field.\n\nThiero's father, Almamy, played for Calipari back in the Memphis days, so there's a strong connection between Calipari and the Thiero family. That being said, the sense was that Thiero would look away from Kentucky and Calipari once he initially put his name into the portal. However, his familiarity with playing in Calipari's system and a desire to reach the NBA (he's a projected first-round pick in 2025) helped push him to Arkansas.\n\n\"(Calipari is) known for putting guys in the NBA that also stay in the NBA and coach Kenny Payne, who is now with him again, was also there for some of those years,\" Thiero said, per ESPN. \"After already playing for him and developing after two years, I feel that he knows my game and will put me in the right position to succeed and achieve my goals.\"\n\nThiero was an under-the-radar prospect out of high school as a low-end three-star recruit. But a significant growth spurt going into college saw his potential skyrocket. Thiero played limited minutes as a freshman at UK in 2022-23 (2.3 PPG in 9.5 MPG) before taking a leap in the offseason. He then started 19 of 25 games this past season despite dealing with various nagging injuries.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zack_geoghegan@on3.com", "name": "Zack Geoghegan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calipari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Calipari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Razorbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Razorbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pittsburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pittsburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Payne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Payne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/06132953/kentucky-transfer-adou-thiero-following-john-calipari-arkansas.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543705", "eventUri": "eng-9543705", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

Thiero played sporadically as a freshman, deputizing in a variety of roles for UK due to injuries and other player availability issues on that 2022-23 roster.\n\nLast season as a sophomore, Thiero was one of the best defensive players on the UK team and probably its most physical.\n\nHe started 19 of 25 games as a sophomore, missing eight games due to injury and a continued growth spurt. Thiero provided a physicality and toughness that was often praised by Calipari. He also brought a distinct blend of athleticism, size and skill to the court.\n\n\"My role -- I don't know. Once again, it changes every game,\" Thiero said in March about his role at UK. \"Sometimes I have to score. Sometimes it's just rebounding. Like the Tennessee game, I didn't really score. I just had a couple of rebounds and blocked shots. But I think if I can just bring energy -- always try and get offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, a couple of blocks, some steals -- if that's what I have to do for us to win, then I'll do that. I think I just gotta come in and play ... as hard as I can, and we should be in the right place.\"\n\nThiero averaged 7.2 points, 5 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.1 blocks as a sophomore at Kentucky.\n\nThiero entered the transfer portal while Calipari was still at his former post with UK. Thiero's father, Almamy, also played for Calipari when he was the coach at Memphis.\n\nThe Wildcats hired Mark Pope, the former head coach at BYU and Utah Valley and a key member of UK's 1996 NCAA championship team, to replace Calipari.", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_drummond@kentucky.com", "name":

Indiana and Kentucky were also in his top five schools.\n\nThings changed when John Calipari, who left Kentucky for Arkansas, hosted Thiero on a visit last week. Thiero's father, Almany Thiero, also played for Calipari during his time as head coach of Memphis.\n\nThiero played high school basketball for Quaker Valley in Leetsdale, Pa., about 18 miles northwest of Pitt's campus on the Ohio river.\n\nHe excelled throughout high school, but especially as a senior in 2022, where he scored 23.3 points, grabbed 10.3 rebounds, dished out 5.9 assists, forced 3.9 steals and made 2.3 blocks per game, respectively, en route to a WPIAL Class 4A Championship and finishing runners-up in the PIAA Playoffs.\n\nThiero, who ranked as a four-star in the Class of 2022, committed to Kentucky to Calipari, who is from western Pennsylvania himself.\n\nHe averaged 9.5 minutes, 2.3 points and 1.9 rebounds per game over 20 appearances as a freshman. Thiero improved this past season as a sophomore, appearing in 25 games, starting 19 and averaging 7.2 points, 5.0 rebounds 1.1 assists and 1.1 blocks per game, respectively, while shooting 49.2% from the field and 80.0% from the foul line.\n\nPitt lost a few of their forwards from last season, as First Team All-ACC star Blake Hinson graduated and both Federiko Federiko and Will Jeffress entered the transfer portal.\n\nThey did land Florida State transfer Cameron Corhen and will bring in freshman Amdy Ndiaye, as well as a heathly return for Papa Amadou Kante, who suffered a season-ending injury prior to last season and redshirted.\n\nPitt has brought in two transfers this season in Houston guard Damian Dunn committed back in April, along with Corhen.\n\nWhile the Panthers missed out on Thiero, it's likely they'll continue to work through the portal to add more talent this offseason.\n\nMake sure you bookmark Inside the Panthers for the latest news, exclusive interviews,

The Hogs have also landed three high school recruits who were previously pledged to Kentucky.\n\nMore: Johnell Davis commits to Arkansas basketball: What does FAU transfer bring to Razorbacks?\n\nMore: 'It's another level': What impact will John Calipari have on Arkansas basketball recruiting?\n\nAccording to The Athletic, Thiero ranks as the No. 60 transfer in this year's portal class. Here's a closer look at Thiero's decision to join Arkansas and his potential impact with the Razorbacks.\n\nIt might sound simple, but Thiero's calling card is consistent energy. The 6-foot-8 wing combines his elite athleticism with sustained intensity to make hustle plays and provide a foundational piece for Arkansas' defense. He can guard all five positions and brings maximum effort on the glass.\n\nOffensively, Thiero still needs some work. He shot 31.8% from three last season and according to The Athletic, Thiero made just 48% of his attempts around the rim. He needs to work on his touch both inside the paint and from beyond the three-point line, but Thiero's ceiling rises to another level if he can become a reliable player on the offensive end.\n\nThiero played in 45 games across two seasons with the Wildcats, with his minutes doubling as a sophomore. He averaged 7.2 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.1 blocks while playing a good portion of last season with an injured thumb.\n\nThiero had his best stretch of his career in early February when Kentucky was starting to turn the tide on its season. He scored 14 points and grabbed eight rebounds in a road upset over Auburn and reached double figures in scoring in three of the next five games.\n\nIt remains to be seen if he will be a locked-on starter, but Thiero bring needed versatility to the Hogs' front court. He could play the three and give Arkansas one of the biggest lineups in the country, or he could slide to the four against smaller teams where a more athletic front court is required.\n\nThe key to his role will be his offensive development. He started 19 games last season for a Kentucky team that needed his defensive intensity, but Calipari is putting together a much more balanced roster with the Hogs with talented defenders like Jonas Aidoo and Johnell Davis already in the fold. If Thiero can make an impact on offense, he will get a ton of minutes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Smith Times Record: What does Kentucky transfer Adou Thiero bring to Arkansas basketball?", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Razorbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Razorbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayetteville,_Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fayetteville, Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fayetteville, Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calipari", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Calipari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnell_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johnell Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Times_Record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Times Record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auburn University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XZ8YUg7n1ut9nNIbCQKeZw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MTk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ft-smith-southwest-times-record/eef5d5617b7ceb20f30f281d3e31cd1d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543705", "eventUri": "eng-9543705", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Thiero played sporadically as a freshman, deputizing in a variety of roles for UK due to injuries and other player availability issues on that 2022-23 roster.\n\nLast season as a sophomore, Thiero was one of the best defensive players on the UK team and probably its most physical.\n\nHe started 19 of 25 games as a sophomore, missing eight games due to injury and a continued growth spurt. Thiero provided a physicality and toughness that was often praised by Calipari. He also brought a distinct blend of athleticism, size and skill to the court.\n\n\"My role -- I don't know. Once again, it changes every game,\" Thiero said in March about his role at UK. \"Sometimes I have to score. Sometimes it's just rebounding. Like the Tennessee game, I didn't really score. I just had a couple of rebounds and blocked shots. But I think if I can just bring energy -- always try and get offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds, a couple of blocks, some steals -- if that's what I have to do for us to win, then I'll do that. I think I just gotta come in and play ... as hard as I can, and we should be in the right place.\"\n\nThiero averaged 7.2 points, 5 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.1 blocks as a sophomore at Kentucky.\n\nThiero entered the transfer portal while Calipari was still at his former post with UK. Thiero's father, Almamy, also played for Calipari when he was the coach at Memphis.\n\nThe Wildcats hired Mark Pope, the former head coach at BYU and Utah Valley and a key member of UK's 1996 NCAA championship team, to replace Calipari.\n\nStarting center from Big 12 is the latest transfer pickup for Mark Pope and UK basketball\n\nFormer Wake Forest forward Andrew Carr, after a career season, will transfer to UK basketball\n\nFormer Big 12 guard signs with Kentucky basketball from transfer portal\n\nKentucky basketball's Mark Pope lands starting guard from recent Final Four team\n\nWhat's Mark Pope looking for as he builds his first Kentucky roster?

Calipari has landed former FAU guard Johnell Davis, who is widely considered a Top 3 transfer. Former Tennessee center Jonas Aidoo committed to the Razorbacks as the No. 11 player in the portal.

Now, he'll be reuniting with Calipari in Fayetteville\n\nAs a sophomore at UK, he averaged 7.2 points and 5.0 rebounds in 21.4 minutes per game.\n\nThe Athletic's Sam Vecenie called Thiero \"one of the few Wildcats this year to consistently bring value on the defensive end.\"\n\n\"He rotated around the court with disruptive intent and attacked everything that went up on the glass,\" Vecenie wrote. \"On the offensive end, his impact was more limited, but he consistently did all of the little things required.\"\n\nIn terms of the team he inherited, Calipari told reporters during his introductory press conference he pretty much had a blank slate. So many players from the 2023-24 had either graduated, declared for the 2024 NBA draft, or entered the portal.\n\nThat raised the question of how many underclassmen and 2024 recruits Coach Cal might be able to poach from his former employer.\n\nThiero is the second former Kentucky player to pledge his future to the Razorbacks after Zvonimir Ivi\u0161i\u0107 announced in April he's making the trip south. Karter Knox, Billy Richmond and Boogie Fland were all Kentucky commits who reversed course and are now committed to the Razorbacks as well.\n\nCalipari has also added former FAU guard Johnell Davis and former Tennessee center Jonas Aidoo out of the transfer portal.\n\nThere's no question the 65-year-old and his staff have done a great job to fill out their squad in a relatively short amount of time. Expectations are still likely to remain somewhat tempered in his first season due to the massive turnover within the Razorbacks.\n\nIn terms of the long-term goal of making Arkansas a Final Four team again, Calipari is arguably ahead of schedule so far.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_zucker@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Joseph Zucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calipari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Calipari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Tipton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Tipton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayetteville,_Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fayetteville, Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fayetteville, Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Razorbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Razorbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnell_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnell Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnover_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turnover (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_College_(Illinois)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knox College (Illinois)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Intranet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Intranet", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Voice_Portals", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Voice Portals", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Intranet/Corporate_Portals", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Intranet/Corporate Portals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_22,y_0,w_1713,h_1142,c_crop/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1715019232/eag71lllj7hui5elgnc0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543705", "eventUri": "eng-9543705", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

In the process, the head coach has landed another player he is very familiar with.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Jeff Borzello and Jonathan Givony, the Razorbacks are landing Kentucky transfer Adou Thiero. The 6-foot-8 forward is already a player on the rise in regard to the 2025 NBA Draft, and he's following Calipari after 2 seasons with the Wildcats.\n\n\"I started with Coach Cal and want to see it through with him,\" he said. \"Very excited to join the family and ready to get to work... After already playing for him and developing after two years, I feel that he knows my game and will put me in the right position to succeed and achieve my goals.\"\n\nThiero made a big leap from his freshman to sophomore season, starting 19 games (25 appearances) last season while averaging 7.2 points and 4 rebounds. He shot 49% from the floor and just shy of 53% from inside the arc.\n\nCalipari has been working hard to reshape the Razorbacks for his first season, and he has utilized some key SEC transfers to make it happen. Along with Thiero, Arkansas also added former Wildcat Zvonimir Ivisic.\n\nFormer Tennessee big man Jonas Aidoo gives the Razorbacks a trio of SEC transfers, and that group is poised to make a major impact right out of the gate. Johnell Davis, a 6-foot-4 guard from FAU, is the other transfer piece currently committed to Arkansas.\n\nAlong with the more veteran presence those players will bring, Arkansas has picked up some ultra-elite high school commitments this cycle. After originally committing to Kentucky while Calipari was there, the Razorbacks have since added commitments from Boogie Fland, Karter Knox and Billy Richmond. Each of those players is a 5-star recruit for the 2024 recruiting class.\n\nWith that kind of firepower, Calipari and Arkansas will be in the mix for the SEC title during the 2024-25 season.", "source": {"uri": "saturdaydownsouth.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saturday Down South"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Razorbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas Razorbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calipari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Calipari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnell_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnell Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Atlantic_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Atlantic University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_College_(Illinois)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knox College (Illinois)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_22770228-scaled-e1715020798729.jpg?w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543705", "eventUri": "eng-9543705", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Thiero is the fifth former Kentucky player or committed player to follow Calipari to Arkansas this offseason.\n\nThe news of Thiero's commitment comes days after Calipari landed former Florida Atlantic star Johnell Davis, who ranks as the No. 1 player in the CBS Sports Transfer Rankings. The 2023-24 AAC co-Player of the Year is the second major transfer portal addition Calipari has landed in his tenure, joining Tennessee forward Jonas Aidoo. Aidoo is one the best 2024 transfers in college basketball and was one of the best defensive players in the country at his position.\n\nLast month, Arkansas landed a commitment from four-star wing Billy Richmond, who previously signed his National Letter of Intent to play for Calipari at Kentucky.\n\nRichmond is the third member of Kentucky's star-studded 2024 recruiting class to follow Calipari to Arkansas. Four-star forward Karter Knox was the first to flip his commitment to Arkansas to play for Calipari. The Knox family has ties to Calipari, as his older brother, Kevin Knox ll, played for him at Kentucky during the 2017-18 season.\n\nCalipari's second high school commitment of the offseason came from another former player from his recruiting class at Kentucky. Calipari landed four-star guard Boogie Fland shortly on Thursday. The first commitment of the Calipari era at Arkansas was another familiar face in Zvonimir Ivi\u0161i\u0107, who played at Kentucky last season.\n\nThere is still plenty of work for Calipari and his staff to do to form a complete roster ahead of the season that starts in less than seven months, but after making the biggest splash of the offseason earlier this month to replace former coach Eric Musselman with one of the prominent figures in the sport, the Razorbacks are off to a strong start.\n\nCBS Sports is tracking the status of the Arkansas roster and recruiting class in real time. Here's where every current Arkansas player and commitment currently stand.\n\nArkansas newcomersZvonimir Ivi\u0161i\u0107 (Transfer from Kentucky)\n\nGP: 15 | GS: 0 | PPG: 5.5 | RPG: 3.3\n\nWhile Ivi\u0161i\u0107 didn't play a ton during his freshman season, he made an impact when he played. Hours after he was ruled eligible by the NCAA on Jan. 20, Ivi\u0161i\u0107 recorded 13 points, five rebounds, and a pair of assists in his collegiate debut. Days after Ivi\u0161i\u0107 entered the transfer portal, he announced he would follow Calipari and had committed to Arkansas. He should see a larger role in Year 2.\n\nJonas Aidoo (Transfer from Tennessee)\n\nGP: 36 | GS: 36 | PPG: 11.4 | RPG: 7.3\n\nAidoo is one of the more underrated players in the country because he can play the four or the five and defend both positions at a high level. Aidoo was one of the top-shot blockers in the SEC last season (1.8 bpg.) Aidoo should be in line to be a Day 1 starter for Calipari after he started all 36 games this past season for the Volunteers.\n\nJohnell Davis (Transfer from FAU)\n\nGP: 34 | GS: 34 | PPG: 18.2 | RPG: 6.3\n\nDavis was one of the best mid-major players in the country last season. After spending four seasons at FAU, Davis entered the transfer portal and simultaneously declared for the 2024 NBA Draft. Davis will go through the draft process this month before making a final decision. If he does indeed return to college, it would be a massive boost for the Razorbacks.\n\nAdou Thiero (Transfer from Arkansas)\n\nGP: 25 | GS: 19 | PPG: 7.2 | RPG: 5\n\nThiero entered his name into the transfer portal last month and was the No. 77 player available in David Cobb's transfer portal rankings. Thiero saw a larger role during his second season in Lexington, making 19 starts and 25 appearances while averaging career-highs in almost every statistical category.\n\nArkansas players not expected to returnTramon Mark (Committed to Texas)\n\nGP: 31 | GS: 28 | PPG: 16.2 | RPG: 4.3\n\nMark will be at his third school in three years after transferring into the program from Houston last offseason. The 6-foot-6 guard is coming off the best season of his career and posted a career-high in points. Mark committed to Texas to continue his college career.\n\nKhalif Battle (In transfer portal)\n\nGP: 32 | GS: 13 | PPG: 14.8 | RPG: 3.3\n\nBattle started his career at Butler during the 2019-20 campaign before transferring to Temple. Battle spent three seasons with Temple before spending his only season with the Razorbacks. Battle's next and final stop of his college career will be his fourth school. He entered the transfer portal earlier this month.\n\nMakhi Mitchell (Out of eligibility)\n\nGP: 33 | GS: 5 | PPG: 8.6 | RPG: 4.6\n\nMitchell averaged 8.6 points and started five games for Arkansas this past season. Before his arrival in Fayetteville, Arkansas, he had stops at Maryland and Rhode Island.\n\nTrevon Brazile (Declared for NBA Draft/entered transfer portal)\n\nGP: 26 | GS: 23 | PPG: 8.6 | RPG: 5.9\n\nBrazile declared for the 2024 NBA Draft after averaging 8.6 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game. Brazile started his career at Missouri before transferring to Arkansas ahead of the 2022-23 season. Brazlie entered the transfer portal hours before the deadline.\n\nKeyon Menifield Jr. (In transfer portal)\n\nGP: 14 | GS: 4 | PPG: 7.9 | RPG: 2.1\n\nMenifield started 21 games during his freshman season at Washington before transferring to Arkansas. He started four games and appeared in 14 total games. He will be looking for his third school in three years.\n\nJalen Graham (Out of eligibility)\n\nGP: 21 | GS: 5 | PPG: 7.6 | RPG: 3.0\n\nAfter spending the first three years of his career at Arizona State, Graham transferred to Arkansas. He averaged 7.6 points in his final college season.\n\nEl Ellis (Out of eligibility)\n\nGP: 31 | GS: 22 | PPG: 6.5 | RPG: 2.0\n\nThe former Louisville guard averaged 17.7 points and 4.4 assists during the 2022-23 campaign. He started 22 games in his final college season at Arkansas and averaged a career-low 6.5 points per game.\n\nDavonte Davis (In transfer portal)\n\nGP: 30 | GS: 23 | PPG: 5.9 | RPG: 3.4\n\nThe former three-star prospect committed to Arkansas in the 2020 recruiting cycle and spent the last four seasons with the program. The highlight of his Arkansas career was a 25-point outburst in a win over Kansas in the second round of the 2023 NCAA Tournament.\n\nJeremiah Davenport (Out of eligibility)\n\nGP: 31 | GS: 8 | PPG: 5.0 | RPG: 1.8\n\nDavenport spent the first four seasons of his college career at Cincinnati before transferring to Arkansas last offseason. He appeared in 31 games and averaged 5.0 points, 1.8 rebounds and 0.9 assists.\n\nLayden Blocker (In transfer portal)\n\nGP: 27 | GS: 5 | PPG: 3.7 | RPG: 1.6\n\nThe former four-star prospect from the 2023 recruiting cycle averaged 3.7 points, 1.6 rebounds, and 1.0 assists during his freshman season in Fayetteville. Blocker entered the transfer portal last month.\n\nChandler Lawson (Out of eligibility)\n\nGP: 33 | GS: 27 | PPG: 3.7 | RPG: 3.1\n\nLawson was a four-star prospect in the 2019 recruiting cycle and had stops at Oregon and Memphis before spending his final college season with Arkansas. Lawson started 27 games and made 33 total appearances.\n\nJoseph Pinion (In transfer portal)\n\nGP: 19 | GS: 1 | PPG: 2.4 | RPG: 0.6\n\nPinion entered the transfer portal after appearing in 19 games this past season with Arkansas. He made 26 appearances during the 2022-23 campaign.\n\nBaye Fall (In transfer portal)\n\nGP: 9 | GS: 0 | PPG: 0.8 | RPG: 1.3\n\nFall entered the transfer portal after making nine appearances this past season. Fall was the No. 29 overall player in the 2023 recruiting cycle by 247Sports.\n\nDenijay Harris (In transfer portal)\n\nGP: 11 | GS: 1 | PPG: 0.6 | RPG: 0.8\n\nHarris entered the transfer portal after appearing in 11 games this past season. He spent the three years before that at Southern Miss.\n\nArkansas recruits no longer committedNo. 45 Isaiah Elohim (Committed to USC)\n\nThe former Arkansas signee requested a release from his National Letter of Intent shortly after Musselman took the job at USC. Elohim committed to USC on Monday.\n\nNo. 72 Jalen Shelley\n\nLike Elohim, Shelley de-committed from Arkansas shortly after the coaching change. Shelley committed to the Razorbacks out of high school over Louisville, Alabama, Creighton, Houston, and more. He is expected to have plenty of suitors for his services because he is one of the top uncommitted players on the board.\n\nArkansas' incoming recruiting class\n\nKentucky finished with a top-five recruiting class every cycle since 247Sports started tracking team rankings in 2010 under Calipari. The Wildcats landed the No. 1 recruiting class in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2020, and 2023 under his watch. But in an era when age and experience rule the day in college basketball, relying so heavily on one-and-done prospects began to hurt Kentucky in recent seasons. Kentucky's 2024 recruiting star-studded class ranked only behind Duke in the team rankings. Most of Calipari's previous commits at Kentucky are expected to at least give Arkansas a look before deciding where they will play next season.\n\nHere is a look at Arkansas' roster and incoming recruiting class with 247Sports rankings.\n\nNo. 20 Karter Knox (Previously committed to Kentucky)\n\nKnox committed to Kentucky on March 9 over Louisville, USF, and a return to Overtime Elite. He was the highest-ranked high school player on the board available after former Indiana signee Liam McNeeley requested a release from his NLI. Knox's brother, Kobe, is a current player at USF. Former Kentucky assistant coach Kenny Payne, now on Calipari's staff at Arkansas, helped recruit Kevin to Kentucky and attempted to recruit Karter to Louisville before his firing.\n\nNo. 22 Billy Richmond (Previously committed to Kentucky)\n\nRichmond committed to Kentucky on Dec. 21 over Alabama, LSU, and Memphis but decommitted on April 16. The Richmond family has deep ties to Calipari. Richmond's father, who is also named Billy Richmond, played for Calipari at Memphis from 2002 to 2004. Richmond is considered an athletic lefty wing with the chance to make an immediate impact when he steps onto campus this fall at Arkansas.\n\nNo. 26 Boogie Fland (Previously committed to Kentucky)\n\nThe McDonald's All-American is one of the best combo guards in the country and ranked only behind Rutgers signee Dylan Harper for the top player at the position. Fland originally committed to Kentucky over Alabama, UConn, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, and St. John's. Fland followed Calipari to Arkansas and will play for the Razorbacks this season.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Calipari was hired at Arkansas in April, replacing Eric Musselman, who left for Southern California.\n\nWith the Wildcats, Thiero broke out during his sophomore year last season. He averaged 7.2 points, 5 rebounds and more than a block per game in 25 games, 19 of which were starts. He also shot 49% from the floor, 32% from 3-point range and 80% from the free-throw line.\n\nThiero was the No. 10 transfer portal in the portal, according to 247Sports, and was being recruited by North Carolina, Indiana and Pittsburgh, in addition to Kentucky coach Mark Pope attempting to get him to stay.\n\nCalipari has now landed three former Kentucky players and three former Kentucky high-school commits since taking the job at Arkansas.

Microsoft held an observer role on OpenAI's board. The company informed OpenAI the same in a letter. Microsoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI. The company has been integrating OpenAI's tech across its Windows portfolio.\n\nPost Microsoft announcement, OpenAI spokesperson said that the startup won't have board observers after Microsoft's departure.There were reports that Apple was due to take up a similar role as Microsoft in OpenAI. At its recent annual developers conference, WWDC2024, Apple announced an AI partnership with OpenAI. Apple would not take the observer role on OpenAI's board after being widely expected to do so, the Financial Times reported, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nMicrosoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November 2023 after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was fired unceremoniously. He was taken back just hours later in a management reshuffle that also saw board shakeup. The seat meant that Microsoft could attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including selecting or choosing directors. Apple joining the board would have meant the same rights for the iPhone maker.\n\n\"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,\" OpenAI said in a statement to Bloomberg News. Apple's partnership with OpenAI brings ChatGPT to iPhones.\n\nWhat's behind Microsoft giving up board seat\n\nMicrosoft has relinquished its board seat after regulatory pressure in Europe and the US. Last month, European Union (EU) antitrust regulators said that the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI would not be subjected to the bloc's merger rules because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement.\n\nThe British and US antitrust watchdogs too continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the latter's independence. In January, the US Federal Trade Commission said it was looking into Microsoft's investment in OpenAI as part of a broader inquiry into Big Tech companies and their partnerships with AI startups.\n\nThe TOI Tech Desk is a dedicated team of journalists committed to delivering the latest and most relevant news from the world of technology to readers of The Times of India.

According to SenseTime, SenseNova 5.5 is comparable with GPT-4o, the flagship artificial intelligence model of the Microsoft-backed US company OpenAI.\n\nIf that wasn't enough to entice users, SenseTime is also giving away 50m free tokens - digital credits for using the AI - and says that it will deploy staff to help new clients migrate from OpenAI services to SenseTime's products for free.\n\nChinese attempts to lure domestic developers away from OpenAI - considered the market leader in generative AI - will now be a lot easier, after OpenAI notified its users in China that they would be blocked from using its tools and services from 9 July.\n\n\"We are taking additional steps to block API traffic from regions where we do not support access to OpenAI's services,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told Bloomberg last month.\n\nOpenAI has not elaborated about the reason for its sudden decision. ChatGPT is already blocked in China by the government's firewall, but until this week developers could use virtual private networks to access OpenAI's tools in order to fine-tune their own generative AI applications and benchmark their own research. Now the block is coming from the US side.\n\nRising tensions between Washington and Beijing have prompted the US to restrict the export to China of certain advanced semiconductors that are vital for training the most cutting-edge AI technology, putting pressure on other parts of the AI industry.\n\nThe OpenAI move has \"caused significant concern within China's AI community\" said Xiaohu Zhu, the founder of the Shanghai-based Centre for Safe AGI, which promotes AI safety, not least because \"the decision raises questions about equitable access to AI technologies globally\".\n\nBut it has also created an opportunity for domestic AI companies such as SenseTime, which are scrambling to hoover up OpenAI's rejected users. After warnings about OpenAI's decision circulated last month, Baidu offered 50m free tokens for its Ernie 3.5 AI model, as well as free migration services, while Zhipu AI, another local company, offered 150m free tokens for its model. Tencent Cloud is giving away 100m free tokens for its AI model to new users until the end of July. \"Competitors are offering migration pathways for former OpenAI users, seeing this as an opportunity to expand their user base,\" said Zhu.\n\nOne consequence of OpenAI's decision may be that it accelerates the development of Chinese AI companies, which are in tight competition with their US rivals, as well as each other. China is estimated to have at least 130 large language models, accounting for 40% of the world's total and second only to the US. But while US companies such as OpenAI have been at the cutting edge of generative AI, Chinese companies have been engaged in a price war that some analysts have speculated may harm their profit margins and their ability to innovate. Still, Winston Ma, a professor at New York University who writes about Chinese technology, said OpenAI's departure from China comes \"at a time when Chinese big tech players are closing on performance gap with OpenAI and are offering these Chinese LLM models essentially free\".\n\n\"OpenAI's departure is a short-term shock to the China market, but it may provide a long-term opportunity for Chinese domestic LLM models to be put to the real test,\" said Ma. Until now, Chinese companies have focused on the commercialisation of large language models rather than advancing the models themselves, he added.\n\nChinese commentators have been keen to brush off the impact of OpenAI's decision. State media outlet the Global Times said it was \"a push from the US to hamper China's technology development\". Pan Helin, a digital economy researcher at Zhejiang University who sits on a government technology committee, described the development as \"a good thing for China's large-scale model independence and self-reliance\", according to Chinese media.\n\nBut there are signs that the US restrictions on China's AI industry are starting to bite. The online video giant Kuaishou recently had to restrict the number of people who could access its new text-to-video AI model, Kling, because of a lack of computing capacity caused by a shortage of chips, according to a report in The Information. And there is now a booming hidden market for US semiconductors, as companies find ways to circumvent the sanctions. Being blocked from US software may inspire similar creativity.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Both Apple and Microsoft drop their respective observer seats on OpenAI's board of directors\n\nTwo big names in the tech industry, Apple and Microsoft, have taken a step back from their respective involvements with OpenAI's board of directors.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that Microsoft has given up its seat as an observer on the board at OpenAI. Meanwhile Apple will reportedly not take up a similar position on the board.\n\nMicrosoft has occupied an observer position on OpenAI's board ever since Microsoft made clear its displeasure with the previous not-for-profit board, which in November 2023 had unexpectedly fired CEO Sam Altman.\n\nObserver positions\n\nDays later, and under intense pressure from Microsoft, OpenAI had rehired Sam Altman after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had called for a \"change\" in the governance of OpenAI.\n\nWhen Sam Altman was reinstated as CEO, a new board of directors was also appointed, with Microsoft taking an observer seat due to the fact that Redmond, is by far, OpenAI's biggest investor (up to $13 billion).\n\nOpenAI also heavily depends on Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure for its costly computing infrastructure.\n\nMeanwhile it emerged last week that Apple fellow Phil Schiller, the iPhone maker's former marketing chief, was to given an observer role on OpenAI's board.\n\nSchiller's appointment was due to Apple announcing at its annual WWDC developer conference, that it would bring OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot to its devices including iPads, iPhones, Vision Pro headsets and Macs later this year.\n\nBoard withdrawal\n\nBut now the Financial Times has reported that Microsoft has given up its seat as an observer on the board of OpenAI while Apple will not take up a similar position.\n\nMicrosoft reportedly said in a letter to OpenAI that its withdrawal from its board role would be \"effective immediately\".\n\nApple had also been expected to take an observer role on OpenAI's board as part of a deal to integrate ChatGPT into the iPhone maker's devices, the FT reported, but would not do so, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nRead also : Keepler, Databricks Partner To Develop Intelligent Data Platforms\n\nApple declined to comment on the matter, the FT reported.\n\nInstead OpenAI will host regular meetings with partners such as Microsoft and Apple and investors Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures - part of \"a new approach to informing and engaging key strategic partners\" under Sarah Friar, the former Nextdoor boss who was hired as its first chief financial officer last month, an OpenAI spokesperson was quoted as saying.\n\nRegulatory pressure\n\nThe Microsoft retreat from governance oversight of OpenAI's board of directors comes as antitrust authorities in both the EU and US examine the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI as part of broader concerns about competition in the rapidly growing AI sector.\n\n\"This position provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence,\" Microsoft's deputy general counsel Keith Dolliver was quoted by AP as writing in a letter to OpenAI late on Tuesday.\n\nSince then \"we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\" Therefore, Microsoft's role on the board was no longer \"necessary\", he reportedly added.\n\nOpenAI remains one of Microsoft's \"most valued partners\", Dolliver wrote.\n\nMicrosoft does not have a conventional equity stake in OpenAI. Instead, it has an entitlement to a share of the profits from a subsidiary of OpenAI, up to a certain limit.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson reportedly said: \"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.\"\n\nOpenAI's eight-person board of directors includes Altman as well as Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, and Fidji Simo, chief executive of grocery delivery company Instacart.\n\nIt is chaired by Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of Salesforce.\n\nRead also : Made in

Apple, which was also expected to get an observer role on the OpenAI board for veteran Phil Schiller has ultimately declined this opportunity, according to a new report from the Financial Times.\n\nIn a letter sent to OpenAI yesterday and seen by Axios, Microsoft justified its decision to give up its observer seat on OpenAI's board by the fact that it was no longer necessary. Dee Templeton, a vice president for technology and research partnerships and operations at Microsoft joined OpenAI's reconstituted board earlier this year after the previous board had fired and then rehired OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\n\"As you know, we accepted the non-voting board observer role at a time when OpenAI was in the process of rebuilding its board,\" Microsoft said in the letter. \"This position provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence, and we appreciated the opportunity to serve as an observer during this period of change. Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\"\n\nIn a statement shared with The Verge, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe explained how the company plans to keep its biggest partners and investors involved in its strategic decisions going forward. This will happen through \"regular stakeholder meetings to share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security.\"\n\nIn recent years, Microsoft invested over $10 billion into OpenAI, which is now using the Microsoft Azure cloud to develop and run its AI models at a global scale. Microsoft also obtained an exclusive license on OpenAI's GPT-4 models, and the company's close relationship with the ChatGPT makers led regulators in the US, the UK, and the EU to investigate.\n\nApple's situation is quite different as it's a latecomer to the generative AI race. Apple will reportedly not pay OpenAI any money for integrating ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence later this year, and the company said that it's looking to integrate more third-party AI models into its personal intelligence system. Anyway, the company getting an observer role on OpenAI's board would have cemented the company's partnership with OpenAI, but the FT now says it's no longer happening, citing one person with direct knowledge of the situation.", "source": {"uri": "thurrott.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Thurrott.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laurent_giret@thurrott.com", "name": "Laurent Giret", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://thurrott-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/web/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/OpenAI-board.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

This decision comes after notable improvements in OpenAI's governance over the past eight months, reported Reuters. In November 2023, Microsoft assumed a non-voting observer role on OpenAI's board, enabling it to attend meetings and access confidential information without influencing decisions. This move coincided with Sam Altman's return as CEO of OpenAI, the company known for its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nMicrosoft's substantial investment of over $10 billion in OpenAI had raised antitrust alarms in Europe, Britain, and the United States regarding the extent of its control over the AI startup.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that Apple, which recently announced the integration of ChatGPT into its devices, was anticipated to take on the observer role but has decided against it. Apple has not provided any comments on this matter, as per Reuters.\n\nAccording to Reuters, an OpenAI spokesperson revealed that the company plans to adopt a new engagement strategy, involving regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple, along with investors like Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\n\nMicrosoft cited OpenAI's new collaborations, innovative strides, and expanding customer base as reasons for stepping down from the observer position. In a letter dated July 9, Microsoft expressed confidence in OpenAI's direction, stating, \"Over the past eight months, we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this, we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nWhile EU regulators have stated that Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI does not fall under the bloc's merger regulations, they will seek third-party input on the exclusivity clauses within the agreement. Meanwhile, British and US antitrust authorities continue to scrutinise Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the startup's autonomy.\n\nAs competition to provide AI technology to enterprise customers heats up, Microsoft and OpenAI are striving to prove their independence and address regulatory concerns. Microsoft is also broadening its AI capabilities on its Azure platform and has appointed the CEO of Inflection to lead its consumer AI division, indicating a strategic move to diversify beyond OpenAI.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shayak_majumder@news.abplive.com", "name": "Shayak Majumder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/07/10/d93e3ee2a0759842456440ce828c5ed91720611984634402_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 1416, "textEnd": 1422}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

According to SenseTime, SenseNova 5.5 is comparable with GPT-4o, the flagship artificial intelligence model of the Microsoft-backed US company OpenAI.\n\nIf that wasn't enough to entice users, SenseTime is also giving away 50m free tokens - digital credits for using the AI - and says that it will deploy staff to help new clients migrate from OpenAI services to SenseTime's products for free.\n\nChinese attempts to lure domestic developers away from OpenAI - considered the market leader in generative AI - will now be a lot easier, after OpenAI notified its users in China that they would be blocked from using its tools and services from 9 July.\n\n\"We are taking additional steps to block API traffic from regions where we do not support access to OpenAI's services,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told Bloomberg last month.\n\nOpenAI has not elaborated about the reason for its sudden decision. ChatGPT is already blocked in China by the government's firewall, but until this week developers could use virtual private networks to access OpenAI's tools in order to fine-tune their own generative AI applications and benchmark their own research. Now the block is coming from the US side.\n\nRising tensions between Washington and Beijing have prompted the US to restrict the export to China of certain advanced semiconductors that are vital for training the most cutting-edge AI technology, putting pressure on other parts of the AI industry.\n\nThe OpenAI move has \"caused significant concern within China's AI community\" said Xiaohu Zhu, the founder of the Shanghai-based Centre for Safe AGI, which promotes AI safety, not least because \"the decision raises questions about equitable access to AI technologies globally\".\n\nBut it has also created an opportunity for domestic AI companies such as SenseTime, which are scrambling to hoover up OpenAI's rejected users. After warnings about OpenAI's decision circulated last month, Baidu offered 50m free tokens for its Ernie 3.5 AI model, as well as free migration services, while Zhipu AI, another local company, offered 150m free tokens for its model. Tencent Cloud is giving away 100m free tokens for its AI model to new users until the end of July. \"Competitors are offering migration pathways for former OpenAI users, seeing this as an opportunity to expand their user base,\" said Zhu.\n\nOne consequence of OpenAI's decision may be that it accelerates the development of Chinese AI companies, which are in tight competition with their US rivals, as well as each other. China is estimated to have at least 130 large language models, accounting for 40% of the world's total and second only to the US. But while US companies such as OpenAI have been at the cutting edge of generative AI, Chinese companies have been engaged in a price war that some analysts have speculated may harm their profit margins and their ability to innovate. Still, Winston Ma, a professor at New York University who writes about Chinese technology, said OpenAI's departure from China comes \"at a time when Chinese big tech players are closing on performance gap with OpenAI and are offering these Chinese LLM models essentially free\".\n\n\"OpenAI's departure is a short-term shock to the China market, but it may provide a long-term opportunity for Chinese domestic LLM models to be put to the real test,\" said Ma. Until now, Chinese companies have focused on the commercialisation of large language models rather than advancing the models themselves, he added.\n\nChinese commentators have been keen to brush off the impact of OpenAI's decision. State media outlet the Global Times said it was \"a push from the US to hamper China's technology development\". Pan Helin, a digital economy researcher at Zhejiang University who sits on a government technology committee, described the development as \"a good thing for China's large-scale model independence and self-reliance\", according to Chinese media.\n\nBut there are signs that the US restrictions on China's AI industry are starting to bite. The online video giant Kuaishou recently had to restrict the number of people who could access its new text-to-video AI model, Kling, because of a lack of computing capacity caused by a shortage of chips, according to a report in The Information. And there is now a booming hidden market for US semiconductors, as companies find ways to circumvent the sanctions. Being blocked from US software may inspire similar creativity.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_hawkins@theguardian.com",

Until recently, the tech giant held a non-voting observer seat on the OpenAI board. Axios and The Financial Times reported on a letter written to OpenAI by Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Keith Dolliver that announced the move. The Verge then received confirmation from OpenAI that Microsoft had given up its seat on the OpenAI board.\n\n\"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,\" said an OpenAI spokesperson to The Verge. \"Under the leadership of CFO Sarah Friar, we are establishing a new approach to informing and engaging key strategic partners - such as Microsoft and Apple - and investors - such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\"\n\nWhile Microsoft will not have a seat on OpenAI's board, the tech giant will be kept up to date of what's going on through \"regular stakeholder meetings.\"\n\nMicrosoft's relationship with OpenAI is complicated and storied. OpenAI exclusively partners with OpenAI for the cloud. That partnership came as part of an investment by Microsoft of over $10 billion. Microsoft has integrated OpenAI tech into a wide range of its services, including Copilot and Bing. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said AI tools would be built into all Microsoft products back in January 2023. Since then, several services have been infused with AI tech, often from OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft ended up with a non-voting seat on the OpenAI board after a dramatic few days that saw OpenAI co-founder and CEO forced out of the company, though Altman later returned. Microsoft was reportedly furious when blindsided by Altman's firing. The tech giant gaining a non-voting seat on the OpenAI board was viewed, at least in part, as a way to prevent future surprises.\n\nAxios shared contents of the letter written by Microsoft:\n\n\"We appreciate the support shown by OpenAI leadership and the OpenAI board as we made this decision...\n\nAs you know, we accepted the non-voting board observer role at a time when OpenAI was in the process of rebuilding its board. This position provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence, and we appreciated the opportunity to serve as an observer during this period of change.\n\nOver the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\n\nGiven all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nBased on Microsoft's comments, it appears the company is content with OpenAI's current board.\n\nMicrosoft giving up its non-voting seat on the OpenAI board may also help Microsoft better face scrutiny from regulators.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.An OpenAI spokesman said the company will establish a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple, and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.Microsoft took a nonvoting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November last year after OpenAI Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sam Altman took back the reins of the company which operates the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT.The seat meant it could attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.The observer seat and Microsoft's more than $10-billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the United States over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.Microsoft cited OpenAI's new partnerships, innovation and growing customer base since Altman's return to the startup for giving up its observer seat.\"Over the past eight months, we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this, we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.European Union antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subjected to the bloc's merger rules because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement.In contrast, the British and US antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the latter's independence.Microsoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns.Additionally, Microsoft is expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform and has hired Inflection's CEO to head its consumer AI division, a move widely interpreted as an effort to diversify beyond OpenAI.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered

Microsoft has reportedly invested $13 billion in OpenAI.\n\nEuropean Union regulators said last month that they would take a fresh look at the partnership under the 27-nation bloc's antitrust rules, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Britain's competition watchdog have also been examining the pact.\n\nMicrosoft took the board seat following a power struggle in which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was fired, then quickly reinstated, while the board members behind the ouster were pushed out.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" Microsoft said in its letter. \"Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nWith Microsoft's departure, OpenAI will no longer have observer seats on its board.\n\n\"We are grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,\" OpenAI said in a statement.\n\nIt's not hard to conclude that Microsoft's decision to ditch the board seat was heavily influenced by rising scrutiny of big technology companies and their links with AI startups, said Alex Haffner, a competition partner at U.K. law firm Fladgate.\n\n\"It is clear that regulators are very much focused on the complex web of inter-relationships that Big Tech has created with AI providers, hence the need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward,\" he said.\n\nOpenAI

This decision came after Apple revealed last month that it would introduce OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT to its devices. When asked for comment, Apple remained silent.\n\nThrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, and Microsoft and Apple are among OpenAI's key partners and investors; the business plans to have frequent stakeholder meetings to implement a new engagement strategy, according to a representative from OpenAI.\n\nFollowing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's reascendance to the helm of the business that runs the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT in November of last year, Microsoft assumed the role of an observer on the board without voting power.

However, they stated that they would seek third-party opinions on the exclusivity restrictions in the agreement since Microsoft does not control OpenAI.\n\nThe antitrust authorities in the United Kingdom and the United States, on the other hand, are still worried about Microsoft's influence on OpenAI and doubt its independence. With the goal of making money and proving their independence to antitrust regulators, Microsoft and OpenAI are becoming more competitive in selling AI technology to commercial clients.\n\nIt is commonly believed that Microsoft is trying to diversify its AI products beyond OpenAI by hiring Inflection's CEO to head its consumer AI group and expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/07/yaj0kd7vu0_th_1024x0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 2125, "textEnd": 2131}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company would establish a new approach to engaging with stakeholders by hosting regular meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple, and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\n\nMicrosoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company.\n\nThe seat meant Microsoft could attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.\n\nThe observer seat and Microsoft's more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in the European Union, Britain and the U.S. over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.\n\nThe position provided insights into the board's work without compromising its independence, Microsoft said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.\n\nIt cited OpenAI's new partnerships, innovation, and growing customer base since Altman's return to the startup as reasons for giving up its observer seat.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" it said in the letter.\n\nEU antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subjected to the bloc's merger rules because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement.\n\nIn contrast, British and U.S. antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the latter's independence.\n\nMicrosoft is making a smart move by dropping the one tangible evidence of possible control over OpenAI, making it harder for antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to prove otherwise, said an antitrust lawyer who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nBritain's Competition and Markets Authority declined to comment.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft is expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform and has hired Inflection's CEO to head its consumer AI division, a move widely interpreted as an effort to diversify beyond OpenAI.

Apple is not expected to take up a similar observer role, The Financial Times reported. The moves may be an attempt to ease regulatory concerns over their influence in the AI sector.\n\nMicrosoft and Apple might have made a play to assuage antitrust regulators over their involvement with OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has now relinquished its role as an observer on OpenAI's board, while Apple will not take up a similar spot, according to reports by outlets including The Financial Times.\n\nAlthough Microsoft had no voting rights, its decision may be a bid to ease the concerns of regulators, who have been trying to assess its influence over OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft won an observer role following the brief ousting of Sam Altman as OpenAI's CEO last November.\n\nBut late Tuesday the company said it was not \"necessary\" to keep its seat after witnessing \"significant progress\" in the past eight months, according to a letter Microsoft sent to OpenAI seen by outlets including Axios and the Financial Times.\n\nMicrosoft also said in the letter that it's \"confident\" about OpenAI's \"direction.\"\n\nAlex Haffner, a competition partner at law firm Fladgate, told BI: \"It is hard not to conclude that Microsoft's decision has been heavily influenced by the ongoing competition/antitrust scrutiny of its (and other major tech players) influence over emerging AI players such as OpenAI.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is clear that regulators are very much focused on the complex web of interrelationships that Big Tech has created with AI providers, hence the need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward.\"\n\nMicrosoft has invested billions in the ChatGPT maker and gets nearly half of OpenAI's profits as part of the partnership deal. OpenAI still relies on Microsoft's cloud services for the computing power needed to train and run its large language models (LLMs).\n\nNew approach\n\nThe partnership has been considered to have given Microsoft a leg up in the AI race, as OpenAI's models power its AI features such as Copilot.\n\nAn OpenAI representative told BI that its new CFO, Sarah Friar, was taking a new approach to engaging with partners such as Microsoft and Apple, and investors including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\n\n\"Moving forward, we will host regular stakeholder meetings to share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security,\" they said.\n\nApple is set to follow Microsoft's lead, retreating from its plan to take on a similar board observer role, the FT reported. Bloomberg previously reported that Apple had secured an observer seat.\n\nAntitrust scrutiny\n\nThis came after Apple announced it struck a partnership with OpenAI at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, integrating ChatGPT into its devices including the iPhone as part of a broader AI push.\n\nThe pullback underscores the mounting antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech's grip on AI. Regulators in both the US and UK have raised concerns about potential market control through strategic partnerships.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI are both facing regulatory scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. European regulators have also been assessing the partnership.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Microsoft and Apple's moves will placate those concerns about their involvement with OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jyoti_mann@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Jyoti Mann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition and Markets Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/654e04993cc84b4dfaffe3e1?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

(AP Photo/Barbara Ortutay, File)\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company\u00b4s direction,\" Microsoft said in its letter. \"Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nWith Microsoft's departure, OpenAI will no longer have observer seats on its board.\n\n\"We are grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,\" OpenAI said in a statement.\n\nIt's not hard to conclude that Microsoft's decision to ditch the board seat was heavily influenced by rising scrutiny of big technology companies and their links with AI startups, said Alex Haffner, a competition partner at U.K. law firm Fladgate.\n\n\"It is clear that regulators are very much focused on the complex web of inter-relationships that Big Tech has created with AI providers, hence the need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward,\" he said.\n\nOpenAI said it would take a new approach to \"informing and engaging key strategic partners\" such as Microsoft and Apple and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, with regular meetings to update stakeholders on progress and ensure stronger collaboration on safety and security.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/10/12/wire-87154961-1720609453-564_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

This move intensifies competition as companies like SenseTime and Baidu seek to fill the gap left by OpenAI.\n\nSenseTime Launches SenseNova 5.5, Offering Free Tokens and Transition Assistance Amid OpenAI Ban in China\n\nLast week, SenseTime, one of China's foremost artificial intelligence organizations, introduced its most recent model, SenseNova 5.5, at the World AI Conference in Shanghai.\n\nThe model demonstrated its capacity to read and summarize a page of text instantaneously, provide feedback on a rabbit drawing, and identify and describe a stuffed toy puppy (wearing a SenseTime cap). According to SenseTime, SenseNova 5.5 is comparable to GPT-4o, the flagship artificial intelligence model of the US company OpenAI, which Microsoft supports.\n\nSenseTime offers 50 million complimentary tokens and digital credits for utilizing AI if more is needed to attract users. Additionally, the company has announced that it will provide staff to assist new clients in transitioning from OpenAI services to SenseTime's products at no cost.\n\nThe Chinese government's efforts to entice domestic developers to abandon OpenAI, widely regarded as the market leader in generative AI, will now be significantly easier since OpenAI has informed its users in China that they will be prohibited from using its tools and services effective July 9.\n\n\"We are taking additional steps to block API traffic from regions where we do not support access to OpenAI's services,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told Bloomberg last month.\n\nOpenAI has refrained from providing a detailed explanation for its abrupt decision. The government's firewall has already blocked ChatGPT in China. However, developers could access OpenAI's tools by utilizing virtual private networks until this week to refine their generative AI applications and benchmark their research. Currently, obstruction emanates from the United States.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, due to increasing tensions between Washington and Beijing, the US has restricted the export of specific advanced semiconductors to China, which are essential for training the most advanced AI technology. This has placed pressure on other sectors of the AI industry.\n\nOpenAI's Exit from China Sparks AI Innovation, Domestic Firms Offer Free Tokens and Migration Services\n\nXiaohu Zhu, the founder of the Shanghai-based Centre for Safe AGI, which advocates for AI safety, stated that the OpenAI decision has \"caused significant concern within China's AI community.\" This is especially true because the decision \"raises questions about equitable access to AI technologies globally.\"\n\nHowever, it has also generated an opportunity for domestic AI companies, including SenseTime, which are frantically attempting to acquire OpenAI's spurned users. Baidu, a local company, provided 50 million free tokens for its Ernie 3.5 AI model and free migration services after warnings regarding OpenAI's decision were disseminated last month.\n\nZhipu AI, another local company, also provided 150 million free tokens for its model. Tencent Cloud will provide 100 million complimentary tokens for its AI model to new users until the end of July. \"Competitors are offering migration pathways for former OpenAI users, seeing this as an opportunity to expand their user base,\" said Zhu.\n\nOne potential outcome of OpenAI's decision is that it may expedite the development of Chinese AI companies, which are in intense competition with their US counterparts and with one another. China is estimated to have a minimum of 130 large language models, equivalent to 40% of the global population and second only to the United States.\n\nOpenAI's Exit Challenges Chinese AI Firms Amid Price Wars, Prompts Innovation and Self-Reliance\n\nSome analysts have speculated that Chinese companies have been involved in a price war that may impair their ability to innovate and profit margins, even though US companies such as OpenAI have been at the forefront of generative AI. Nevertheless, Winston Ma, a professor at New York University specializing in Chinese technology, stated that OpenAI's departure from China occurs \"when Chinese big tech players are closing the performance gap with OpenAI and are offering these Chinese LLM models essentially free!\"\n\n\"OpenAI's departure is a short-term shock to the China market, but it may provide a long-term opportunity for Chinese domestic LLM models to be put to the real test,\" said Ma. Until now, Chinese companies have focused on the commercialization of large language models rather than advancing the models themselves, he added.\n\nChinese commentators have been eager to dismiss the consequences of OpenAI's decision. The Global Times, a state-owned media outlet, claimed that the United States attempted to impede China's technological advancements. According to Chinese media, Pan Helin, a digital economy researcher at Zhejiang University and member of a government technology committee, characterized the development as \"beneficial for China's self-reliance and independence on a large scale.\"\n\nHowever, there are indications that the United States' restrictions on China's artificial intelligence (AI) sector are beginning to have an impact. According to a report in The Information, the online video colossus Kuaishou was recently compelled to limit the number of individuals who could access its new text-to-video AI model, Kling, due to a shortage of chips, which resulted in a lack of computing capacity. Companies are devising methods to circumvent the sanctions, resulting in a thriving concealed market for US semiconductors. Similar creativity may be stimulated by being denied access to US software.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Microsoft has given up its observer seat on the OpenAI board, eight months after it took the spot following the ousting and quick return of CEO Sam Altman. It's also been reported that Apple will not be taking a similar position. The news comes as regulators further scrutinize the relationship between tech giants and AI startups.\n\nMicrosoft, which has invested $13 billion into OpenAI, took a non-voting observer role on the company's board in November after Sam Altman, who had been fired by the directors days earlier, returned under a new board.\n\nThe Redmond firm said in a letter to OpenAI that its withdrawal from the board would be \"effective immediately.\" It added that it has seen \"significant progress\" over the last eight months, is confident in the company's direction, and no longer sees the seat as necessary.\n\n\"As you know, we accepted the non-voting board observer role at a time when OpenAI was in the process of rebuilding its board,\" Microsoft said in the letter. \"This position provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence, and we appreciated the opportunity to serve as an observer during this period of change.\"\n\nMicrosoft's dealings with OpenAI have caught the attention of regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Commission has warned Microsoft could face an antitrust investigation over its links to the ChatGPT maker, and the UK's competition regulator is also looking at the tie-up. EU antitrust regulators recently confirmed, however, that the partnership would not be subject to merger rules as Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they will be seeking third-party views on the agreement's exclusivity clauses.\n\nThe US, meanwhile, is investigating whether Microsoft properly notified antitrust agencies about its deal with Inflection AI. It's also looking into Microsoft's alleged dominance of the AI market. Other tech giants, including Amazon and Google, are also under the FTC spotlight over their investments in generative AI startups.\n\nApple, which last month announced it was adding ChatGPT to its latest devices, will no longer be taking an observer role on the OpenAI board, something Cupertino was widely expected to do as part of its deal with the company.\n\nAs reported by Reuters, an OpenAI spokesperson said the firm will establish a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.", "source": {"uri": "techspot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_thubron@techspot.com", "name": "Rob Thubron", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/ts3_thumbs/2024/07/2024-07-10-ts3_thumbs-39a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

However, according to a report in the Financial Times citing a knowledgeable source, Apple has decided not to pursue this role. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson mentioned that the company plans to adopt a new approach to engagement. This includes holding regular meetings with key partners like Microsoft and Apple, as well as with investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures. Last November, Microsoft assumed a non-voting observer role on OpenAI's board, following CEO Sam Altman's return to lead the company, which oversees the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT.\n\nThe seat allowed Microsoft to attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information but did not grant voting rights on matters like electing directors. The observer seat, along with Microsoft's investment of over $10 billion in OpenAI, raised concerns among antitrust regulators in Europe, the UK, and the US about the extent of its influence over OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft mentioned that OpenAI's new partnerships, innovations, and expanding customer base since Sam Altman returned to lead the startup were reasons for relinquishing its observer seat.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Untitled-design-10-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 1935, "textEnd": 1941}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The ChatGPT maker plans to update its business partners and investors through regular meetings instead of board representation. The development comes as regulators in the EU and US increase their scrutiny of Big Tech's investments in AI startups.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAxios reports that on Tuesday, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, Keith Dolliver, sent a letter to OpenAI stating that the tech giant's board role was \"no longer necessary\" given the \"significant progress\" made by the newly formed board. Microsoft had accepted a non-voting position on OpenAI's board in November following the ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that Apple's Phil Schiller, who leads the App Store and Apple Events, might join OpenAI's board in an observer role as part of an AI deal. However, the Financial Times now reports that Apple will not take up such a position, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.\n\nInstead of board observer roles, OpenAI plans to host regular meetings with partners such as Microsoft and Apple, as well as investors Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, according to an OpenAI spokesperson who spoke with Financial Times. The decision is part of \"a new approach to informing and engaging key strategic partners\" under Sarah Friar, who came on as OpenAI's first chief financial officer last month.\n\nOpenAI's current eight-person voting board of directors consists of Altman, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former NSA director Paul M. Nakasone, former Sony America President Nicole Seligman, Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, and Instacart CEO Fidji Simo, with former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor serving as chair.\n\nRegulatory pressure intensifies\n\nMicrosoft remains a critical financial and technology resource for OpenAI, having invested over $10 billion in the company since early 2023. The partnership has given Microsoft early access to leading generative AI models (although the value of that in the long term remains to be seen) while providing OpenAI with Microsoft computing muscle that powers both new AI model training runs and services like ChatGPT.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWhile no official source has yet officially linked Microsoft's board withdrawal (and Apple's change of direction on a potential OpenAI board position) to regulatory scrutiny, it's unlikely to be a coincidence. Regulators in both the US and Europe are worried that Big Tech's heavy influence in fast-growing AI startups may unreasonably edge out competition and establish de facto monopolies over key technologies that would stifle smaller competitors.\n\nIn June, the FTC began looking into investments made by Big Tech companies (such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google) into generative AI startups. Meanwhile, the European Commission also announced it was exploring the possibility of an antitrust investigation into the Microsoft/OpenAI partnership after deciding not to proceed with a probe under merger control rules.\n\nEven though Microsoft's financial ties run deep into OpenAI, as Financial Times notes, the ChatGPT maker states: \"While our partnership with Microsoft includes a multibillion dollar investment, OpenAI remains an entirely independent company governed by the OpenAI Nonprofit.\"", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors":

amid regulator scrutiny", "body": "Brussels (Belgium) (AFP) - Microsoft has ditched plans to take up an observer seat on the board of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, according to a letter seen by AFP on Wednesday, as antitrust regulators step up their scrutiny of the artificial intelligence market.\n\nMicrosoft's $13-billion tie-up with OpenAI has raised concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about just how much influence it has over its smaller partner.\n\nRegulators began examining the partnership after an abortive boardroom coup last year against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whom Microsoft supported and even briefly hired.\n\nIt was after the turmoil in OpenAI that Microsoft got a seat on the board as a non-voting observer that it is now giving up.\n\nMicrosoft's withdrawal is \"effective immediately\", the letter said.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" Microsoft wrote to OpenAI in the letter sent on Tuesday.\n\n\"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's influential antitrust regulator, last month concluded after a preliminary examination that Microsoft's investment did not mean it had taken control of OpenAI.\n\nBut Microsoft was still under examination over the observer seat on the board from British competition regulators, and faced a potential antitrust probe in the United States.\n\nWhen OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot hit the scene in November 2022, it marked the popular arrival of the AI revolution.\n\nMedia reports said Apple had similarly given up the chance to sit on OpenAI's board, but the iPhone maker was not immediately available for comment.\n\nEU competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, has put big tech on alert over investments in the fast-growing AI market and insisted that the EU continues to keep an eye over the sector.\n\nBrussels is now seeking more information from Microsoft about the agreement with OpenAI, Vestager said on June 28, to understand whether \"certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative effect on competition\".", "source":

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nEven though OpenAI is taking steps to restrict access in China to its platform, a fresh report claims that users in the country can still access the firm's products by using Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform. Microsoft and OpenAI have a close partnership which has seen the former gain unparalleled access to its products in the bid to expand enterprise computing through artificial intelligence features. The latest report comes courtesy of The Information, and the publication claims that it has talked with multiple Chinese customers who can use OpenAI's conversational AI models.\n\nToday's report follows OpenAI's announcement late last month that it would restrict Chinese customers from using its API starting July 9th. Unlike ChatGPT, which is a finished end product offered by OpenAI and its partners, the firm's API allows customers to use OpenAI's technologies to develop their own products. Essentially, it offers them the ability to layer additional software over OpenAI's program to create use case specific products that ChatGPT cannot cater to.\n\nThe free portion of The Information's report shares that while OpenAI is restricting Chinese users from using its API, Microsoft's Chinese customers can still access \"OpenAI's conversational AI models.\" It goes on to add that these models are available to enterprise customers that use the Azure cloud computing platform as part of Azure's OpenAI service in China. According to the publication, it was able to confirm with three Chinese businesses \"that they have access to OpenAI's models.\"\n\nMicrosoft's Azure OpenAI enables users to integrate their data and run custom queries with artificial intelligence language and image models. Along with OpenAI, it also offers products from Facebook's parent Meta as part of its artificial intelligence portfolio for a diverse, off the shelf customizable AI platform.\n\nAfter OpenAI's announcement last month, Microsoft confirmed that it would continue to offer Azure OpenAI services to users in Hong Kong. OpenAI remains unsupported in Chinese territory and mainland China; by the looks of it, Microsoft has adopted a policy similar to that of its Hong Kong operations on the mainland. OpenAI pays Microsoft to offer its services on Azure, and it also pays a commission to the software giant out of its API revenue. Reports have also indicated that Microsoft has a right to the lion's share of OpenAI's profits until the latter can pay back its investor's multi billion dollar investment.\n\nOpenAI's popular chatbot service ChatGPT is already banned in China, where authorities exercise strict control over the public's access to information. Chinese residents cannot access ChatGPT without workarounds as part of the government's efforts to control what it deems as propaganda. At the same time, the government has also approved more than a hundred local large language models in a bid to develop a local AI industry.\n\nHowever, given the US's extensive chip restrictions, which also target AI chips, training these models should prove to be difficult for Chinese companies. Models such as ChatGPT require tens of thousands of the latest GPUs for their processing power, and a large portion of NVIDIA's $3.15 trillion market capitalization hinges on the fact that its products are industry leaders in AI performance.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramish_zafar@wccftech.com", "name": "Ramish Zafar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainland China"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-27-at-1.28.03-AM-740x431.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 864, "textEnd": 872}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The resignation also means OpenAI no longer has an observer seat on its board.\n\nMicrosoft took a seat on the OpenAI board in November following a chaotic period at the firm, which resulted in CEO Sam Altman's abrupt sacking.

In June, both firms announced a deal to integrate ChatGPT into Apple's devices. After Microsoft's departure, OpenAI is not planning on having an observer seat again on its board, according to an Axios report citing sources familiar with the developments.\n\nMicrosoft's departure comes amid growing pressure from antitrust regulators who are scrutinizing big tech firms' investments in AI startups.

Microsoft executive Dee Templeton has been a non-voting board member of OpenAI since the beginning of the year, while Apple executive Phil Schiller was reportedly set to join as a non-voting observer later in 2024.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

In order to continue to keep its partners informed on the organization's inner workings, OpenAI will instead begin hosting regular meetings with the two companies.\n\nMicrosoft is OpenAI's largest investor, having funneled some $13 billion into the company. Their partnership, which began five years ago, integrates OpenAI's A.I. technology into Microsoft products and sees Microsoft provide computing power for OpenAI. Despite Microsoft's major investment, OpenAI maintains that it \"remains an entirely independent company.\" It currently operates as a nonprofit that runs a capped-profit subsidiary from which Microsoft is entitled to receive a percentage of profit -- although OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is reportedly looking to restructure the entire organization into a fully for-profit model.\n\nIn November, Microsoft was shocked when Altman was briefly ousted by OpenAI's board. Shortly after Altman was reinstated as CEO and a new board was formed, it received a non-voting observer board role to remain better informed on the company's decision-making. But in yesterday's letter to OpenAI, written by Microsoft's deputy general counsel Keith Dolliver, the company said that although the position \"provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence,\" the role was no longer \"necessary\" and reiterated its confidence in OpenAI's direction, according to the Financial Times.\n\nWhy the change of heart?\n\nThe withdrawal comes amid heightened scrutiny around Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, which has boosted the Big Tech company's profits and market cap. The European Commission, which previously dropped a review into whether the entanglement broke European Union merger rules, is currently weighing whether the two companies warrant an antitrust examination; while the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority is reviewing whether the partnership has resulted in \"an acquisition of control.\" The Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., too, is currently examining whether OpenAI and Microsoft have violated antitrust laws.\n\nWhile Apple might not yet be facing the same levels of scrutiny when it comes to A.I. regulation, it recently formalized its ties with OpenAI with a partnership that will see the latest version of ChatGPT integrated across Apple devices. While it was revealed earlier this month that Apple's Schiller would join OpenAI's board to further strengthen the relationship between the two companies, Apple has since decided to back out.\n\nWith both Microsoft and Apple no longer privy to board meetings, OpenAI going forward will pursue a different method to keep its key partners informed. Microsoft and Apple, in addition to OpenAI investors like Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, will now participate in meetings with the company. \"Moving forward, we will host regular stakeholder meetings to share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security,\" said an OpenAI spokesperson in a statement to the Guardian. \"We look forward to continuing to receive feedback and advice from these key stakeholders.\"", "source": {"uri": "observer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexandra_tremayne_pengelly@observer.com", "name": "Alexandra Tremayne-Pengelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terms of service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition and Markets Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1778706504.jpg?quality=80&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 949, "textEnd": 955}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The cloud computing and software giant is said to have given up the role on Tuesday. Apple, for its part, was likewise expected to become a board observer but has reportedly reversed course.\n\nThe development comes at a time when OpenAI is facing scrutiny from antitrust regulators in both the US and the European Union. The artificial intelligence provider's partnership with Microsoft is reportedly a particular focus. Microsoft has provided OpenAI with about $13 billion worth of funding and cloud infrastructure in exchange for a share of its profits, as well as the possibility of a future 49% stake.\n\nIn early June, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Federal Trade Commission is looking into the companies' partnership. The FTC is reportedly concerned that Microsoft may have structured the deal to give it control of OpenAI without drawing regulatory attention. Later that month, the European Union's top competition official revealed that the bloc may launch a probe into the companies over \"certain exclusivity clauses\" in their partnership agreement.\n\nMicrosoft took an observer seat on OpenAI's board last December following the brief ouster of Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman. After Altman returned to the top post, the directors who had voted to fire him left the company and the board was restructured. Microsoft reportedly played a key role in securing Altman's reinstatement.\n\nKeith Dolliver, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, informed OpenAI of the company's plan to exit the board in a letter sent late Tuesday. \"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" the executive wrote. \"Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said that \"we're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.\"\n\nAbout a week before Microsoft's letter, Bloomberg cited sources as saying that Apple planned to take an observer seat on OpenAI's board. The iPhone maker was reportedly set to receive the position as part of a partnership it had announced with the AI developer in June. According to the Financial Times, the iPhone maker no longer plans to join the board.\n\nApple's collaboration with OpenAI will see it use ChatGPT to power parts of Apple Intelligence, an upcoming set of AI features for iPhones and Macs. Some of the ChatGPT-powered capabilities are set to become available in the iPhone maker's document and image editing tools.

while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Britain's competition watchdog have also been examining the pact.\n\nMicrosoft took the board seat following a power struggle in which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman

will no longer have observer seats on its board.\n\n\"We are grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our

companies and their links with AI startups, said Alex Haffner, a competition partner at U.K. law firm Fladgate.\n\n\"It is clear that regulators are very much focused on the complex web of inter-relationships that Big Tech has created with AI providers, hence the need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward,\" he said.\n\nOpenAI said it would take a new approach to \"informing and engaging key strategic partners\" such as Microsoft and Apple and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, with regular meetings to

Why trust us?\n\nBarely a week after news broke that Apple Fellow Phil Schiller would join the OpenAI board in a non-voting observer role, Financial Times reports that the two companies are nixing that plan to avoid potential antitrust scrutiny.\n\nSchiller, who heads Apple's App store and Apple Events, as well as formerly served as the company's chief marketer, will instead reportedly receive regular meetings with the AI startup, along with other partners and investors, including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nOpenAI currently has an eight-member board that includes former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and most recently, former National Security Agency (NSA) director Paul M. Nakasone. Per Bloomberg, the observer role \"allows someone to attend board meetings without being able to vote or exercise other director powers. Observers, however, do gain insights into how decisions are made at the company.\"\n\nSchiller was reportedly going to join the board in that capacity as the result of a potential AI partnership between the two companies wherein Apple would host OpenAI's models as part of its upcoming Apple Intelligence service.\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI's biggest financial backer (which has invested more than $10 billion in the startup since 2023), was also previously offered a similar board position. However, as Axios reported Tuesday, Microsoft has reportedly seen \"significant progress\" from OpenAI in the months since Altman's attempted ouster last November, which prompted Microsoft's initial push for the position. As a result, it no longer sees the observer role as a necessity.\n\n\"We appreciate the support shown by OpenAI leadership and the OpenAI board as we made this decision,\" Microsoft wrote in a letter shared with Axios. \"As you know, we accepted the non-voting board observer role at a time when OpenAI was in the process of rebuilding its board. This position provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence, and we appreciated the opportunity to serve as an observer during this period of change.\"\n\nBoth moves come as European and U.S. regulators intensify their investigations into potential antitrust violations surrounding Apple and Microsoft's dominant positions within the AI market, which could push out smaller firms and create monopoly conditions for these larger companies. Microsoft is already under investigation by U.S. regulators for its sizable investment into OpenAI, as well as by British competition regulators over the observer seat itself.\n\nIn response, an OpenAI representative told Financial Times, \"While our partnership with Microsoft includes a multibillion-dollar investment, OpenAI remains an entirely independent company governed by the OpenAI Nonprofit.\"", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_tarantola@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Andrew Tarantola", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Schiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS/iPadOS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "App Store (iOS/iPadOS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Summers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Trends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital Trends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ChatGPT-OpenAI-logo.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

"body": "Microsoft has ditched plans to take up a non-voting position on the board of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, according to a letter seen by AFP on Wednesday, as regulators step up scrutiny of deals involving AI companies.\n\nMicrosoft's $13-billion tie-up with OpenAI has raised concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about just how much influence the tech giant has over its smaller partner.\n\nIts early investment in OpenAI has made Microsoft a market leader in AI.\n\nWhen ChatGPT hit the scene in November 2022, it marked the popular arrival of the AI revolution as the chatbot dazzled users with its ability to churn out eloquent text in seconds.\n\nBut regulators began examining the partnership after a failed boardroom coup last year against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman -- whom Microsoft supported and even briefly hired.\n\nAfter the turmoil in OpenAI, Microsoft got a seat on the board as a non-voting observer that it is now giving up.\n\nMicrosoft's withdrawal is \"effective immediately\", according to a letter sent from the company to OpenAI on Tuesday.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" the letter stated.\n\n\"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nThe EU last month concluded after a preliminary examination that Microsoft's investment did not mean it had taken control of OpenAI.\n\nBrussels is however now seeking more information from Microsoft about the agreement with OpenAI to understand whether \"certain exclusivity clauses\" could harm competition.\n\nMicrosoft is also under examination over its ties to OpenAI by British competition regulators, and faced a potential antitrust probe in the United States.\n\n\"It is hard not to conclude that Microsoft's decision has been heavily influenced by the ongoing competition/antitrust scrutiny,\" said Alex Haffner, a competition lawyer, at Fladgate law firm.\n\nMedia reports said Apple had similarly given up the chance to sit on OpenAI's board, but the iPhone maker was not immediately available for comment.\n\nApple had been due to get a seat after partnering with OpenAI for a suite of new AI features on its popular devices -- rolling out soon in markets outside the EU.\n\nThe bloc's competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, has put big tech on alert over investments in the fast-growing AI market and insisted that the EU continues to keep an eye over the sector.\n\nWith regulators focused on \"the complex web of inter-relationships that big tech has created with AI providers\", lawyer Haffner said there was a \"need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward\".\n\nAnother phenomenon in the AI market in the EU's crosshairs is so-called \"acqui-hires\" -- when a company acquires another firm mainly to grab its key talent -- with Brussels racing to understand if it distorts competition.\n\nMicrosoft earlier this year announced a deal to hire senior figures from OpenAI rival Inflection, including its boss, to head up a newly created consumer AI unit.\n\nBut unlike a merger, Inflection still operates as an independent company and such a move by Microsoft means it avoids a traditional merger probe.\n\nRegulators have the right to block mergers if there are fears of damage to competition.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raziye_akkoc@ibtimes.com.au", "name": "Raziye Akkoc",

Instead, the company will hold regular meetings with OpenAI to discuss collaborative interests.\n\nThe Financial Times explains that this observer role would have granted Schiller a non-voting position at OpenAI's board meetings, providing Apple with insights into OpenAI's strategic plans without direct control.\n\nBy opting for regular meetings over a formal board position, Apple aims to sidestep any antitrust issues that might arise from having a seat on the board of a prominent AI company.\n\nMicrosoft, a major investor in OpenAI, has also given up its observer seat on the AI company's board.\n\nThis decision was communicated in a letter to OpenAI, stating that the withdrawal was effective immediately. Microsoft's involvement with OpenAI includes a massive $13 billion investment, crucial for OpenAI's access to computing power and cloud storage.\n\nThe observer role for Microsoft came into existence after a tumultuous period last year when OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the board, only to be reinstated shortly after. This role allowed Microsoft to stay informed about board activities without compromising its independence.\n\nKeith Dolliver, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, explained in his letter that their position allowed them to gain insights into the board's activities while maintaining its independence.\n\nHe noted that since then, they have observed substantial progress from the newly established board and feel confident about the company's trajectory.\n\nRead Also: Apple Unveils iPhone 16 Pro Specs and AI Integration With Major Updates in Battery Tech and Messages App\n\nThe decisions by Apple and Microsoft come as antitrust authorities in the European Union and the United States intensify their scrutiny of Big Tech's investments in AI start-ups.\n\nThe European Commission has been exploring the possibility of an antitrust investigation into the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI, while the US Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have also begun examining these investments.\n\nIn response to these regulatory pressures, OpenAI has adopted a new approach to engaging with its strategic partners. Instead of board seats, the organization will now host regular meetings with key partners, including Microsoft, Apple, Thrive Capital, and Khosla Ventures.\n\nOpenAI's eight-member board continues to include influential figures such as Sam Altman, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and Instacart CEO Fidji Simo, with Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of Salesforce, serving as chairman.\n\nStay posted here at Tech Times.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_lopez@techtimes.com", "name": "John Lopez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salesforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salesforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instacart", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instacart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Summers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://1734811051.rsc.cdn77.org/data/thumbs/full/449363/820/0/0/0/germany-us-internet-ai-artificial-intelligence.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft's $13 billion investment and integration of OpenAI's tech in products like Windows face antitrust probes. Despite withdrawing, concerns about stifling competition persist. US and European regulators are scrutinizing Big Tech's dominance in AI. Analysts foresee AWS and Google becoming preferred partners amid growing demand and regulatory pressure. This move underscores challenges as tech giants balance innovation and regulatory compliance in the AI landscape.Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. dropped plans to take board roles at OpenAI in a surprise decision that underscores growing regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech's influence over artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft, which invested $13 billion in the ChatGPT creator, will withdraw from its observer role on the board, the company said in a letter to OpenAI on Tuesday, which was seen by Bloomberg News. Apple was\n\ndue to take up a similar role, but an OpenAI spokesperson said the startup won't have board observers after Microsoft's departure.\n\nRegulators in the US and Europe had expressed concerns about Microsoft's sway over OpenAI, applying pressure on one of the world's most valuable companies to show that it's keeping the relationship at\n\narm's length. Microsoft has integrated OpenAI's services into its Windows and Copilot AI platforms and, like other big US tech companies, is banking on the new technology to help drive growth.\n\nStill, the board resignation is unlikely to resolve the US Federal Trade Commission's concerns about Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, a source familiar with the agency's thinking said. Other regulators will\n\nlikely feel similarly because the change doesn't alter Microsoft's close ties to the startup, analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence said in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\"Microsoft 'giving up' its OpenAI board seat is just another gambit on the chessboard,\" said Foxglove director Cori Crider, whose law firm is pushing for more antitrust scrutiny of the relationship. \"Big Tech know they're in a cat-and-mouse game with antitrust enforcers over AI.\" The Financial Times reported Microsoft's exit earlier.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\n\nThe move by Microsoft and Apple to opt out as observers from the OpenAI board may be driven by regulatory pressure, but we don't see this lessening their influence over the latter's product strategy or ending\n\nthe antitrust investigations. In the longer term, we see other cloud providers such as AWS or even Google to be preferred vendors for OpenAI as demand increases and it faces more scrutiny globally.\n\n-- Justin Teresi, BI Litigation Analyst and Anurag Rana BI Technology\n\nAnalyst AI Scrutiny\n\nMicrosoft is facing broader scrutiny over its alleged dominance of artificial intelligence. In January, the US Federal Trade Commission said it was looking into Microsoft's investment in OpenAI as part of a\n\nbroader inquiry into Big Tech companies and their partnerships with AI startups. Separately, the US is looking at whether the company properly notified antitrust agencies about its deal with an OpenAI rival,\n\nInflection AI, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nEuropean regulators also said they were going to survey Microsoft's rivals about OpenAI's exclusive use of its technology, and the UK's competition regulator is weighing a deeper investigation of the tie up.\n\nMicrosoft isn't being singled out. The UK is also looking into Amazon.com Inc.'s $4 billion collaboration with AI company Anthropic, expressing concern that large tech companies are using partnerships to \"shield themselves from competition.\" The US is probing Nvidia Corp.'s dominance over AI chips.\n\nMicrosoft shares rose 0.4% to $461.38 at 11:31 a.m. in New York trading. Apple gained 1.1% to $231.19.\n\nBig Tech Investments\n\nThe biggest US tech companies including Microsoft as well as Nvidia, Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com have poured tens of billions of dollars into AI businesses. While these investments and partnerships are a\n\nlifeline for the startups, regulators have expressed concern that they threaten to concentrate access to the most innovative large language models among the tech companies that already dominate other platforms.\n\nTech giants are also striking non-financial agreements. These include Apple's partnership with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to the iPhone, and Microsoft's decision earlier this year to bring on Inflection AI's Mustafa Suleyman and most of his staff from the OpenAI rival.\n\nMicrosoft took on the non-voting observer role on OpenAI's board last year, weeks after the startup's directors had fired Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman in a dramatic coup over the direction of the company.\n\nAltman was quickly reinstated following a backlash from employees and the board was remade.\n\n\"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,\" OpenAI said in a statement to Bloomberg News,\n\nwithout commenting directly on Apple or Microsoft's decisions.\n\nOpenAI said that moving forward, the company will host regular stakeholder meetings with partners and investors, including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, \"to share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security.\"\n\nOpenAI began in 2015 as a nonprofit research organization, but later shifted its structure to include a for-profit startup that has solicited investments and struck commercial partnerships.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman -- whom Microsoft supported and even briefly hired.\n\nAfter the turmoil in OpenAI, Microsoft got a seat on the board as a non-voting observer that it is now giving up.\n\nMicrosoft's withdrawal is \"effective immediately\", according to a letter sent from the company to OpenAI on Tuesday.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" the letter stated.\n\n\"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nThe EU last month concluded after a preliminary examination that Microsoft's investment did not mean it had taken control of OpenAI.\n\nBrussels is however now seeking more information from Microsoft about the agreement with OpenAI to understand whether \"certain exclusivity clauses\" could harm competition.\n\nMicrosoft is also under examination over its ties to OpenAI by British competition regulators, and faced a potential antitrust probe in the United States.\n\n\"It is hard not to conclude that Microsoft's decision has been heavily influenced by the ongoing competition/antitrust scrutiny,\" said Alex Haffner, a competition lawyer, at Fladgate law firm.\n\nMore scrutiny\n\nMedia reports said Apple had similarly given up the chance to sit on OpenAI's board, but the iPhone maker was not immediately available for comment.\n\nApple had been due to get a seat after partnering with OpenAI for a suite of new AI features on its popular devices -- rolling out soon in markets outside the EU.\n\nThe bloc's competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, has put big tech on alert over investments in the fast-growing AI market and insisted that the EU continues to keep an eye over the sector.\n\nWith regulators focused on \"the complex web of inter-relationships that big tech has created with AI providers\", lawyer Haffner said there was a \"need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward\".\n\nAnother phenomenon in the AI market in the EU's crosshairs is so-called \"acqui-hires\" -- when a company acquires another firm mainly to grab its key talent -- with Brussels racing to understand if it distorts competition.\n\nMicrosoft earlier this year announced a deal to hire senior figures from OpenAI rival Inflection, including its boss, to head up a newly created consumer AI unit.\n\nBut unlike a merger, Inflection still operates as an independent company and such a move by Microsoft means it avoids a traditional merger probe.\n\nRegulators have the right to block mergers if there are fears of damage to competition.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [],

Microsoft's Deputy General Counsel Keith Dolliver, in a letter to OpenAI, said the seat was no longer needed as the company had witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board.\n\nFurther, Apple, which was planning to join the Board following its recent AI development deal, is said to be no longer taking the Board seat. At the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Apple announced its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into iOS 18. As part of the collaboration, Phil Schiller, the former marketing head and chief of the App Store at Apple, was selected to have an observer role on OpenAI's board, and was expected to join later this year .\n\nConfirming that Microsoft has given up its seat, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe reportedly said, \"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership. Under the leadership of CFO Sarah Friar, we are establishing a new approach to informing and engaging key strategic partners - such as Microsoft and Apple - and investors - such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\"\n\nThe new approach by OpenAI is said to involve regular stakeholder meetings with Microsoft and Apple to share progress on its mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security.\n\nMicrosoft took the non-voting board seat at OpenAI during the troubling period of the startup last year, when its co-founder Sam Altman was ousted from the Board and as CEO after alleging that he was not consistently candid in his communications. Altman rejoined as CEO few days later, and also to the board after an independent Special Committee investigation found that his conduct did not mandate removal.\n\nThe news comes as the European Commission recently said Microsoft could face an antitrust investigation as the regulator was looking into some of the deals between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers to find the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics. The Commission in January said it was checking whether Microsoft's investment in OpenAI might be reviewable under the EU Merger Regulation.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "source": {"uri": "nasdaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NASDAQ Stock Market"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS/iPadOS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "App Store (iOS/iPadOS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Schiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/rttnews_article/apple-10072024-m.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft, which had heavily invested in OpenAI, including a notable USD 13 billion investment in its AI technology ChatGPT, has announced its immediate withdrawal from its observer role on OpenAI's board.\n\nThe decision was communicated through a letter to OpenAI, citing the company's satisfaction with the progress made by the newly formed board. Similarly, Apple, which was expected to take up an observer role as part of a deal to integrate ChatGPT into its devices, has decided against doing so.\n\nWhile Apple declined to comment, sources suggest it will not be taking an observer position on OpenAI's board. In light of these changes, OpenAI has introduced a revised strategy for engaging with strategic partners and investors.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times report, OpenAI plans to hold regular meetings with partners such as Microsoft and Apple, alongside investors like Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures. This new approach aims to encourage a more inclusive and collaborative governance structure, stated an OpenAI spokesperson.\n\nRecently, Phil Schiller, former Apple marketing chief, was added as an observer on OpenAI's board just days before these withdrawals. However, Schiller will no longer be observing OpenAI's operations, underscoring the fluid dynamics within the organization.\n\nAnalysts speculate that Microsoft's and Apple's decisions to withdraw from their observer roles could be driven by strategic considerations or internal dynamics within OpenAI.

- Microsoft has ditched plans to take up a non-voting position on the board of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, according to a letter seen by AFP on Wednesday, as regulators step up scrutiny of deals involving AI companies.\n\nMicrosoft's $13-billion tie-up with OpenAI has raised concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about just how much influence the tech giant has over its smaller partner.\n\nIts early investment in OpenAI has made Microsoft a market leader in AI.\n\nWhen ChatGPT hit the scene in November 2022, it marked the popular arrival of the AI revolution as the chatbot dazzled users with its ability to churn out eloquent text in seconds.\n\nBut regulators began examining the partnership after a failed boardroom coup last year against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman -- whom Microsoft supported and even briefly hired.\n\nAfter the turmoil in OpenAI, Microsoft got a seat on the board as a non-voting observer that it is now giving up.\n\nMicrosoft's withdrawal is \"effective immediately\", according to a letter sent from the company to OpenAI on Tuesday.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" the letter stated.\n\n\"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nThe EU last month concluded after a preliminary examination that Microsoft's investment did not mean it had taken control of OpenAI.\n\nBrussels is however now seeking more information from Microsoft about the agreement with OpenAI to understand whether \"certain exclusivity clauses\" could harm competition.\n\nMicrosoft is also under examination over its ties to OpenAI by British competition regulators, and faced a potential antitrust probe in the United States.\n\n\"It is hard not to conclude that Microsoft's decision has been heavily influenced by the ongoing competition/antitrust scrutiny,\" said Alex Haffner, a competition lawyer, at Fladgate law firm.\n\n- More scrutiny -\n\nMedia reports said Apple had similarly given up the chance to sit on OpenAI's board, but the iPhone maker was not immediately available for comment.\n\nApple had been due to get a seat after partnering with OpenAI for a suite of new AI features on its popular devices -- rolling out soon in markets outside the EU.\n\nThe bloc's competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, has put big tech on alert over investments in the fast-growing AI market and insisted that the EU continues to keep an eye over the sector.\n\nWith regulators focused on \"the complex web of inter-relationships that big tech has created with AI providers\", lawyer Haffner said there was a \"need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward\".\n\nAnother phenomenon in the AI market in the EU's crosshairs is so-called \"acqui-hires\" -- when a company acquires another firm mainly to grab its key talent -- with Brussels racing to understand if it distorts competition.\n\nMicrosoft earlier this year announced a deal to hire senior figures from OpenAI rival Inflection, including its boss, to head up a newly created consumer AI unit.\n\nBut unlike a merger, Inflection still operates as an independent company and such a move by Microsoft means it avoids a traditional merger probe.\n\nRegulators have the right to block mergers if there are fears of damage to competition.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT",

Originally granted last year by OpenAI in the wake of the abrupt firing and re-hiring of its founder and chief executive, Sam Altman, the big tech firm said in a letter to OpenAI that it no longer needed to keep the seat as governance at the startup had substantially improved since then.\n\n\"This position provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence,\" wrote Microsoft's deputy chief counsel Keith Dolliver. However, eight months on after the attempted coup against Altman at OpenAI, \"we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\" The seat is now vacant, with the Financial Times reporting that Apple - after announcing its own partnership with OpenAI last month - refusing to assume Microsoft's old position.\n\nThe gift of an observer board seat to Microsoft was, in part, a testament to the close relationship between OpenAI's chief executive Sam Altman and the Redmond-based firm's chief, Satya Nadella, with the latter going as far as to offer Altman a role at Microsoft during his brief hiatus from his startup. The partnership, which has seen Microsoft invest billions into OpenAI, has resulted in several market-leading AI innovations such as the former's Copilot service.\n\nSince then, however, multiple regulators have become increasingly critical about how that partnership may serve to inhibit competition within the overall marketplace for generative AI products. In June, the US Federal Trade Commission launched a probe into whether Microsoft and OpenAI's relationship broke antitrust laws. In December 2023, meanwhile, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) mounted its own inquiry. Five months later, the watchdog's chief executive Sarah Cardell said that both Microsoft and Nvidia were two of six large firms that dominated the AI value chain through an \"interconnected web\" of 90 investments and partnerships.\n\nThese companies, argued Cardell, \"already hold positions of market power in many of today's most important digital markets [and] could profoundly shape these new markets to the detriment of fair, open and effective competition, ultimately harming businesses and consumers.\" The CMA's probe into Microsoft and OpenAI is ongoing, with some speculating that a Phase I investigation is likely to commence later this year.\n\nThis is not the first time Microsoft has seemingly attempted to stave off regulators' ire over its partnership with OpenAI. In December, after Microsoft announced its investment of $13bn into the firm, it did so as part of a deal that would see it receive limited profits from an OpenAI subsidiary. Redmond stressed, however, that it did not \"own any portion of OpenAI\" as part of this arrangement.\n\nThough Microsoft has decided to give up its observer seat on its board, OpenAI stressed that its relationship with the big tech firm would remain close. A spokesperson told the FT that OpenAI would instead consult with Microsoft and other major investors through regular meetings, as part of a \"new approach to informing and engaging key strategic partners.\"", "source": {"uri": "techmonitor.ai", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition and Markets Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/02/shutterstock_2410535415.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Rattled by the antics at OpenAI and the impact on its multibillion-dollar investment in the company, Microsoft took the seat to keep tabs on things.\n\nA European Commission review has since cleared Microsoft of trying to exert control over OpenAI. However, regulators are continuing to examine the company's behavior amid worries over the impact on competition of OpenAI and Microsoft's partnership.\n\nMicrosoft's relationship with OpenAI and the billions it has invested into the company has also come under scrutiny by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as well as the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nWhile the European Commission opted not to pursue a review of the partnership under EU merger rules, the CMA's review is ongoing. Microsoft's decision to drop its non-voting observer seat means it has one less thing to defend regarding its relationship with OpenAI.\n\nIn the withdrawal letter seen by The Register, Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel at Microsoft, wrote: \"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\"\n\n\"This position provided insights into the board's transitional work without compromising its independence,\" he added.\n\nFollowing Microsoft's investment in OpenAI, the tech giant has gained an apparent early lead in the generative AI race and enjoyed increased earnings.\n\nAfter Apple's announcement that it would support OpenAI's ChatGPT in its products, the company was expected to take an observer seat on the board. However, according to reports, it has since elected not to.\n\nAlex Haffner, a competition partner at law firm Fladgate, told The Reg: \"It is hard not to conclude that Microsoft's decision has been heavily influenced by the ongoing competition/antitrust scrutiny of its (and other major tech players) influence over emerging AI players such as Open AI.\"\n\nHaffner observed that Microsoft had scored a \"win\" at the end of June with the European Commission dropping the merger control probe of Microsoft and OpenAI. However, he pointed out that regulators were still looking at the impact on AI competition of arrangements made by big tech.\n\n\"It is clear that regulators are very much focused on the complex web of inter-relationships that big tech has created with AI providers, hence the need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward,\" said Haffner. \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition and Markets Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Register", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://regmedia.co.uk/2017/06/12/empty-conference-room.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Microsoft was instrumental in facilitating Altman's return and the reconfiguration of the board.\n\nCurrently, the board features new members such as Bret Taylor as chairman and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, alongside Adam D'Angelo, who remains from the previous board lineup. New board inductees include Instacart CEO Fidji Simo, ex-Sony Corp EVP Nicole Seligman, former Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, and ex-NSA head Paul Nakasone.\n\nIn a communication to OpenAI, Microsoft declared its immediate withdrawal from the board observer role. The tech company thanked OpenAI's leadership for their cooperation during the transitional period. They highlighted that the observer role offered valuable oversight while maintaining board autonomy. With significant progress now achieved, Microsoft believes the role is no longer necessary.\n\nMicrosoft retains a 49% stake in the for-profit OpenAI, with investments totaling nearly $13 billion. The OpenAI-Microsoft partnership has attracted scrutiny from EU antitrust regulators, with Margrethe Vestager, EU's executive vice-president for competition policy, voicing concerns about large tech firms potentially gaining control over other companies through such investments.\n\nContrary to previous reports, Apple will not be taking a seat on OpenAI's board, The Financial Times has revealed. It was anticipated that Apple would assume an observer role on OpenAI's board as a part of the agreement to incorporate ChatGPT into its devices; however, this will not proceed, as stated by an individual with firsthand knowledge of the situation. Apple has chosen not to issue a statement on the matter.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson stated to The Verge that the company will host regular meetings with partners, including Microsoft and Apple, as well as investors like Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures. This initiative is part of \"a new approach to informing and engaging key strategic partners\" led by Sarah Friar, the newly appointed chief financial officer and former CEO of Nextdoor, who joined last month.\n\nPost Microsoft's departure from the observer position, OpenAI doesn't intend to appoint new observers to its board, as per sources familiar with the strategy. This decision could alleviate antitrust anxieties linked to Microsoft's deep involvement with OpenAI. OpenAI acknowledged Microsoft's faith in its governance and is set to formulate new strategies for engaging key strategic partners and investors, like Microsoft and Apple.\n\nUnder CFO Sarah Friar's supervision, OpenAI is crafting an approach to keep strategic partners and investors, including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, informed and engaged.\n\nMicrosoft's decision aligns with OpenAI's recent collaboration with Apple, which allows iPhone and Mac users to use Siri for ChatGPT queries.

"Microsoft gives up OpenAI board seat amid regulator scrutiny", "body": "Microsoft has ditched plans to take up an observer seat on the board of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, according to a letter seen by AFP on Wednesday, as antitrust regulators step up their scrutiny of the artificial intelligence market.\n\nMicrosoft's $13-billion tie-up with OpenAI has raised concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about just how much influence it has over its smaller partner.\n\nRegulators began examining the partnership after an abortive boardroom coup last year against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whom Microsoft supported and even briefly hired.\n\nIt was after the turmoil in OpenAI that Microsoft got a seat on the board as a non-voting observer that it is now giving up.\n\nMicrosoft's withdrawal is \"effective immediately\", the letter said.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" Microsoft wrote to OpenAI in the letter sent on Tuesday.\n\n\"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nMore from this section Raebareli: MP Rahul Gandhi Offers Prayers at Hanuman Temple after Returning from Manipur Carlsberg quaffs British soft drinks maker Britvic for \u00a33.3 bn Joe Biden criticised for 'Trump-like ego' as President continues to deny ill health: 'He's lying to us!'\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's influential antitrust regulator, last month concluded after a preliminary examination that Microsoft's investment did not mean it had taken control of OpenAI.\n\nBut Microsoft was still under examination over the observer seat on the board from British competition regulators, and faced a potential antitrust probe in the United States.\n\nWhen OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot hit the scene in November 2022, it marked the popular arrival of the AI revolution.\n\nMedia reports said Apple had similarly given up the chance to sit on OpenAI's board, but the iPhone maker was not immediately available for comment.\n\nEU competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, has put big tech on alert over investments in the fast-growing AI market and insisted that the EU continues to keep an eye over the sector.\n\nBrussels is now seeking more information from Microsoft about the agreement with OpenAI, Vestager said on June 28, to understand whether \"certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative effect on competition\".\n\nraz/ec/rl", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Similarly, Microsoft put an observer in place following 2023's chaotic ousting and then re-hiring of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAccording to multiple sources including the Financial Times, however, Microsoft has now withdrawn its observer. A source said to have direct knowledge of the matter, says that Apple will no longer take an observer board position.\n\nThe move by both Apple and Microsoft is believed to be related to scrutiny by global regulators. In particular, authorities in both the US and the European Union are reportedly examining OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft.\n\nApple has not confirmed that it will no longer take a seat on the board, nor commented on the report. Microsoft announced its move through a letter to OpenAI, notifying the company that its withdrawal from the board would be \"effective immediately.\"\n\nA spokesperson for OpenAI said that instead of having observers on the board, the firm would host regular meetings with its partners. Those partners include Apple, Microsoft, and investment companies Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\n\nRegarding regulation, OpenAI's Sam Altman has previously said AI was at risk of being over-regulated, particular by the EU.

"Microsoft drops OpenAI board seat as scrunity increases", "body": "Microsoft has ditched plans to take up a non-voting position on the board of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, according to a letter seen by AFP on Wednesday, as regulators step up scrutiny of deals involving AI companies.\n\nMicrosoft's $13-billion tie-up with OpenAI has raised concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about just how much influence the tech giant has over its smaller partner.\n\nIts early investment in OpenAI has made Microsoft a market leader in AI.\n\nWhen ChatGPT hit the scene in November 2022, it marked the popular arrival of the AI revolution as the chatbot dazzled users with its ability to churn out eloquent text in seconds.\n\nBut regulators began examining the partnership after a failed boardroom coup last year against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman -- whom Microsoft supported and even briefly hired.\n\nAfter the turmoil in OpenAI, Microsoft got a seat on the board as a non-voting observer that it is now giving up.\n\nMicrosoft's withdrawal is \"effective immediately\", according to a letter sent from the company to OpenAI on Tuesday.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" the letter stated.\n\n\"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nThe EU last month concluded after a preliminary examination that Microsoft's investment did not mean it had taken control of OpenAI.\n\nBrussels is however now seeking more information from Microsoft about the agreement with OpenAI to understand whether \"certain exclusivity clauses\" could harm competition.\n\nMicrosoft is also under examination over its ties to OpenAI by British competition regulators, and faced a potential antitrust probe in the United States.\n\nMore from this section Scientists baffled by green frog that turned blue HEAT ALERT: Feels-like temps up to 99 degrees today; storms expect to end the workweek Top Biden Fundraisers Hit Pause as Donors Shy Away Following Debate Performance\n\n\"It is hard not to conclude that Microsoft's decision has been heavily influenced by the ongoing competition/antitrust scrutiny,\" said Alex Haffner, a competition lawyer, at Fladgate law firm.\n\n- More scrutiny -\n\nMedia reports said Apple had similarly given up the chance to sit on OpenAI's board, but the iPhone maker was not immediately available for comment.\n\nApple had been due to get a seat after partnering with OpenAI for a suite of new AI features on its popular devices -- rolling out soon in markets outside the EU.\n\nThe bloc's competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, has put big tech on alert over investments in the fast-growing AI market and insisted that the EU continues to keep an eye over the sector.\n\nWith regulators focused on \"the complex web of inter-relationships that big tech has created with AI providers\", lawyer Haffner said there was a \"need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward\".\n\nAnother phenomenon in the AI market in the EU's crosshairs is so-called \"acqui-hires\" -- when a company acquires another firm mainly to grab its key talent -- with Brussels racing to understand if it distorts competition.\n\nMicrosoft earlier this year announced a deal to hire senior figures from OpenAI rival Inflection, including its boss, to head up a newly created consumer AI unit.\n\nBut unlike a merger, Inflection still operates as an independent company and such a move by Microsoft means it avoids a traditional merger probe.\n\nRegulators have the right to block mergers if there are fears of damage to competition.\n\nraz/ec/jxb", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news",

This move marks a shift in how major tech companies are navigating the complex landscape of AI development and regulation.\n\nIn November last year, Microsoft took a non-voting observer position on OpenAI's board after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman resumed leadership. This position allowed Microsoft to attend board meetings and access confidential information without voting rights. However, concerns from antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain, and the U.S. have prompted Microsoft to step back.\n\nMicrosoft cited substantial progress in OpenAI's governance and partnerships over the past eight months. A Microsoft letter to OpenAI dated July 9 stated, \"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this, we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nDespite Microsoft's explanation, antitrust regulators remain wary.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson announced a new strategy for stakeholder engagement. The company will host regular meetings with strategic partners like Microsoft and Apple, along with investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\n\nInterestingly, Apple, which recently announced integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices, was expected to take up the observer role but has decided against it. The Financial Times reported this decision, citing a person with direct knowledge. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers.

Apple was due to take up a similar role, but an OpenAI spokesperson said the startup will have no board observers after Microsoft's departure.\n\nRegulators in Europe and the U.S. had expressed concern about Microsoft's sway over OpenAI, applying pressure on one of the world's most valuable companies to show that it's keeping the relationship at arm's length. Microsoft has integrated OpenAI's services into its Windows and Copilot AI platforms and, like other big U.S. tech companies, is banking on the new technology to help drive growth.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" Microsoft wrote in the memo. \"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nMicrosoft is facing broader scrutiny over its alleged dominance of artificial intelligence. The U.S. has started separate investigations into Microsoft's alleged dominance of the rapidly emerging field, and whether the company properly notified antitrust agencies about its deal with an OpenAI rival, Inflection AI, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nEuropean regulators also said they were going to survey Microsoft's rivals about OpenAI's exclusive use of its technology, and the U.K.'s competition regulator is weighing a deeper investigation of the tie up.\n\nMicrosoft isn't being singled out. The U.K. is also looking into Amazon.com Inc.'s $4 billion collaboration with AI company Anthropic, expressing concern that large tech companies are using partnerships to \"shield themselves from competition.\" The U.S. is probing Nvidia Corp.'s dominance over AI chips.\n\nThe Financial Times reported Microsoft's exit earlier.\n\nThe biggest U.S. tech companies including Microsoft as well as Nvidia, Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com have poured tens of billions of dollars into AI businesses. While these investments and partnerships are a lifeline for the startups, regulators have expressed concern that they threaten to concentrate access to the most innovative large language models among the tech companies that already dominate other platforms.\n\nTech giants are also striking non-financial agreements. These include Apple's partnership with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to the iPhone, and Microsoft's decision earlier this year to bring on Inflection AI's Mustafa Suleyman and most of his staff from the OpenAI rival.\n\nMicrosoft took on the non-voting observer role on OpenAI's board last year, weeks after the startup's directors had fired Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman in a dramatic coup over the direction of the company. Altman was quickly reinstated following a backlash from employees and the board was remade.\n\n\"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,\" OpenAI said in a statement to Bloomberg News, without commenting directly on Apple or Microsoft's decisions.\n\nOpenAI said that moving forward, the company will host regular stakeholder meetings with partners and investors, including Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, \"to share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security.\"\n\nOpenAI began in 2015 as a nonprofit research organization, but later shifted its structure to include a for-profit startup that has solicited investments and struck commercial partnerships.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthropic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/resizer/v2/ZMFFQ7ZBTU6YTNMRAXFEFEG5OI.jpg?smart=true&auth=0cd66e52f6cae6225426c1f5d86e7d169a70e48d96da3e0ad1a3a45ef04b1ec3&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

"Microsoft drops OpenAI board seat as scrunity increases", "body": "Microsoft has ditched plans to take up a non-voting position on the board of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, according to a letter seen by AFP on Wednesday, as regulators step up scrutiny of deals involving AI companies.\n\nMicrosoft's $13-billion tie-up with OpenAI has raised concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about just how much influence the tech giant has over its smaller partner.\n\nIts early investment in OpenAI has made Microsoft a market leader in AI.\n\nWhen ChatGPT hit the scene in November 2022, it marked the popular arrival of the AI revolution as the chatbot dazzled users with its ability to churn out eloquent text in seconds.\n\nBut regulators began examining the partnership after a failed boardroom coup last year against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman -- whom Microsoft supported and even briefly hired.\n\nAfter the turmoil in OpenAI, Microsoft got a seat on the board as a non-voting observer that it is now giving up.\n\nMicrosoft's withdrawal is \"effective immediately\", according to a letter sent from the company to OpenAI on Tuesday.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" the letter stated.\n\n\"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nThe EU last month concluded after a preliminary examination that Microsoft's investment did not mean it had taken control of OpenAI.\n\nBrussels is however now seeking more information from Microsoft about the agreement with OpenAI to understand whether \"certain exclusivity clauses\" could harm competition.\n\nMicrosoft is also under examination over its ties to OpenAI by British competition regulators, and faced a potential antitrust probe in the United States.\n\n\"It is hard not to conclude that Microsoft's decision has been heavily influenced by the ongoing competition/antitrust scrutiny,\" said Alex Haffner, a competition lawyer, at Fladgate law firm.\n\n- More scrutiny -\n\nMedia reports said Apple had similarly given up the chance to sit on OpenAI's board, but the iPhone maker was not immediately available for comment.\n\nApple had been due to get a seat after partnering with OpenAI for a suite of new AI features on its popular devices -- rolling out soon in markets outside the EU.\n\nThe bloc's competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, has put big tech on alert over investments in the fast-growing AI market and insisted that the EU continues to keep an eye over the sector.\n\nWith regulators focused on \"the complex web of inter-relationships that big tech has created with AI providers\", lawyer Haffner said there was a \"need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward\".\n\nAnother phenomenon in the AI market in the EU's crosshairs is so-called \"acqui-hires\" -- when a company acquires another firm mainly to grab its key talent -- with Brussels racing to understand if it distorts competition.\n\nMicrosoft earlier this year announced a deal to hire senior figures from OpenAI rival Inflection, including its boss, to head up a newly created consumer AI unit.\n\nBut unlike a merger, Inflection still operates as an independent company and such a move by Microsoft means it avoids a traditional merger probe.\n\nRegulators have the right to block mergers if there are fears of damage to competition.\n\nraz/ec/jxb\n\nMore from this section\n\nDovenmuehle's Bernadette McDonnell named 2024 Mortgage Star

Yes, the two companies had just announced a partnership to bake ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence, but this was still a highly unusual level of access as one of the largest companies in the world would be getting into arguably the most important AI startup. Normally such oversight is granted alongside ownership in an entity, but not only was Apple not investing in OpenAI, there was apparently no money changing hands in their deal. As I wrote:\n\nHaving been both a board member and a board observer at a number of companies over the years, you can't overstate how big of a deal this is. While it's true that observers don't get a formal vote on various governance issues, they're still in the room for every board meeting. Listening. Weighing in. It's obviously meant to be helpful (to both the company and the entity observing) and not nefarious, but it puts Apple in a position to know a lot of what's going on within OpenAI.\n\nYes, they can and will likely have recuse themselves for certain topics where there might be competitive overlap, but if OpenAI was overly concerned about this, they wouldn't have given Apple this position.\n\nWell, while OpenAI may not have had a problem with this, clearly someone did. As today comes news that Apple will not be getting that board observer role after all. From Tabby Kinder at The Financial Times:\n\nApple had also been expected to take an observer role on OpenAI's board as part of a deal to integrate ChatGPT into the iPhone maker's devices, but would not do so, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Apple declined to comment.\n\nOpenAI would instead host regular meetings with partners such as Microsoft and Apple and investors Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures -- part of \"a new approach to informing and engaging key strategic partners\" under Sarah Friar, the former Nextdoor boss who was hired as its first chief financial officer last month, an OpenAI spokesperson said.\n\nSo no one is refuting the reporting, first by Bloomberg and backed up by the FT, that Apple was in line to get this board role - going so far to note that longtime Apple executive Phil Schiller would be taking the position. Now that offer is being rescinded or declined. And while the attempt here is clearly to frame this all as \"nothing to see here\". Clearly there's something to see here! Because yes, Microsoft is also giving up their observer role on OpenAI's board.\n\nThe Occam's razor guess would be that Microsoft wasn't thrilled with the notion of Apple getting equal footing in that board room. After all, it cost Microsoft roughly $15B to get that right, while it cost Apple $0. But beyond that, again, this is just a lot of access to grant a rival into Microsoft's largest and most important investment. I know that is an obvious guess because it's what I guessed last week:\n\nAnd my god, what must Microsoft think of this? I joked that it only cost them $15B or so to get what Apple just got for free. There had already been various reports of tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft around the Apple deal (and perhaps on the flip side, Microsoft's Inflection no-deal deal), but Microsoft must in part see this as letting the fox into the henhouse. The very expensive henhouse built with Microsoft's money!\n\nWell, now that gold-plated henhouse is secure again. All it took was mother hen leaving as well. A tall ask, perhaps, but Microsoft is obviously framing this as their decision to step down - per a memo obtained by Ina Fried:\n\n\"We appreciate the support shown by OpenAI leadership and the OpenAI board as we made this decision,\" Microsoft said.\n\n\"As you know, we accepted the non-voting board observer role at a time when OpenAI was in the process of rebuilding its board,\" Microsoft said in the letter. \"This position provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence, and we appreciated the opportunity to serve as an observer during this period of change.\"\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\"\n\n\"Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" Microsoft added.\n\nI think it's quite likely that it was their decision - again, perhaps in exchange for ensure Apple didn't join those board meetings. But also, Microsoft having such a role always seemed problematic, simply from an optics perspective. Again, as I wrote:\n\nAnd Microsoft didn't even have observer rights until after the company nearly imploded and Satya Nadella stepped in to save and restore Sam Altman's job. To be fair, they probably didn't want to be in the board room beforehand simply because of the optics of that role alongside the massive investment (which alone has drawn the gaze of regulators). But once everything went to hell, they clearly felt the need to have more oversight - and understandably so!\n\nThe regulatory pressure is only increasing - especially as the \"hackqusition\" maneuver that Microsoft pioneered with Inflection (itself stemming from the near-hiring of Sam Altman and the rest of OpenAI back in November of 2023) spreads to other Big Tech companies. And Microsoft's investment in OpenAI itself remains under scrutiny. Sure, not having a formal board seat helps a bit, but again, they were still in that room. They were getting access to and input to all sorts of privileged information. That notion is why Microsoft called it a \"limited role\" but that's silly semantics. As someone who has been in such rooms many times, I can tell you, if you're in the room, you're in the room. The things you actually vote on as a director are usually stock grant approvals and the minutes from the last board meeting. It's true that Microsoft didn't have say over those elements, phew!\n\nBefore this site even existed, I found it odd that Microsoft would want any sort of formal role within OpenAI given the regulatory risk above. Again, clearly they felt the need to put \"an adult in the room\" after the near-implosion of the company, but that was after the new board was already being put in place. And yes, that board is now more built out than it was, impressively so, but there's no chance or reason for Microsoft to leave after just eight months (maybe two board meetings?) unless it was being used as a bargaining chip or to avoid regulatory scrutiny. And, I think in this case, both things are true.\n\nThis also alleviates some inevitable future tension in that board room if and when Apple - and Microsoft - continued to go down their own AI paths, working on projects that conflict with OpenAI. Back to my thoughts last week:\n\nYou can't help but get vibes of then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt on Apple's board. That ended in tension with the rise of Android. Apple is obviously already working on their own AI capabilities. And everyone assumes that they'll own more and more of that stack overtime, potentially pushing onto OpenAI's turf. The same is true of Microsoft, of course. But Microsoft owns 49% of OpenAI. Apple owns 0%.\n\nThe very real tension of Microsoft owning that 49% - sorry, having the right to 49% of the profits, you hear that, regulators? - remains and will undoubtedly also continue to increase. But that's going to be much, much more complicated to unwind. Perhaps OpenAI thought Apple could eventually be a new capital partner. Or perhaps Apple simply asked for more oversight alongside their partnership given the drama which constantly swirls around OpenAI. But again, that board element was also weird from that perspective because Apple has already stated that they were going to be bringing on other AI partners to be a part of Apple Intelligence eventually. OpenAI was simply the first.\n\nAnyway, henhouse secured. For now. The foxes are back outside. I'm sure this will appease regulators. Right?

information from Microsoft about the agreement with OpenAI, Vestager said on June 28, to understand whether \"certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative effect on

It comes a week after Bloomberg spilled the beans on Apple's Phil Schiller prepping to join the OpenAI board, as part of an AI partnership between two companies.\n\nThe observer position that Microsoft assumed in November, following OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reclaiming his position, allowed the tech major led by Satya Nadella to attend OpenAI's board meetings without voting rights and access confidential information.\n\nMicrosoft's decision to ditch the observer seat is effective immediately. \"We appreciate the support shown by OpenAI leadership and the OpenAI board as we made this decision,\" Microsoft said, according to Axios.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple, expected to assume a similar role, may not take on the observer position, FT reported, citing a \"person with direct knowledge of the matter\". Instead, OpenAI will hold regular meetings with partners such as Microsoft and Apple, as well as investors Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures. This forms part of a new strategy led by Sarah Friar, OpenAI's new CFO and former CEO of Nextdoor, to keep these key partners informed and engaged.\n\nIt's believed that antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain, and the U.S. are concerned about Microsoft's significant investment of over $10 billion in OpenAI and its observer seat, fearing it may wield too much influence over OpenAI. Nevertheless, Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI has resulted in the latter's exponential growth in recent years.\n\nSo far, Generative AI has become synonymous with OpenAI's ChatGPT, which continues to make waves on the internet.

Former marketing chief and current fellow Phil Schiller was rumored to be the frontrunner, but plans to have any Apple exec join the board have now been scuttled, the FT says.\n\nIn a statement, an OpenAI spokesperson said, \"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.\"\n\nMicrosoft gets a share of the profits from an OpenAI subsidiary, the FT says.", "source": {"uri": "pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jibin_joseph@pcmag.com", "name": "Jibin Joseph", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition and Markets Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Databases", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/03Eu7PEqSQBMKKkTtJ3EpYs-1.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1720609351.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The tech giant says it's now confident in OpenAI's direction and no longer needs the oversight role.\n\nFor context, last November, the AI community was shaken by the sudden firing of Sam Altman by OpenAI's board. The resulting chaos saw Microsoft play a pivotal behind-the-scenes role in facilitating Altman's return and restructuring the board. The turmoil led to a near-complete overhaul of OpenAI's board, retaining only one previous member, Adam D'Angelo, and adding new faces like Bret Taylor, Larry Summers, and recently, Paul Nakasone.\n\nIn a letter to OpenAI, Microsoft pointed to \"significant progress\" over the past eight months as the reason for its departure. \"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" the company stated. The letter also acknowledged the role of the observer seat in providing insights into the board's activities during a period of change.\n\nIn a statement, OpenAI responded to Microsoft's decision with gratitude and optimism. \"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company.\"\n\nIn the wake of Microsoft's exit, OpenAI has also announced a shift in its approach to stakeholder engagement. Rather than observer board seats, the startup says it plans to now hold \"regular stakeholder meetings to share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security.\" This change also affects Apple, which had been rumored to be in line for a similar position following a recent partnership to integrate ChatGPT with Siri.\n\nThe departure of Microsoft and the decision not to have any more observers on OpenAI's board come amid increasing scrutiny from antitrust regulators in the EU and the US. Both the European Commission and the Federal Trade Commission have been closely examining the partnerships between big tech companies and emerging AI players to prevent any undue influence that could stifle competition.\n\nMicrosoft's substantial investment in OpenAI, reportedly around $13 billion, has been instrumental in propelling the company to the forefront of the generative AI race.

Microsoft had accepted the non-voting board position in the wake of Altman's surprise removal and reinstatement as CEO of OpenAI last year.\n\nThe news comes after European and American antitrust authorities announced investigations into the partnership between the two tech companies. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department both approved potential antitrust examinations due to the growth of artificial intelligence as a significant industry.\n\nMicrosoft's partnership with OpenAI, which was co-founded by Altman, Elon Musk and several other tech visionaries, was a significant part in the fledgling company's ability to grow and develop ChatGPT. Among other things, the investment enabled OpenAI quick access to high-level computing power and cloud storage.\n\nThe FT reported that in the letter, Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Keith Dolliver said: \"This position provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence. We have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\"\n\nDolliver maintained that OpenAI remained one of Microsoft's \"most valued partners\" in the artificial intelligence space.\n\nIn response to the letter, a spokesperson for OpenAI told the FT: \"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.\"\n\nMicrosoft gained the observational position on the board after Altman was removed as CEO in a coup in November last year, only to be reinstated less than a week later.

The Times says that will no longer be the case. Instead, OpenAI will take on a new approach and hold regular meetings with key partners, including the two Big Tech companies. In the letter, Microsoft reportedly told OpenAI that it's confident in the direction the company is taking, so its seat on the board is no longer necessary.\n\nThe company also wrote that its seat \"provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence,\" but the European Commission wants to take a closer look at their relationship before deciding if it agrees. \"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told The Times.\n\nMicrosoft initially invested $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019. Since then, the company has poured more money into the AI company until it has reached $13 billion in investments. The European Commission started investigating their partnership to figure out if it breaks the bloc's merger rules last year, but it ultimately concluded that Microsoft didn't gain control of OpenAI. It didn't drop the probe altogether, however -- Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president for competition policy, revealed in June that European authorities asked Microsoft for additional information regarding their agreement \"to understand whether certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative effect on competitors.\"\n\nThe commission is looking into the Microsoft-OpenAI agreement as part of a bigger antitrust investigation.

It said the resignation of the observer role, which does not carry a vote in board decisions, was \"effective immediately\".\n\nMicrosoft said it had seen significant progress by OpenAI's new board, which was formed in the wake of the dramatic sacking and reinstatement of the chief executive, Sam Altman, last year. It said OpenAI was going in the right direction, including a commitment to safety and building a \"great culture\".\n\n\"Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" said Microsoft, which has invested $13bn (\u00a310.2bn) into OpenAI.\n\nHowever, it is understood that Microsoft believed the observer role was causing concern among competition regulators. In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority is reviewing whether the partnership has resulted in \"an acquisition of control\", while in the US the Federal Trade Commission is also looking at the partnership.\n\nThe European Commission has decided not to conduct a formal merger review into Microsoft's investment in OpenAI but is scrutinising exclusivity clauses in the agreement between the companies.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said that the San Francisco-based startup was establishing a new approach to \"informing and engaging key strategic partners\" such as Microsoft and Apple as well as other financial investors.\n\n\"Moving forward, we will host regular stakeholder meetings to share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security. We look forward to continuing to receive feedback and advice from these key stakeholders,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOpenAI will no longer have board observers under the new approach, which rules out Apple taking up such a role. It was reported this month that Apple was set to place the head of its app store, Phil Schiller, on the board as part of an agreement announced in June. Apple has been approached for comment.\n\nInvestments in AI startups are coming under scrutiny from regulators. As well as looking at Open AI and Microsoft, the FTC has said it is examining tie-ups between Anthropic, the company behind the Claude chatbot, and two tech powerhouses: Google and Amazon. In the UK, the CMA is also looking at Amazon and Anthropic as well as Microsoft's partnerships with Mistral and Inflection AI.\n\nAlex Haffner, a partner at the UK law firm Fladgate, said it was \"hard not to conclude\" that Microsoft's decision had been influenced by the regulatory environment.\n\n\"It is clear that regulators are very much focused on the complex web of inter-relationships that big tech has created with AI providers, hence the need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_milmo@theguardian.com", "name": "Dan Milmo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_and_Markets_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition and Markets Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "App store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Schiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d58d9d455dc6fe0f593ef43b9a37198afdbf36f/63_57_3399_2041/master/3399.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=5fd703cfb3ccf479169852f15bbce08f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The UK's competition regulator is also investigating Amazon's $4 billion collaboration with AI company Anthropic, and the US is probing Nvidia's dominance in AI chips.\n\nDespite the withdrawal, Microsoft and OpenAI will continue their partnership, but due to the role of the board seat, they will not have regulatory oversight.\n\nOpenAI also plans to maintain regular stakeholder meetings with its partners and investors to ensure ongoing collaboration on safety, security, and progress towards their shared goals.", "source": {"uri": "vcpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Venture Capital Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thea_felicity@vcpost.com", "name": "Thea Felicity", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phil Schiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product bundling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://data.vcpost.com/data/thumbs/full/106657/620/0/0/0/apple-microsoft-back-out-from-openai-board-seats-over-antitrust-concerns.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The spokesperson reportedly said that the company continues to provide access to eligible customers in the country, via models deployed in regions outside China. The spokesperson added that OpenAI is an independent company and makes its own decisions.\n\nLately, several reports suggested that any foreign company that wants to offer AI models in China will have to get them approved by the authorities and partner with a Chinese company. For example, Apple is reportedly looking to partner with a Chinese AI company to launch its Apple Intelligence features in China.\n\nThis is because ChatGPT is banned in the country, and the company must find a local Al chatbot that will work alongside Siri to handle requests for Al-generated content, a report by The Wall Street Journal said.

The former accepted an observer role in November 2023 as Sam Altman was ousted (and returned) from OpenAI.\n\nNotably, this comes almost a full year after the FTC launched its investigation into the generative AI company. At the time, it believed ChatGPT potentially violated consumer protection laws and harmed consumers.\n\nThe exit of both companies means OpenAI no longer has any observers on the board. On Microsoft and Apple's side, this absolves them of any potential (and further) antitrust attention from regulators.\n\nIn a letter obtained by Axios, Microsoft said this move was effective immediately.

This comes just days after reports suggested Apple might take a similar observer role, but now the Cupertino giant has also opted out.\n\nMicrosoft's exit, communicated via a letter on Tuesday, cited \"significant progress\" made by OpenAI's newly formed board, according to Axios. This explanation rings somewhat hollow, considering Microsoft's role was established just last November following a period of upheaval at OpenAI that saw the ousting and reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman.\n\nOpenAI announced a new safety and security committee in May end as it began training a new AI model intended to replace the GPT-4 chatbot. A month later, OpenAI pushed out the rollout of its highly anticipated \"Voice Mode\" feature for ChatGPT to July, citing safety concerns. The company said it needed more time to ensure the model could \"detect and refuse certain content.\"\n\nThe timing of these decisions coincides neatly with growing regulatory pressure on Big Tech's influence in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the European Commission (EC) have expressed concerns that tech giants' investments in AI startups like OpenAI could stifle competition and create monopolies in key technological areas.\n\nIn June, the FTC launched an investigation into Big Tech investments in generative AI startups, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. The EC, meanwhile, explored the possibility of an antitrust probe into the Microsoft-OpenAI partnership after deciding against a merger control investigation.\n\nWhile both Microsoft and OpenAI maintain the company's independence despite the multi-billion dollar investment, the optics surrounding the close relationship are not lost on regulators.

The move comes amidst reports of increased regulatory scrutiny over the involvement of tech giants in AI startups.\n\nMicrosoft, which had invested significantly in OpenAI, including a substantial USD 13 billion investment in its generative AI technology, ChatGPT, has announced its immediate withdrawal from its observer role on OpenAI's board.\n\nThe decision was communicated via a letter to OpenAI, citing the company's satisfaction with the progress made by the newly formed board.\n\nSimilarly, Apple, which was expected to take up a similar observer role as part of an agreement to integrate ChatGPT into its devices, has opted not to do so.\n\nAlthough Apple declined to comment on the matter, sources familiar with the situation indicate that the tech giant will not be taking an observer position on OpenAI's board.\n\nIn response to these developments, OpenAI has announced a revised strategy for engaging with its strategic partners and investors.\n\nAccording to the FT report, the organization plans to hold regular meetings with partners like Microsoft and Apple, along with investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\n\nThis shift, as explained by an OpenAI spokesperson, aims to foster a more inclusive and collaborative approach to governance and strategic decision-making.\n\nThe board of OpenAI recently saw the addition of Phil Schiller, Apple's former marketing chief, as an observer, which was reported just days before these withdrawals.\n\nHowever, Schiller will no longer be observing OpenAI's operations, highlighting the fluidity and perhaps underlying tensions within the organization's boardroom dynamics.\n\nAnalysts speculate that the decision by Microsoft and Apple to step back from their observer roles could be linked to strategic considerations or internal dynamics within OpenAI.\n\nWhile some suggest possible concerns over antitrust scrutiny or strategic disagreements, the exact motivations behind these decisions remain unclear.

According to a report in Reuters, Microsoft Corp has relinquished the chance to be observers on OpenAI's board. The report quotes a person familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified discussing a private move.\n\nMicrosoft is said to have sent a letter regarding the same to the ChatGPT maker OpenAI.The letter announces the company's decision to withdraw from the AI startup's board. Microsoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI.\n\nWhy Microsoft gave the seat on OpenAI board\n\nThe surprise decision is said to be due to the growing scrutiny from antitrust regulators on Big Tech's influence over artificial intelligence.\n\nThe move comes after European regulators in June said that they were going to survey Microsoft's rivals about OpenAI's exclusive use of its technology. It shows the increasing pressure on Microsoft, which hopes to tap OpenAI's services to propel its Windows and Copilot AI platforms. Bloomberg News recently reported that the US is opening a separate antitrust investigation into Microsoft's alleged dominance of the rapidly emerging field.\n\nMicrosoft, which also runs the Azure cloud computing service, reportedly faces questions about its other investments in the sphere.\n\nThe FTC also opened a probe into whether Microsoft failed to properly notify the antitrust agencies about its deal with Inflection AI, according to the people. In March, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant agreed to pay the startup $650 million to license its AI software and hired much of Inflection's staff.\n\nOpenAI on Microsoft leaving the board\n\nResponding to Microsoft giving up the board seat, an OpenAI spokesperson told Bloomberg in a statement, \"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.\"\n\nMicrosoft took the observer position after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was fired last year by the board and later eventually rehired.Post Altman's rehiring, most of the board members were reshuffled.

Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry) or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\nMicrosoft and Apple have decided against taking up board seats at OpenAI. The decision comes as regulatory bodies intensify their scrutiny of big tech's involvement in AI development and deployment.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report on July 10, citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter, Microsoft has officially communicated its withdrawal from the OpenAI board. This move comes approximately a year after the Redmond-based company made a substantial $13 billion investment in OpenAI in April 2023.\n\nIn a memo addressed to OpenAI, Microsoft stated: \"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\" The tech giant added, \"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nContrary to recent reports suggesting that Apple would secure an observer role on OpenAI's board as part of a landmark agreement announced in June, it appears that OpenAI will now have no board observers following Microsoft's departure.\n\nResponding to these developments, OpenAI expressed gratitude towards Microsoft, stating, \"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.\"\n\nThis retreat from board involvement by major tech players occurs against a backdrop of mounting regulatory pressure. Concerns about the potential impact of big tech on AI development and industry dominance have prompted increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies worldwide.\n\nIn June, European Union regulators announced that OpenAI could face an EU antitrust investigation over its partnership with Microsoft. EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager also revealed plans for local regulators to seek additional third-party views and survey firms such as Microsoft, Google, Meta, and ByteDance's TikTok regarding their AI partnerships.\n\nThe decision by Microsoft and Apple to step back from board positions at OpenAI could be interpreted as a strategic move to mitigate potential regulatory challenges. By maintaining a more arm's length relationship with the AI firm, these tech giants may be attempting to avoid accusations of undue influence or control over AI development.\n\nAlex Haffner, a competition partner at Fladgate, said:\n\n\"It is hard not to conclude that Microsoft's decision has been heavily influenced by the ongoing competition/antitrust scrutiny of its (and other major tech players) influence over emerging AI players such as Open AI.\n\nMicrosoft scored a 'win' in this regard at the end of June when the EU Commission announced it was dropping its merger control probe of Microsoft and Open AI, an investigation originally announced when Open AI re-shaped its board structure at the time of Sam Altman's on-off departure from the company.\n\nHowever, the Commission confirmed it was still looking at the competitive impact of the broader arrangements between the parties and it is clear that regulators are very much focussed on the complex web of interrelationships that big tech has created with AI providers, hence the need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward.\"\n\nAs AI continues to play an increasingly critical role in technological advancement and societal change, the balance between innovation, competition, and regulation remains a complex challenge for both industry players and policymakers.\n\nThe coming months will likely see continued scrutiny of AI partnerships and investments, as regulators worldwide grapple with the task of ensuring fair competition and responsible AI development.\n\n(Photo by Andrew Neel)\n\nSee also: Nvidia: World's most valuable company under French antitrust fire\n\nWant to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

These partners like Microsoft and Apple along with big-shot investors like Khosla Ventures and Thrive Capital will now get regular meetings with Sarah Friar, the former Nextdoor boss and now OpenAI's CFO.\n\nThe media is focused on the antitrust angle. They say this shake-up could mean smoother sailing for both companies. Microsoft dodges potential antitrust headaches, while OpenAI gets to run its ship without Big Tech looking over its shoulder.\n\nBut let's brew some rumours here. OpenAI's integration with Apple was less than stellar. OpenAI wasn't getting paid for the integration either. Giving them a board seat would've been too much. What if Sam and Uncle Bret (Board chair) scrapped the observer seat system to get rid of this drama? I won't be surprised.", "source": {"uri": "bensbites.beehiiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ben's Bites"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_s_bites@bensbites.beehiiv.com", "name": "Ben's Bites", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_M._Nakasone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul M.

The move comes amidst reports of increased regulatory scrutiny over the involvement of tech giants in AI startups.\n\nMicrosoft, which had invested significantly in OpenAI, including a substantial USD 13 billion investment in its generative AI technology, ChatGPT, has announced its immediate withdrawal from its observer role on OpenAI's board.\n\nAlso Read | Violet Affleck Urges 'Mask Mandates' in Emotional Address; Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's Daughter Reveals Impact of Post-Viral Condition (Watch Video) .\n\nThe decision was communicated via a letter to OpenAI, citing the company's satisfaction with the progress made by the newly formed board.\n\nSimilarly, Apple, which was expected to take up a similar observer role as part of an agreement to integrate ChatGPT into its devices, has opted not to do so.\n\nAlso Read | India vs Zimbabwe Live Streaming Online, 3rd T20I 2024: How To Watch IND vs ZIM Cricket Match Free Live Telecast on TV?.\n\nAlthough Apple declined to comment on the matter, sources familiar with the situation indicate that the tech giant will not be taking an observer position on OpenAI's board.\n\nIn response to these developments, OpenAI has announced a revised strategy for engaging with its strategic partners and investors.\n\nAccording to the FT report, the organization plans to hold regular meetings with partners like Microsoft and Apple, along with investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\n\nThis shift, as explained by an OpenAI spokesperson, aims to foster a more inclusive and collaborative approach to governance and strategic decision-making.\n\nThe board of OpenAI recently saw the addition of Phil Schiller, Apple's former marketing chief, as an observer, which was reported just days before these withdrawals.\n\nHowever, Schiller will no longer be observing OpenAI's operations, highlighting the fluidity and perhaps underlying tensions within the organization's boardroom dynamics.\n\nAnalysts speculate that the decision by Microsoft and Apple to step back from their observer roles could be linked to strategic considerations or internal dynamics within OpenAI.\n\nWhile some suggest possible concerns over antitrust scrutiny or strategic disagreements, the exact motivations behind these decisions remain unclear.

Due to US-China trade tensions, Beijing's effort to improve its technology self-sufficiency has increased.\n\nThe central government is phasing out Windows and Intel CPUs in critical government projects that use Kylin, the closed-source forerunner of openKylin. Kylinsoft, a subsidiary of state-owned China Electronics, and over ten other Chinese businesses, including the National Industrial Information Security Development Research Centre, founded the openKylin open-source community.\n\nOver 3,876 developers and 271 corporations contributed to openKylin 1.0, its first open-source desktop OS, launched in July 2022. Despite these attempts, StatCounter reported that Windows controlled approximately 80% of the China market as of June 2023.\n\nOther Chinese tech firms showcased their innovations during the recent World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai. Alibaba Group Holding Limited and SenseTime showed considerable AI developments, per Benzinga, signaling heated rivalry in China's AI business.\n\nSenseTime upgraded its SenseNova large language models (LLMs), including 5.5, which improves performance by 30%. SenseTime co-founder and CEO Xu Li said OpenCompass data showed SenseNova 5.5 exceeded GPT-4 in five categories.\n\nRead Also: Miss AI: World's First AI Beauty Pageant Crowned Amid Rising AI Integration in Entertainment\n\nIn two months, Alibaba's cloud computing subsidiary doubled Tongyi Qianwen LLM downloads to over 20 million. Zhou Jingren, Alibaba Cloud's CTO, reported a 150% growth in Model Studio users to 230,000. Despite these gains, Alibaba's shares fell on Monday.\n\nMoreover, Baidu unveiled Ernie 4.0 Turbo, its newest LLM, strengthening its pricing battle with Microsoft Corp.'s OpenAI GPT-4 model, Alibaba, and others.\n\nThese developments come as OpenAI started prohibiting Chinese users from using its tools and services this week, making it simpler for China to recruit domestic developers for local AI platforms. Last month, OpenAI said it would limit API traffic from locations where it doesn't support access.\n\nOpenAI has not explained this abrupt shift. The Chinese government's firewall blocks ChatGPT, but developers used VPNs to access OpenAI's tools for fine-tuning their generative AI applications.\n\nDue to rising tensions between Washington and Beijing, the US has restricted exports of sophisticated semiconductors to China, which are necessary for training AI technology. The AI sector is under pressure, which likely drove OpenAI's decision.\n\nXiaohu Zhu, founder of Shanghai's Center for Safe AGI, worries about worldwide AI technology access. According to The Guardian, this move also allows local AI businesses like SenseTime, Baidu, Zhipu AI, and Tencent Cloud to lure former OpenAI users.\n\nBaidu responded by offering 50 million free tokens for their Ernie 3.5 AI model and free migration. Through July, Zhipu AI is giving out 150 million free tokens for their model, while Tencent Cloud is giving away 100 million. These companies aggressively promote migration to expand their user base.", "source": {"uri": "techtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

With Microsoft's existing ties to OpenAI, future board meetings may address potential agreements between OpenAI and Microsoft, leading to some complexity due to Schiller's presence.\n\nAlthough Schiller has not yet participated in any OpenAI board meetings, he is expected to do so later this year.\n\nIt's worth noting that at present, the collaboration between Apple and OpenAI does not involve any financial transactions. However, it's anticipated that Apple will receive a share of ChatGPT subscriptions generated through its platforms in the future. The agreement is set to be implemented later this year, with ChatGPT becoming integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia as a result of this partnership.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phil Schiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS/iPadOS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "App Store (iOS/iPadOS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequoia Capital"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2024/july/apple-03072024-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

OpenAI's board currently comprises Independent Directors Bret Taylor (Chair), Sam Altman, Adam D'Angelo, Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, Retired U.S. Army General Paul M. Nakasone, Nicole Seligman, Fidji Simo, and Larry Summers. Today, Microsoft has notified OpenAI that it is giving up its observer seat on OpenAI's board. Microsoft's deputy general counsel, Keith Dolliver, wrote a letter to OpenAI's board regarding this on Tuesday, and its decision to leave OpenAI's board is effective immediately.\n\nHere's why Microsoft is giving up its observer seat on OpenAI's board:\n\nMicrosoft accepted the non-voting board observer role at a time when OpenAI was in the process of rebuilding its board. This observer position provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence. Over the past eight months, Microsoft saw significant progress from the newly formed board and is confident in OpenAI's direction. So, Microsoft believes that its limited role as an observer is no longer necessary.\n\nDespite not being part of OpenAI's board, OpenAI remains one of Microsoft's most valued partners. OpenAI's spokesperson provided the following statement regarding Microsoft's decision to leave OpenAI's board:\n\n\"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.\"\n\nLast week, Bloomberg reported that Apple would get a non-voting observer board seat at OpenAI, matching Microsoft's influence. However, The Financial Times today reported that Apple is not joining OpenAI's board. On a related note, Apple last month announced that it would integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT in iOS, macOS, and iPadOS.\n\nMicrosoft's departure from OpenAI's board signals a significant milestone in their relationship, highlighting a shift from oversight to partnership. While Microsoft's formal presence on the board may be ending, its collaboration with OpenAI is expected to continue to flourish.\n\nSource: The Financial Times", "source": {"uri": "neowin.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Neowin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pradeep_viswanathan@neowin.net", "name": "Pradeep Viswanathan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidji_Simo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fidji Simo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_M._Nakasone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul M.

This setup allows Chinese companies to harness OpenAI's conversational AI models through the Azure OpenAI Service, despite OpenAI not officially supporting its offerings in the region. 21Vianet, also known as VNET Group, Inc., is the biggest private internet data center service provider in China focusing on carrier neutrality.\n\nOpenAI maintains a policy of blocking unauthorized access from unsupported regions, including China. Starting from July 9, these restrictions are set to be more stringent. Nonetheless, Microsoft declares that there is no alteration in its Azure OpenAI Service in China, enabling Chinese firms to use models deployed internationally.\n\nThe availability of OpenAI models via Azure in China can potentially impact local AI innovations. While OpenAI limits direct access, Microsoft's collaboration offers a conduit for Chinese firms to tap into OpenAI's advancements, potentially boosting AI progress in the country.\n\nThe Biden administration is pushing for more stringent oversight of major cloud providers like Microsoft to scrutinize foreign entities, particularly those developing AI technologies. This aligns with broader strategies to restrict China's access to advanced tech due to concerns over Beijing's rapid AI advancements.\n\nChina leads globally in the filing of generative AI patents, surpassing the U.S., as reported by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). This highlights the crucial role AI plays in China's tech strategy and the international competitive landscape.\n\nOpenAI offers its services globally but enforces rules to block or suspend accounts from unsupported regions such as China. Despite these measures, Chinese companies continue to access OpenAI's API, indicating a strong demand for sophisticated AI tools in the area.\n\nMicrosoft is a long-time partner of OpenAI and has invested billions into the company. OpenAI uses Azure as its primary cloud platform. Microsoft helps the company develop its AI models and has integrated services like GPT and ChatGPT across its products.

Apple had been expected to take up a similar role, but an OpenAI spokesperson said the startup will have no board observers after Microsoft's departure.\n\nLast month, European regulators said they were going to survey Microsoft's rivals about OpenAI's exclusive use of its technology. That underscores the mounting pressure on one of the world's most valuable companies, which hopes to tap OpenAI's services to propel its Windows and Copilot AI platforms. The US is opening a separate antitrust investigation into Microsoft's alleged dominance of the rapidly emerging field, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction,\" Microsoft wrote in its memo to OpenAI, reviewed by Bloomberg News. \"We no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\"\n\nMicrosoft, which also runs the Azure cloud computing service, faces questions about its other investments in the sphere.\n\nThe FTC also opened a probe into whether Microsoft failed to properly notify the antitrust agencies about its deal with Inflection AI, according to the people. In March, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant agreed to pay the startup $650 million to license its AI software and hired much of Inflection's staff.\n\n\"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,\" OpenAI said in a statement to Bloomberg News, without commenting directly on Apple or Microsoft's decisions.

But that awkward situation has suddenly been averted.\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI's biggest partner and investor, has been a board observer since last year's leadership crisis, in which Microsoft and everyone else were shocked by OpenAI's board abruptly and briefly firing CEO Sam Altman. And, as I wrote last week, Apple, which plans to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, was reportedly about to get the same privilege.\n\nHowever, it emerged today that Microsoft has dropped its observer role with immediate effect, and Apple won't take one either. Microsoft reportedly told OpenAI in a letter that its seven months observing meetings \"provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence,\" and the role was no longer necessary because \"we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\"\n\nInstead of having board observers, OpenAI said it will now just hold regular meetings with its strategic partners and investors. This seems a far more sensible approach, for multiple reasons.\n\nFirstly, while European antitrust officials earlier this year dropped a probe into Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI -- they conceded Microsoft had not taken control of its partner -- there's now a broader EU review taking place, covering strategic investments and partnerships across the entire AI industry. Regulators in the U.K. and U.S. are also paying close attention. This is not a time for Microsoft and OpenAI to appear overly cozy.\n\nSecondly...well, here I'm going to hand things over to Data Sheet reader JE, who wrote me this in response to last week's essay about the subject:\n\n\"The issue of letting major customers sit in on board meetings would seem to raise all kinds of issues. As the retired chair of the board of a publicly traded company, I would have real concerns about how we could have functioned with customers or even large shareholders sitting in on what should be candid, serious and confidential discussions...I question how this 'observation' can be helpful if open-ended. Having input and discussion for a defined topic and time in meetings with customers is fine; attending meetings as an observer or participant is not.\"\n\nDoubly so if two competing customers like Microsoft and Apple are both in the room, I imagine.\n\nSince we're on the subject of AI, Elon Musk's xAI startup has decided to build its own data center systems rather than continuing its server rental agreement with Oracle. The Information had the scoop and the man himself confirmed it on X, where he said xAI's only chance of catching up with more established rivals was to move faster than them.\n\n\"Oracle is a great company...but, when our fate depends on being the fastest by far, we must have our own hands on the steering wheel, rather than be a backseat driver,\" Musk tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has for the first time accused another country of using generative AI in a foreign influence campaign, Reuters reports. You will be shocked to hear that Russia is the alleged miscreant -- a Russian organization apparently designed an AI-powered bot farm to spread disinformation in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nFinally, Fortune AI maestro Jeremy Kahn has a new book out! It's called Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future and I for one can't wait to read it. We published an excerpt yesterday -- which appropriately focuses on AI's potential for surreptitiously influencing people -- and you can also read Jeremy's own rundown of the book's key themes in yesterday's Eye On AI essay.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Spokespeople for OpenAI and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe rise of OpenAI and other AI start-ups like Anthropic, spurred by interest in ChatGPT and other chatbots, shook up the tech industry last year. Analysts and tech leaders have suggested that the newcomers could usurp some of the power of dominant players like Microsoft.\n\nBut OpenAI and other leading AI start-ups have become dependent on investment from the largest tech companies, due to the immense costs of developing cutting edge AI. Algorithms behind systems like ChatGPT are trained using expensive and power-hungry computer hardware.\n\nMicrosoft invested billions in OpenAI in early 2023, while Anthropic took on funding from Google and Amazon last year as well. But those deals have drawn attention from regulators. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nIn January, the Federal Trade Commission said it would look into whether the investments and partnerships between AI companies and Big Tech are stifling true competition.\n\n\"Our study will shed light on whether investments and partnerships pursued by dominant companies risk distorting innovation and undermining fair competition,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement at the time.\n\nOpenAI has been hiring lawyers and lobbyists at a rapid pace as it has grown and faced more legal and regulatory pressure. The company is facing a growing number of lawsuits from news organizations, authors and other content creators who say the company used their copyrighted work to train its AI algorithms without payment or permission.\n\nDespite its prominence, OpenAI's business is still nascent and it needs to find many more customers if it is to turn a profit. Forming alliances with Big Tech can help AI start-ups gain access to billions of paying customers around the world, an easier path than developing new products from scratch.\n\nOpenAI and Apple framed their recent deal as mutually beneficial, with Apple enhancing the iPhone by providing access to ChatGPT and OpenAI getting its technology introduced to users of Apple phones and computers.\n\nMicrosoft's advisory role on OpenAI's board was announced after the AI company's dramatic boardroom showdown in November.

Apple declined to comment.\n\nOpenAI would instead host regular meetings with partners such as Microsoft and Apple and investors Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures -- part of \"a new approach to informing and engaging key strategic partners\" under Sarah Friar, the former Nextdoor boss who was hired as its first chief financial officer last month, an OpenAI spokesperson said.\n\nThe move also comes as antitrust authorities in the EU and US examine the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI as part of broader concerns about competition in the rapidly growing sector.\n\nMicrosoft accepted a non-voting role on the board following the chaos that engulfed OpenAI last year when its chief executive Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the board, before being reinstated just days later. The attempted boardroom coup threatened OpenAI's valuation, and with it Microsoft's multibillion-dollar investment into the company.\n\n\"This position provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence,\" Microsoft's deputy general counsel Keith Dolliver wrote in a letter to OpenAI late on Tuesday. Since then \"we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\" Therefore, Microsoft's role on the board was no longer \"necessary\", he said.\n\nOpenAI remains one of Microsoft's \"most valued partners\", Dolliver wrote.\n\nThe Microsoft partnership has been critical to OpenAI's success. The start-up has relied on Microsoft for computing power and cloud storage worth billions of dollars. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella was a key power broker during the boardroom upheaval at OpenAI in November.\n\nInvesting in OpenAI has also propelled Microsoft to an early lead in the generative AI race. The company said in April that it was struggling to keep up with demand for its AI services, which have helped drive sales at its Azure cloud computing platform at an accelerated rate over the past three quarters.\n\nMicrosoft does not have a conventional equity stake in the start-up. Instead, it has an entitlement to a share of the profits from a subsidiary of OpenAI, up to a certain limit.\n\nAccording to OpenAI's website it \"remains an entirely independent company governed by the OpenAI Nonprofit\".\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI have played down their ties as antitrust concerns have grown. The European Commission said in June it was exploring the possibility of an antitrust investigation into the tie-up after it said it would not proceed with a probe under merger control rules. The Federal Trade Commission in the US has also begun scrutinising investments made by Big Tech companies including Microsoft, Amazon and Google into generative AI start-ups.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said: \"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.\"\n\nOpenAI's eight-person board includes Altman as well as Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, and Fidji Simo, chief executive of grocery delivery company Instacart. It is chaired by Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of Salesforce and co-founder of AI start-up Sierra.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [],

This decision follows heightened regulatory scrutiny on Big Tech investments in AI startups. The arrangement, part of a broader collaboration to integrate ChatGPT into Apple's ecosystem, will proceed without board participation from either Apple or Microsoft, both of whom have relinquished their observer positions.\n\nOriginally, Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow and App Store chief, was set to take on the role as a board observer. This position would have allowed Apple to attend and contribute to OpenAI's board meetings without having voting rights or formal control. However, both companies have now shifted to a new strategy of regular meetings with partners to maintain engagement and share strategic insights. These meetings will be overseen by Sarah Friar, OpenAI's CFO.\n\nThis move comes amid mounting pressure from regulatory bodies, including the European Commission and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The European Commission recently hinted at a possible antitrust investigation into Microsoft and OpenAI's partnership, while the FTC is also scrutinizing investments by major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in generative AI startups.\n\nDespite the absence of a formal board role, Apple and OpenAI will continue their collaboration. Siri will be enhanced to transfer complex user requests to ChatGPT, provided users give explicit permission. Notably, no financial transactions are involved in this integration deal; both companies are focusing on technological synergy rather than monetary exchange.\n\nThe move reflects the broader challenges and regulatory pressures facing the tech industry as it navigates the integration of advanced AI technologies.

The Satya Nadella-led company said that governance within OpenAI had become much better in the past eight months. Last month, it was reported that Apple will take an observer board role in OpenAI. Microsoft had a non-voting, observer position in the OpenAI board. It gave Microsoft access to OpenAI's board meetings and confidential information but no voting rights on important decisions.\n\nSince CEO Sam Altman was fired and reinstated, the company has refreshed their board members. A spokesperson for OpenAI said they will introduce a new engagement approach by hosting regular stakeholder meetings with strategic partners like Microsoft, Apple and investors like Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\n\nSamsung South Korean union to strike indefinitely\n\nA workers' union at South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics said that they will extend their strike indefinitely as they push for better pay and benefits. The three-day strike began with workers demanding better pay on the first day and now wants to amp up as the company doesn't accommodate them. The National Samsung Electronics Union or NSEU which has almost 30,000 members is almost a quarter of the firm's workforce in South Korea, has also demanded for an extra day of annual leave for unionised workers and changes to the employee bonus system.\n\nExperts however have said that the strike is not expected to have a massive impact on the company because of automated manufacturing and fewer workers participating in it. Last month, the union performed a mass walkout but Samsung said that it made no impact on the business.\n\nChina leads globally at GenAI adoption\n\nChina is leading globally in adoption of generative AI; a survey that included 1,500 decision-makers from across the world. Recent reports have demonstrated China's advancement when it comes to building and using GenAI. According to this survey, 83% of Chinese respondents said that they used GenAI. In comparison, the U.S. said that 65% of respondents said they had adopted GenAI while the global average was 54%.\n\nThe industries included were banking, insurance, healthcare, telecom, manufacturing, retail and energy. Experts say that the adoption of GenAI in China will push the prices of AI technologies even lower due to a price war.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ul24d/article68388595.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-07-03T160102Z_391778645_RC26T6A1GU8B_RTRMADP_3_MICROSOFT-DISCRIMINATION.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.\n\nEU antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subjected to the bloc's merger rules because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement.\n\nIn contrast, the UK and U.S. antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the latter's independence.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft is expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform and has hired Inflection's CEO to head its consumer AI division, a move widely interpreted as an effort to diversify beyond OpenAI.

Spokespeople for OpenAI and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe rise of OpenAI and other AI startups such as Anthropic, spurred by interest in ChatGPT and other chatbots, shook up the tech industry last year. Analysts and tech leaders have suggested that the newcomers could usurp some of the power of dominant players such as Microsoft.\n\nBut OpenAI and other leading AI startups have become dependent on investment from the largest tech companies because of the immense costs of developing cutting-edge AI. Algorithms behind systems like ChatGPT are trained using expensive and power-hungry computer hardware.\n\nMicrosoft invested billions in OpenAI in early 2023, while Anthropic took on funding from Google and Amazon last year as well. But those deals have drawn attention from regulators. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nIn January, the Federal Trade Commission said it would look into whether the investments and partnerships between AI companies and Big Tech are stifling true competition.\n\n\"Our study will shed light on whether investments and partnerships pursued by dominant companies risk distorting innovation and undermining fair competition,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement at the time.\n\nOpenAI has been hiring lawyers and lobbyists at a rapid pace as it has grown and faced more legal and regulatory pressure. The company is facing a growing number of lawsuits from news organizations, authors, and other content creators who say the company used their copyrighted work to train its AI algorithms without payment or permission.\n\nDespite its prominence, OpenAI's business is still nascent, and it needs to find many more customers if it is to turn a profit. Forming alliances with Big Tech can help AI startups gain access to billions of paying customers around the world, an easier path than developing new products from scratch.\n\nOpenAI and Apple framed their recent deal as mutually beneficial, with Apple enhancing the iPhone by providing access to ChatGPT and OpenAI getting its technology introduced to users of Apple phones and computers.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Bezos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer hardware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/hrjdBJdMWaebqJ1OQj1x7Urtn_Y=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/52AD25BAY2OG6CQPUHXTY73HGA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

While Microsoft may have \"scored a 'win'\" in June when the EU Commission said it was dropping its probe into Microsoft and Open AI, the powerful regulator made it clear it was still looking at the relationships between companies in the AI space and it remains \"very much focussed on the complex web of interrelationships that big tech has created with AI providers.\" With that in mind, Haffner said there's a need for \"Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward.\"\n\nWhile Big Tech thrived under minimal antitrust scrutiny for a decade, Silicon Valley's giants have found their immense influence and size under pressure from global competition regulators in recent years, including the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S. Investigations and enforcement have focused on areas central to the digital economy and include the way tech companies like Apple and Google dominate online marketplaces and apps; the way firms like Meta approach privacy and advertising; and anti-competitive acquisitions, such as Microsoft's $69 billion purchase of gaming studio Blizzard. The boom of interest in generative AI, kickstarted with the launch of OpenAI's chatbot assistant ChatGPT in late 2022, has prompted a race to develop increasingly sophisticated AI tools that has consumed tech giants and upstarts alike. It has produced tools like OpenAI's Sora, Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot, Adobe's Firefly and Anthropic's Claude and sparked fears of the technology's implications on jobs and its ability to spread misinformation. Antitrust regulators are concerned over the potential of giant players like chipmaker Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon hindering smaller players. Microsoft, for example, has found itself under scrutiny in Europe and the U.S. for its AI dealmaking, which includes a $13 billion investment in OpenAI and its $4 billion \"acqui-hire\" of startup Inflection, Google faces a probe over plans to preinstall its Gemini AI on Samsung phones and Amazon for its $4 billion investment in Anthropic.\n\nAltman has an estimated net worth of $1 billion. His fortune primarily comes from his role as a venture investor and not from OpenAI, which he does not have equity in. Before starting OpenAI, Altman founded social mapping company Loopt and was a partner and president at tech startup accelerator Y Combinator, which he left in order to focus on the AI startup. His investments include stakes in fintech darling Stripe, social media platform Reddit and nuclear fusion venture Helion.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"},

But that awkward situation has suddenly been averted.\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI's biggest partner and investor, has been a board observer since last year's leadership crisis, in which Microsoft and everyone else were shocked by OpenAI's board abruptly and briefly firing CEO Sam Altman. And, as I wrote last week, Apple, which plans to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, was reportedly about to get the same privilege.\n\nHowever, it emerged today that Microsoft has dropped its observer role with immediate effect, and Apple won't take one either. Microsoft reportedly told OpenAI in a letter that its seven months observing meetings \"provided insights into the board's activities without compromising its independence,\" and the role was no longer necessary because \"we have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\"\n\nInstead of having board observers, OpenAI said it will now just hold regular meetings with its strategic partners and investors. This seems a far more sensible approach, for multiple reasons.\n\nFirstly, while European antitrust officials earlier this year dropped a probe into Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI -- they conceded Microsoft had not taken control of its partner -- there's now a broader EU review taking place, covering strategic investments and partnerships across the entire AI industry. Regulators in the U.K. and U.S. are also paying close attention. This is not a time for Microsoft and OpenAI to appear overly cozy.\n\nSecondly...well, here I'm going to hand things over Data Sheet reader JE, who wrote me this in response to last week's essay about the subject:\n\n\"The issue of letting major customers sit in on board meetings would seem to raise all kinds of issues. As the retired chair of the board of a publicly traded company, I would have real concerns about how we could have functioned with customers or even large shareholders sitting in on what should be candid, serious and confidential discussions...I question how this 'observation' can be helpful if open ended. Having input and discussion for a defined topic and time in meetings with customers is fine; attending meetings as an observer or participant is not.\"\n\nDoubly so if two competing customers like Microsoft and Apple are both in the room, I imagine.\n\nSince we're on the subject of AI, Elon Musk's xAI startup has decided to build its own data center systems rather than continuing its server rental agreement with Oracle. The Information had the scoop and the man himself confirmed it on X, where he said xAI's only chance of catching up with more established rivals was to move faster than them.\n\n\"Oracle is a great company...but, when our fate depends on being the fastest by far, we must have our own hands on the steering wheel, rather than be a backseat driver,\" Musk tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has for the first time accused another country of using generative AI in a foreign influence campaign, Reuters reports. You will be shocked to hear that Russia is the alleged miscreant -- a Russian organization apparently designed an AI-powered bot farm to spread disinformation in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nFinally, Fortune AI maestro Jeremy Kahn has a new book out! It's called Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future and I for one can't wait to read it. We published an excerpt yesterday -- which appropriately focuses on AI's potential for surreptitiously influencing people -- and you can also read Jeremy's own rundown of the book's key themes in yesterday's Eye On AI essay.\n\nSamsung strike extended. Unionized Samsung workers in South Korea, who this week held an unprecedented three-day strike over pay and benefits, have now extended the strike indefinitely. According to Reuters, it's unclear to what extent the strike has already slowed memory chip production -- the unions say partly; Samsung says not at all -- but the ultimate aim is to completely stop production lines.\n\nTSMC sales surge. TSMC, the company that makes Nvidia and Apple's chips for them, is doing pretty nicely out of the AI boom. Bloomberg reports that TSMC's Q2 sales were up 40%, far in excess of the average 35.5% that analysts were expecting. TSMC recently briefly cleared $1 trillion in market cap, and may soon do so again.\n\nMeta's new \"Zionists\" policy. Meta is cracking down more on the use of the term \"Zionists\" on its platforms, pledging to remove it where it's being used as a (generally hateful) proxy for Jewish or Israeli people. As CNN reports, the company will still allow the term when it explicitly refers to the political movement of that name.\n\n-- The number of electric vehicles that JPMorgan Chase expects China's BYD to sell in the next two years. As a result, the bank has raised its share price targets for the company by more than 80% (the stock trades on the Hong Kong and Shenzhen exchanges).\n\nThe VC behind Mistral, Revolut, and Slack just raised $2.3 billion to invest in long-term AI champions: 'The era of the quick buck mentality is over', by Prarthana Prakash\n\nA new Illinois law will force influencer parents to compensate their children for appearing in social media content, by Chris Morris\n\nExclusive: Canoe Intelligence raises $36 million for Series C led by Goldman Sachs, by Allie Garfinkle\n\nNew Hollywood power player David Ellison outlines his 'essential' vision for Paramount to transition into a 'tech hybrid', by the Associated Press\n\nWhy Lyft and Twitch succeeded while Quibi and Kodak failed -- and why smart entrepreneurs focus on inflections, by Mike Maples, Jr. and Peter Ziebelman (Commentary)\n\n'All workers deserve a union': Ride-hailing drivers in Massachusetts are advancing a first-of-its-kind ballot question to gain union rights, by the Associated Press\n\nPC shipments grow.

Bitwise CCO Katherine Dowling says Ethereum ETF applications are nearing the finish line. Meanwhile, the sentencing of two former FTX executives is planned for October and November this year. Here are three significant developments in the crypto market over the past 24 hours.\n\nContentsMicrosoft and Apple Make Notable MoveNotable Figure Comments on ETFNew Development in FTX Case Microsoft and Apple Make Notable Move\n\nTech giants Microsoft and Apple reportedly decided not to join the OpenAI board due to increasing regulatory scrutiny. According to a Bloomberg report on July 10, citing an anonymous source, Microsoft sent a letter to OpenAI announcing its withdrawal from the board.\n\nThe withdrawal occurred about a year after the Windows software maker made a massive $13 billion investment in OpenAI in April 2023. In its note to OpenAI, Microsoft stated:\n\n\"Over the past eight months, we have witnessed significant progress in the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\"\n\nContrary to recent reports suggesting that Apple would take an observer role on the OpenAI board as part of a significant deal announced in June, the company said OpenAI would not have a board observer after Microsoft's departure.\n\nNotable Figure Comments on ETF\n\nBitwise compliance officer Katherine Dowling says the list of eight spot Ethereum ETF applications is nearing its final launch date as mutual disputes between potential fund issuers and the SEC begin to slow down:\n\n\"We see fewer issues being reviewed between issuers and the SEC in S-1 amendments. This indicates that all signs point to us being close. We are nearing the finish line for the launch.\"\n\nBitwise's chief investment officer Matt Hougan estimated that spot Ethereum ETF funds could attract up to $15 billion in inflows within the first 18 months, roughly the same amount spot Bitcoin ETF funds have gathered since their launch six months ago.\n\nNew Development in FTX Case\n\nA US federal judge overseeing the trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried scheduled sentencing hearings for Gary Wang and Nishad Singh later this year. According to a docket entry on July 9 in the Southern District of New York, Judge Lewis Kaplan said Singh's sentencing would be on October 30, and Wang's sentencing would be on November 20. Gary Wang was a co-founder of the bankrupt crypto exchange. Singh served as the director of engineering during the bankruptcy.\n\nWang was among the first to admit to charges related to his role in FTX's bankruptcy. Singh also admitted to various serious charges, including fraud and money laundering, in February 2023. The fallout from FTX's bankruptcy led to the former co-CEO of FTX Markets, Ryan Salame, being sentenced to 7.5 years in prison in May this year.\n\nYou can follow our news on Telegram, Facebook, Twitter & Coinmarketcap Disclaimer: The information contained in this article does not constitute investment advice.

Apple has also stepped away, despite previously planning to pin its name on one of the startup's spinning office chairs. But this distance might have something to do with the heat coming from both European and US regulators. They're concerned that Big Tech companies are wielding too much power, especially in the potentially world-changing AI sector. Mind you, Microsoft has hardly cut the cord: the firm's $13 billion investment in OpenAI entitles it to a chunk of profit for some time, and it's still making bank from the startup's reliance on its Azure computing services.\n\nTSMC joined its fellow AI explorers in the exclusive trillion-dollar club this week. As the sole supplier of advanced AI chips for Nvidia and Apple, the Taiwanese chipmaker already had investors under its spell. And that won't be broken anytime soon: TSMC announced on Wednesday that last quarter's sales were a better-than-expected 40% higher than the same time a year ago.\n\nThe bigger picture: Money's no object... yet.\n\nBig Tech companies are spending whatever they need to secure chips, data centers, and innovative technology in the pursuit of super-smart systems. But maybe they should watch the budget: skeptics doubt that AI will be all it's cracked up to be, and Big Tech has gambled on anticlimactic technologies before.

Now, Apple is walking back that decision, the FT said, citing a source with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nPYMNTS has contacted both companies for comment but has not yet gotten a reply.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told the news outlet that the company will instead hold regular meetings with partners like Apple and Microsoft and its investors, in \"a new approach to informing and engaging key strategic partners.\"\n\nThe decision is happening at a time when Big Tech's investments in AI companies have drawn the attention of regulators.\n\nFor example, the UK's antitrust watchdogs are looking into the partnerships between Microsoft and Amazon and smaller AI companies, an inquiry that -- as PYMNTS has written -- could alter the landscape of the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nSome experts contend that a strict antitrust ruling may not only change how major corporations do business with emerging AI firms but could also lessen enthusiasm for new partnerships, possibly hindering innovation.\n\n\"A direct ruling that prohibits exclusive partnerships or creates substantial barriers to building direct partnerships between generative AI companies and the major tech companies will likely make capital more difficult to obtain and would therefore slow their growth,\" Ryan M.

Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company would establish a new approach to engaging with stakeholders by hosting regular meetings with strategic partners such as Microsoft and Apple, and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\n\nMicrosoft took a non-voting, observer position on OpenAI's board in November after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company.\n\nThe seat meant Microsoft could attend OpenAI's board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors.\n\nThe observer seat and Microsoft's more than US$10 billion ($14.8 billion) investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in the European Union, Britain and the US over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.\n\nThe position provided insights into the board's work without compromising its independence, Microsoft said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.\n\nIt cited OpenAI's new partnerships, innovation and growing customer base since Altman's return to the startup as reasons for giving up its observer seat.\n\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction. Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\" it said in the letter.\n\nEU antitrust regulators last month said the partnership would not be subject to the bloc's merger rules because Microsoft does not control OpenAI, but they would instead seek third-party views on the exclusivity clauses in the agreement.\n\nIn contrast, British and US antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft's influence over OpenAI and the latter's independence.\n\nBill Baer, a former US antitrust official and visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that it seemed the risk of simultaneous antitrust investigations outweighed the benefit of being an observer on the OpenAI board.\n\n\"That looks like the right call,\" he said, but added that regulators' concerns seem to go beyond the board seat.\n\nMicrosoft is making a smart move by removing the only tangible evidence of possible control/influence over OpenAI, making it very difficult for antitrust regulators to prove otherwise, said an antitrust lawyer who declined to be named due to industry sensitivities.\n\nBritain's Competition and Markets Authority declined to comment.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft is expanding its AI offerings on the Azure platform and has hired the CEO of tech company Inflection to head its consumer AI division, a move widely interpreted as an effort to diversify beyond OpenAI.", "source": {"uri": "itnews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "iTnews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "foo_yun_chee@itnews.com.au", "name": "Foo Yun

The tech giant will remain the largest investor in OpenAI, with a 49 percent stake. It has committed to invest $13 billion in the artificial intelligence company that developed ChatGPT, which has become the world's most popular chatbot because of its ability to answer questions, create images and write software code.\n\nThis week, OpenAI also told key investors and business partners that it would begin meeting with them on a quarterly basis, an OpenAI spokesman said. Those meetings will be open to investors, including Microsoft and the venture firms Khosla Ventures and Thrive Capital, as well as Apple, which recently struck a deal to make ChatGPT available on iPhones later this year.\n\n(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The companies have disputed those claims.)\n\nMicrosoft joined OpenAI's board late last year as a nonvoting observer. It came weeks after OpenAI's board fired and then reinstated Sam Altman as OpenAI's chief executive. In the wake of that upheaval, OpenAI remade its board, bringing on four new directors.\n\nIn the letter to OpenAI, Keith Dolliver, Microsoft's corporate secretary, said that the company had decided its role on the board was unnecessary because it had \"witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company's direction.\"\n\nMicrosoft's decision coincides with European and U.S. regulators' examination of its ties to OpenAI. In March, Europe's antitrust enforcer, the European Commission, sent questions to Microsoft, Google, Meta and others about their investments in A.I. startups. It has since sent follow-up questions to Microsoft about its investment in OpenAI because it is concerned about how dominant companies could block smaller competitors from gaining access to A.I. technology.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is embarking on an investigation into the Microsoft and OpenAI partnership, which has raised questions about whether it was structured to allow Microsoft to avoid a regulatory review.\n\nOver the years, Microsoft has sought to avoid confrontation and instead has compromised with regulators. It managed to close a $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the video game publisher, in the more muscular regulatory environment by agreeing to offer games on rival consoles and license current and future games to a rival publisher.\n\nKaren Weise contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrive_Capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thrive Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosla_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khosla Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Activision Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_publisher", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game publisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/10/multimedia/10openai-microsoft-chlw/10openai-microsoft-chlw-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716619", "eventUri": "eng-9716619", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 458340521, "relevance": 2}

The organization plans to hold \"regular stakeholder meetings to share progress on our mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security.\"\n\nOpenAI Board Restructures Amid Regulatory Scrutiny of Microsoft's $10 Billion Investment and Partnership\n\nThe composition of OpenAI's board has been altered in response to the increasing antitrust concerns regarding Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI in recent months. Shortly following the turmoil that resulted in the ousting of CEO Sam Altman and his subsequent return, UK regulators initiated inquiries regarding Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI in December.\n\nAccording to The Verge, the partnership is also under investigation by EU regulators, and Big Tech has initiated other AI agreements.

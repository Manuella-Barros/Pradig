Suspended Sioux City inclusion liaison accuses human rights director of harassment, defamation Names released in deadly North Sioux City fire Bill Murray makes lasting impression while in Omaha for Berkshire Hathaway meeting Sioux City cultural inclusion liaison settles lawsuit with USD\n\nAmong Biden's recruits is Amanda Zurawski, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against Texas seeking clarity on the state's three overlapping abortion laws. The confusion has been cleared up in nonpartisan state legislation, but not in time to help Zurawski and 19 other women who have joined the suit.\n\nZurawski's horrific experience during a doomed pregnancy is a textbook case of what can go wrong when legislators think they know better than doctors about medical science. Zurawski was 18 weeks pregnant when her water broke, an event that puts the mother at great risk of infection.\n\nBefore Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Zurawski would have had an abortion. Baby Willow had no chance to survive at just 18 weeks, and health-of-the-mother considerations would have prevailed. But because the fetus still had a heartbeat, doctors assumed Texas law would not allow the abortion. Only when Zurawski developed sepsis, with a dangerously high fever and low blood pressure, would doctors treat her. She spent several days in the intensive care unit recovering from her near-death experience.\n\nNot surprisingly, Zurawski and her husband Josh emerged from this ordeal with arms swinging. They've told their story many times, testifying in Washington. Amanda Zurawski, among others, joined first lady Jill Biden in her box at the State of the Union. It's fair to say she has become the face of the Democratic Party's revolt against Dobbs, the Supreme Court decision reversing Roe v. Wade .\n\nBut Zurawski and her co-plaintiffs are not yet finished in court. They're asking the Texas Supreme Court to create a new \"good-faith judgment\" exception for medical emergencies, instead of the current standards of \"reasonable medical judgment,\" or what most doctors would do in a given circumstance.\n\nShifting to \"good-faith judgment,\" as Carter Snead, a professor of law at Notre Dame, explained to me, would set a purely subjective standard based on what the abortion provider believes. In other words, it could allow unlimited elective abortion.\n\nIn the nearly two years since Dobbs, states have responded with widely varying approaches. Texas, Florida and others have enacted restrictive laws. Elsewhere, it's the Wild West. Six states and Washington, D.C., impose no term restrictions on abortion at all. Montana rejected protections for babies who survive abortion.\n\nThe claim by some activists that women would not be treated for ectopic pregnancies is just not true.\n\nI have enormous empathy for the Texas women. At the same time, I'm unable to pretend that a fetus, which is Latin for \"little one,\" isn't a human being whose life, like everyone's, is a work in progress. Our collective inability to recognize and respect both perspectives might be our greatest obstacle to truly helping women and babies.\n\nBiden's surrogates will keep telling their stories as their usefulness wanes. Biden will continue taking Communion in his little Delaware church, consuming the host despite the church's policy against Communion for people who publicly promote abortion.\n\nAnd Donald Trump will continue bragging, \"I did it!\" about his role in Roe's reversal. Funny. That's what Zurawski says: \"Trump did this!\" If the stakes weren't so high, this would be comical. Given that at least some people will choose their home states -- and students their universities -- according to the relative restrictiveness of abortion law, it is plausible that the Southeast will be left to post-fertile adults.\n\nAs I write from South Carolina, this seems not the worst of outcomes.\n\nParker writes for The Washington Post.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "siouxcityjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sioux City Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_City,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sioux_City,_South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Sioux City, South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Sioux City, South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dear_Abby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dear Abby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rosary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sioux_City,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Sioux City, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Sioux City, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The confusion has been cleared up in nonpartisan state legislation, but not in time to help Zurawski and 19 other women who have joined the suit.\n\nZurawski's horrific experience during a doomed pregnancy is a textbook case of what can go wrong when legislators think they know better than doctors about medical science. Zurawski was 18 weeks pregnant when her water broke, an event that puts the mother at great risk of infection.\n\nBefore Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Zurawski would have had an abortion. Baby Willow had no chance to survive at just 18 weeks, and health-of-the-mother considerations would have prevailed. But because the fetus still had a heartbeat, doctors assumed Texas law would not allow the abortion. Only when Zurawski developed sepsis, with a dangerously high fever and low blood pressure, would doctors treat her. She spent several days in the intensive care unit recovering from her near-death experience.\n\nNot surprisingly, Zurawski and her husband Josh emerged from this ordeal with arms swinging. They've told their story many times, testifying in Washington. Amanda Zurawski, among others, joined first lady Jill Biden in her box at the State of the Union. It's fair to say she has become the face of the Democratic Party's revolt against Dobbs, the Supreme Court decision reversing Roe v. Wade .\n\nBut Zurawski and her co-plaintiff s are not yet finished in court. They're asking the Texas Supreme Court to create a new \"good-faith judgment\" exception for medical emergencies, instead of the current standards of \"reasonable medical judgment,\" or what most doctors would do in a given circumstance.\n\nShifting to \"good-faith judgment,\" as Carter Snead, a professor of law at Notre Dame, explained to me, would set a purely subjective standard based on what the abortion provider believes. In other words, it could allow unlimited elective abortion.\n\nIn the nearly two years since Dobbs, states have responded with widely varying approaches. Texas, Florida and others have enacted restrictive laws. Elsewhere, it's the Wild West. Six states and Washington, D.C., impose no term restrictions on abortion at all. Montana rejected protections for babies who survive abortion.\n\nThe claim by some activists that women would not be treated for ectopic pregnancies is just not true.\n\nI have enormous empathy for the Texas women. At the same time, I'm unable to pretend that a fetus, which is Latin for \"little one,\" isn't a human being whose life, like everyone's, is a work in progress. Our collective inability to recognize and respect both perspectives might be our greatest obstacle to truly helping women and babies.\n\nBiden's surrogates will keep telling their stories as their usefulness wanes. Biden will continue taking Communion in his little Delaware church, consuming the host despite the church's policy against Communion for people who publicly promote abortion.\n\nAnd Donald Trump will continue bragging, \"I did it!\" about his role in Roe's reversal. Funny. That's what Zurawski says: \"Trump did this!\" If the stakes weren't so high, this would be comical. Given that at least some people will choose their home states -- and students their universities -- according to the relative restrictiveness of abortion law, it is plausible that the Southeast will be left to post-fertile adults.\n\nAs I write from South Carolina, this seems not the worst of outcomes.\n\nParker writes for The Washington Post.\n\nTags Politics Medicine Law Legislation Christianity Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "napavalleyregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Napa Valley Register"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Napa County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Napa County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_80", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 80"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rosary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

I wonder whether Joe Biden has nightmares as he recruits abortion-denied women to serve as surrogates to make his case.\n\nOnce a proud pro-life Democrat, Biden has become a modern-day gladiator for abortion, even if he can't bring himself to say the word. During his State of the Union address in March, the president all but danced an Irish jig around the term, speaking instead of protecting reproductive freedom. His discomfort was telling.\n\nThis is, of course, between him and his maker, but my guess is Biden realizes he has made a bargain with the wrong guy and must atone however he can -- except, of course, by being true to his convictions and, at 82, sacrificing his (fourth) bid for the presidency in the service of his faith. Biden can't make his Catholicism part of his campaign, frequently telling people he always keeps a rosary in his pocket and then expect not to be critiqued when he betrays that faith.\n\nPeople are also reading...

(Scripps News)\n\nAbortion restrictions and bans enacted in many states have created very real and frightening problems for many women. One of them is Amanda Zurawski of Austin, Texas.\n\nShe became pregnant after 18 months of fertility treatment in late 2022. Complications led to a miscarriage. But because of Texas law, she was denied abortion care. She later went into septic shock and nearly died twice.\n\nZurawski is the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against Texas, whose Supreme Court has promised to issue a decision next month.\n\nShe has shared her story with lawmakers, in a Biden campaign ad and today in Michigan, as the Biden campaign focuses on reproductive rights.\n\nZurawski spoke with Scripps News about sharing her story and working to reach women and voters in battleground states like Michigan.\n\n\"It's really important to share stories like mine and those of so many others in this country because it helps put a face to the trauma and the grief and the harm that's being waged on pregnant people across this country,\" Zurawski said. \"We know Michigan is a battleground state. We know that Michiganders are pro-choice, we know that they support access to abortion. And so we are here encouraging them to continue fighting and ultimately show up for the polls in November.\"\n\nAbortion is intensely personal and increasingly political\n\n\"The story that you hear from me and from so many other women sounds extreme, but unfortunately it's not,\" Zurawski said. \"And as we're out campaigning we hear over and over again from folks who either experienced something similar or they know someone who has or they're afraid that they're going to. And this is the story of so many of us who are suffering because of the policies that Donald Trump supports.\"\n\nPath to the White House\n\nVP Harris elevates abortion rights advocacy in reelection campaign Serena Marshall 2:32 PM, May 06, 2024\n\nTexas' Supreme Court case is just one battle\n\n\"I think ultimately what we expect to see is folks in Texas and beyond be really motivated by this issue and by what's going on not just in Texas but across the country,\" Zurawski said. \"There are 22 of us on my lawsuit but we represent a very, very small fraction of folks who have been harmed, and who will continue to be harmed if we don't fix this issue and show up and reelect President Biden and Vice President Harris this November.\"", "source": {"uri": "10news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scripps News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Septic shock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Tukong_Moosul", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Tukong Moosul", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8cec28b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdd%2F48%2F121aef8246cba7d559ddfab698c9%2Fap24023788547679.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547670", "eventUri": "eng-9547670", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2006-05-", "textStart": 2072, "textEnd": 2078}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The experience has led the mother of one and her husband, Landon, to decide for now not to have more children.\n\nAbortions in New Hampshire are legal through six months. After that point they can only occur if the mother's health is at risk or if the fetus has a fatal anomaly.\n\nNew Hampshire is the only New England state without a law that expressly endorses the right to an abortion.\n\nThe Republican-led Legislature has repeatedly rejected bills to make that change.\n\nThe ban on later-term abortions here was adopted as part of a trailer bill to the state budget in 2021.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump had considered coming out in support of some abortion ban, but he ultimately decided that states should determine their own regulations with regards to

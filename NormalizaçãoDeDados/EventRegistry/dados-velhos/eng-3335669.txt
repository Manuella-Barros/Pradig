on the opening weekend of the Championship on Saturday.\n\nBrazilian striker Bonatini, signed on a season-long loan from Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, punished a mistake from Boro defender Daniel Ayala to settle a tight encounter in the 33rd minute at Molineux.\n\nIt was an encouraging result for Wolves, who are among the leading contenders for promotion to the Premier League after a major close-season overhaul.\n\nFormer Porto midfielder Ruben Neves cost Wolves a Championship record \u00a315million and he impressed on his first appearance under new boss Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\nIt was a frustrating return to the second tier for Middlesbrough after last season's relegation and Garry Monk's side will have to improve significantly to live up to their billing as the bookmakers' favourites for promotion.\n\nBobby Reid netted a brace and Famara Diedhiou scored on his first appearance as Bristol City beat Barnsley 3-1 at Ashton Gate.\n\nReid put the hosts ahead after 16 minutes before setting up Senegal striker Diedhiou, a club-record \u00a35.3 million signing from Angers, who headed home at the back post.\n\nCity midfielder Reid then added his second of the day from close range on the half-hour mark as the Robins ran riot in the first period.\n\nRyan Hedges pulled a goal back for Barnsley in stoppage-time.\n\nRocked by last week's 6-1 friendly thrashing at the hands of third tier Charlton, Ipswich restored their pride with a 1-0 victory over Birmingham at Portman Road.\n\nJoe Garner was the Ipswich match-winner in the 47th minute, calmly converting from just outside the six-yard box.\n\nSuffering a hangover from last season's painful play-off final defeat against Huddersfield, Reading slumped to a 2-0 defeat at QPR.\n\nConor Washington headed in from close range on 22 minutes and slotted home a penalty 14 minutes into the second half after Reading's Tiago Ilori was sent off for a foul on Pawel Wszolek.\n\nNorwich's Nelson Oliveira equalised two minutes from full-time to salvage a 1-1 draw at Fulham.\n\nRussell Martin's own goal from Floyd Ayite's cross had put the hosts ahead on 25 minutes.\n\nBut substitute Oliveira beat the offside trap to earn the Canaries a point in new manager Daniel Farke's first game in charge.\n\nDaniel Johnson's 79th minute penalty secured Preston's first opening-day win since 2008 as they beat Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 at Deepdale.\n\nJohnson's spot-kick, awarded after Jordan Hugill was brought down by Tom Lees, ensured new Preston manager Alex Neil made a winning start after succeeding Simon Grayson.\n\nSheffield United marked their return to the second tier after a six-year absence with a 1-0 victory over Brentford.\n\nBlades skipper Billy Sharp headed the winner in the 39th minute at Bramall Lane.\n\nDanish forward Kenneth Zohore struck in the 87th minute to give Cardiff a 1-0 victory at Burton.", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Leo Bonatini debut goal

Ryan Hedges pulled a goal back for Barnsley in added time but it was not enough to deny Bristol City boss Lee Johnson victory against his former club.\n\nBilly Sharp picked up where he left off last season by scoring the only goal in Sheffield United's 1-0 win over Brentford at Bramall Lane. The striker netted 30 goals in League One last term and took just 39 minutes to open his account for the new campaign - the Blades' first in the second tier for six years.\n\nJoe Garner also got off to the perfect start by scoring on his Ipswich debut in the 1-0 victory at home against Birmingham. The former Rangers striker completed a counter-attack five minutes after half-time to seal three points for the Tractor Boys at Portman Road.\n\nConor Washington fared even better as he scored twice in QPR's 2-0 win over 10-man Reading at Loftus Road. The ex-Peterborough forward headed the hosts into the lead on 22 minutes and converted a penalty on the hour mark after Royals defender Tiago Ilori was sent off.\n\nDaniel Johnson's second-half penalty helped Preston to a 1-0 victory at home to Sheffield Wednesday while Kenneth Zohore netted a late winner in Cardiff's 1-0 triumph at Burton.\n\nElsewhere, Fulham were the beneficiaries of a 25th-minute Russell Martin own goal but Nelson Oliveira stepped off the bench to earn a 1-1 draw for Norwich at Craven Cottage.\n\nAston Villa face Hull in the late game on Saturday, while on Friday night Nottingham Forest beat Millwall 1-0 and Sunderland drew 1-1 with Derby.\n\nAlso See: Championship video Fixtures Table Live on Sky Get Sky Sports", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate":

the Championship on Saturday.\n\nBrazilian striker Bonatini, signed on a season-long loan from Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, punished a mistake from Boro defender Daniel Ayala to settle a tight encounter in the 33rd minute at Molineux.\n\nIt was an encouraging result for Wolves, who are among the leading contenders for promotion to the Premier League after a major close-season overhaul.\n\nFormer Porto midfielder Ruben Neves cost Wolves a Championship record \u00a315million and he impressed on his first appearance under new boss Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\nIt was a frustrating return to the second tier for Middlesbrough after last season's relegation and Garry Monk's side will have to improve significantly to live up to their billing as the bookmakers' favourites for promotion.\n\nBobby Reid netted a brace and Famara Diedhiou scored on his first appearance as Bristol City beat Barnsley 3-1 at Ashton Gate.\n\nReid put the hosts ahead after 16 minutes before setting up Senegal striker Diedhiou, a club-record \u00a35.3 million signing from Angers, who headed home at the back post.\n\nCity midfielder Reid then added his second of the day from close range on the half-hour mark as the Robins ran riot in the first period.\n\nRyan Hedges pulled a goal back for Barnsley in stoppage-time.\n\nRocked by last week's 6-1 friendly thrashing at the hands of third tier Charlton, Ipswich restored their pride with a 1-0 victory over Birmingham at Portman Road.\n\nJoe Garner was the Ipswich match-winner in the 47th minute, calmly converting from just outside the six-yard box.\n\nSuffering a hangover from last season's painful play-off final defeat against Huddersfield, Reading slumped to a 2-0 defeat at QPR.\n\nConor Washington headed in from close range on 22 minutes and slotted home a penalty 14 minutes into the second half after Reading's Tiago Ilori was sent off for a foul on Pawel Wszolek.\n\nNorwich's Nelson Oliveira equalised two minutes from full-time to salvage a 1-1 draw at Fulham.\n\nRussell Martin's own goal from Floyd Ayite's cross had put the hosts ahead on 25 minutes.\n\nBut substitute Oliveira beat the offside trap to earn the Canaries a point in new manager Daniel Farke's first game in charge.\n\nDaniel Johnson's 79th minute penalty secured Preston's first opening-day win since 2008 as they beat Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 at Deepdale.\n\nJohnson's spot-kick, awarded after Jordan Hugill was brought down by Tom Lees, ensured new Preston manager Alex Neil made a winning start after succeeding Simon Grayson.\n\nSheffield United marked their return to the second tier after a six-year absence with a 1-0 victory over Brentford.\n\nBlades skipper Billy Sharp headed the winner in the 39th minute at Bramall Lane.\n\nDanish

star's new side were held to a 1-1 draw by Hull on the opening weekend of the Championship season.\n\nAfter winning 15 major honours in 22 years with Chelsea, Terry is making a fresh start with Villa following his release by the Premier League champions at the end of last season.\n\nTerry's switch to Steve Bruce's side has made them among the favourites for promotion from the second tier.\n\nBut the former England defender's first Championship appearance since a loan spell with Nottingham Forest 17 years ago couldn't inspire Villa to kick off their season with a victory.\n\nGabriel Agbonlahor's seventh-minute goal gave Terry and company the perfect start at Villa Park.\n\nBut Hull, back in the Championship after last season's relegation, found their stride in the second half, deservedly equalising through 20-year-old Jarrod Bowen's first goal for the club.\n\nAndre Green should have put Villa back in front with 10 minutes remaining, but got his header all wrong from two yards out to leave Terry to settle for a point.\n\nBig-spending Wolves made a strong start to their promotion bid as Leo Bonatini's debut goal sealed a 1-0 win over Middlesbrough.\n\nBrazilian striker Bonatini, signed on a season-long loan from Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, punished a mistake from Boro defender Daniel Ayala to settle a tight encounter in the 33rd minute at Molineux.\n\nIt was an encouraging result for Wolves, who are among the leading contenders for promotion to the Premier League after a major close-season overhaul.\n\nFormer Porto midfielder Ruben Neves cost Wolves a Championship record \u00a315million and he impressed on his first appearance under new boss Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\nIt was a frustrating return to the second tier for Middlesbrough after last season's relegation.\n\nBobby Reid netted a brace and Famara Diedhiou scored on his first appearance as Bristol City beat Barnsley 3-1 at Ashton Gate.\n\nReid put the hosts ahead after 16 minutes before setting up Senegal striker Diedhiou, a club-record \u00a35.3 million signing from Angers, who headed home at the back post.\n\nReid then added his second of the day before Ryan Hedges pulled a goal back for Barnsley in stoppage-time.\n\nRocked by last week's 6-1 friendly thrashing at the hands of third tier Charlton, Ipswich restored their pride with a 1-0 victory over Birmingham at Portman Road.\n\nSuffering a hangover from last season's painful play-off final defeat against Huddersfield, Reading slumped to a 2-0 defeat at QPR.\n\nNorwich's Nelson Oliveira equalised two minutes from full-time to salvage a 1-1 draw at Fulham.\n\nDaniel Johnson's 79th minute penalty secured Preston's first opening-day win since 2008 as they beat Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 at Deepdale.\n\nSheffield United marked their return to the second tier after a six-year absence with a 1-0 victory over Brentford.\n\nDanish forward Kenneth Zohore struck in the 87th minute to give Cardiff a 1-0 victory at Burton.", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "John Terry frustrated as Hull hold Villa - Vanguard News", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15601132",

star's new side were held to a 1-1 draw by Hull on the opening weekend of the Championship season.\n\nAfter winning 15 major honours in 22 years with Chelsea, Terry is making a fresh start with Villa following his release by the Premier League champions at the end of last season.\n\nTerry's switch to Steve Bruce's side has made them among the favourites for promotion from the second tier.\n\nBut the former England defender's first Championship appearance since a loan spell with Nottingham Forest 17 years ago couldn't inspire Villa to kick off their season with a victory.\n\nGabriel Agbonlahor's seventh-minute goal gave Terry and company the perfect start at Villa Park.\n\nBut Hull, back in the Championship after last season's relegation, found their stride in the second half, deservedly equalising through 20-year-old Jarrod Bowen's first goal for the club.\n\nAndre Green should have put Villa back in front with 10 minutes remaining, but got his header all wrong from two yards out to leave Terry to settle for a point.\n\nBig-spending Wolves made a strong start to their promotion bid as Leo Bonatini's debut goal sealed a 1-0 win over Middlesbrough.\n\nBrazilian striker Bonatini, signed on a season-long loan from Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, punished a mistake from Boro defender Daniel Ayala to settle a tight encounter in the 33rd minute at Molineux.\n\nIt was an encouraging result for Wolves, who are among the leading contenders for promotion to the Premier League after a major close-season overhaul.\n\nFormer Porto midfielder Ruben Neves cost Wolves a Championship record \u00a315million and he impressed on his first appearance under new boss Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\nIt was a frustrating return to the second tier for Middlesbrough after last season's relegation.\n\nBobby Reid netted a brace and Famara Diedhiou scored on his first appearance as Bristol City beat Barnsley 3-1 at Ashton Gate.\n\nReid put the hosts ahead after 16 minutes before setting up Senegal striker Diedhiou, a club-record \u00a35.3 million signing from Angers, who headed home at the back post.\n\nReid then added his second of the day before Ryan Hedges pulled a goal back for Barnsley in stoppage-time.\n\nRocked by last week's 6-1 friendly thrashing at the hands of third tier Charlton, Ipswich restored their pride with a 1-0 victory over Birmingham at Portman Road.\n\nSuffering a hangover from last season's painful play-off final defeat against Huddersfield, Reading slumped to a 2-0 defeat at QPR.\n\nNorwich's Nelson Oliveira equalised two minutes from full-time to salvage a 1-1 draw at Fulham.\n\nDaniel Johnson's 79th minute penalty secured Preston's first opening-day win since 2008 as they beat Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 at Deepdale.\n\nSheffield United marked their return to the second tier after a six-year absence with a 1-0 victory over Brentford.\n\nDanish forward Kenneth Zohore struck in the 87th minute to give Cardiff a 1-0 victory at

In his place came the enigmatic Italian, a surprise choice to spearhead a new dawn at Molineux.\n\nAn exciting flood of players headed to the club from Europe, wooed by super-agent and Fosun associate, Jorge Mendes.\n\nIt went horribly wrong, Zenga was sacked, Paul Lambert was appointed to replace him, and Wolves subsequently finished in the Championship no man's land.\n\nAll that spending, promise and hopes of the fans, ultimately came to nothing.\n\nFast forward twelve-months and it has an all too familiar ring to it.\n\nEnigmatic former keeper Nuno Espirito Santo checks into Molineux amidst a blaze of Mendes influenced continental signings.\n\nWolves fans will be hoping that this is where the similarities end, thankfully, all the signs are that he is better equipped than Zenga ever was.\n\nThe former manager of Porto and Valencia has Champions League experience and a good managerial pedigree.\n\nHe was the first ever client of Mendes when he was a player and so far in pre-season they have worked together to bring in a number of familiar players to them both.\n\nNone more so than \u00a315m signing Ruben Neves from Porto, a player who captained the Portuguese giants at a very early age.\n\nFor Mendes and Santo to convince players like Neves, Roderick Miranda, Willy Bolly and Diogo Jota (pictured) to sign, is impressive.\n\nWolves have made big investments this summer and a huge emphasis has been placed on the defence with two keepers and six defenders coming in.\n\nNow Nuno needs to concentrate on a striker, and a good one at that.\n\nWithout a twenty goals a season striker, everything Wolves do will be in vain.\n\nWhether that man is Leo Bonatini, signed this week on a season-long loan, remains to be seen.\n\nThe 23-year-old Brazilian frontman scored 15 goals in 33 appearances last season, although that was in Saudi Arabia with Al-Hilal.\n\nAny football team is like a jigsaw, and on the surface it seems that Wolves now have a sensible approach to putting the pieces together.\n\nThe influx of loan signings arrive largely with the understanding that if promotion is achieved they will stay put.\n\nThat helps to allay the fears that some fans have that the club is merely a vehicle for processing the best of Portugal's young talents and sticking them in the shop window for Premier League suitors.\n\nRegardless of the financial gain that Wolves may achieve at some point from that approach, relying too heavily on this experiment could prove to be a treacherous path if not handled well.\n\nA vital continuity is needed at this football club now, there should be no recurrence of last season's shambolic and shabby behaviour.\n\nEverything now must be centered around stability, making this crop of players gel together to operate in the complex league that is The Championship.\n\nIt's not an easy league to pass your way out of, it's not an easy league to hoof your way out of, what you need is a good mix of the two.\n\nWolves need to settle quickly, and impress even quicker, that's the pressure of big spending.\n\nFosun and Mendes have a manager who believes in their project, that will prove vital going forward.\n\nRightly or wrongly, Paul Lambert didn't want any players in his dressing room that weren't approved by him.\n\nIt was that stubborn insistence that played a big part in the decision to sack him and go down a different route.\n\nA lot should be learned from Lambert though in his short time at the club.\n\nHe quickly won the respect of his players and spoke openly about what was needed to get out of this league - hard work.\n\nHe told how every successful dressing room he had ever worked in had one constant trait - players who will run through brick walls for each other.\n\nPre-season is a good time for Wolves to develop that mentality, as with the striker, if they don't succeed in this area they could be looking at a fruitless season again.\n\nOn paper, Wolves naturally still look disjointed and it will take some time for that to formulate into a team worthy of taking a pop at the automatic places.\n\nIf Santo can get the team there or there about at Christmas, I think Wolves will have a very strong second-half to the season.\n\nRome wasn't built in a day, Wolves will find that out in the first few weeks.\n\nWhat they do after that is what will determine how the season unfolds.\n\nThere is no real reason at all why they can't challenge at the peak of the division.\n\nWolves transfers: Sporting Lisbon winger unsure on future amid links to Wanderers\n\nSanto seems to be a very studious character and certainly has his head screwed on, after the debacle of last season, they are traits that will bode well for Wolves.\n\nExcited Wolves fans will be hoping that the board can sit back and let him get on with the task ahead, regardless of what the Championship throws at him.\n\nWolves can't keep telling people how they should be in the Premier League and that the stature of the club means it belongs there, they simply have to prove it.\n\nThis is the season the club has to get it right, financially the club has invested, another failure would surely see some interest lost by Fosun.\n\nFurther reading!", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "The things Wolverhampton Wanderers MUST do to get promotion", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-03", "id": "15034502", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3335669", "time": "06:32:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "id": "109", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "id": "184", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "id": "193", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "id": "153454", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302552"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "id": "303048", "location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304606"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305673"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305737"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Championship", "label": {"eng": "Football League Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306186"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_(sports)", "label": {"eng": "Loan (sports)"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306188"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Clube_de_Portugal", "label": {"eng": "Sporting Clube de Portugal"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "308527"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.C._Porto", "label": {"eng": "F.C.

goal sealed a 1-0 win over Middlesbrough on the opening weekend of the Championship on Saturday.\n\nBrazilian striker Bonatini, signed on a season-long loan from Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, punished a mistake from Boro defender Daniel Ayala to settle a tight encounter in the 33rd minute at Molineux.\n\nIt was an encouraging result for Wolves, who are among the leading contenders for promotion to the Premier League after a major close-season overhaul.\n\nFormer Porto midfielder Ruben Neves cost Wolves a Championship record \u00a315million and he impressed on his first appearance under new boss Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\nIt was a frustrating return to the second tier for Middlesbrough after last season's relegation and Garry Monk's side will have to improve significantly to live up to their billing as the bookmakers' favourites for promotion.\n\nBobby Reid netted a brace and Famara Diedhiou scored on his first appearance as Bristol City beat Barnsley 3-1 at Ashton Gate.\n\nReid put the hosts ahead after 16 minutes before setting up Senegal striker Diedhiou, a club-record \u00a35.3 million signing from Angers, who headed home at the back post.\n\nCity midfielder Reid then added his second of the day from close range on the half-hour mark as the Robins ran riot in the first period.\n\nRyan Hedges pulled a goal back for Barnsley in stoppage-time.\n\nRocked by last week's 6-1 friendly thrashing at the hands of third tier Charlton, Ipswich restored their pride with a 1-0 victory over Birmingham at Portman Road.\n\nJoe Garner was the Ipswich match-winner in the 47th minute, calmly converting from just outside the six-yard box.\n\nSuffering a hangover from last season's painful play-off final defeat against Huddersfield, Reading slumped to a 2-0 defeat at QPR.\n\nConor Washington headed in from close range on 22 minutes and slotted home a penalty 14 minutes into the second half after Reading's Tiago Ilori was sent off for a foul on Pawel Wszolek.\n\nNorwich's Nelson Oliveira equalised two minutes from full-time to salvage a 1-1 draw at Fulham.\n\nRussell Martin's own goal from Floyd Ayite's cross had put the hosts ahead on 25 minutes.\n\nBut substitute Oliveira beat the offside trap to earn the Canaries a point in new manager Daniel Farke's first game in charge.\n\nDaniel Johnson's 79th minute penalty secured Preston's first opening-day win since 2008 as they beat Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 at Deepdale.\n\nJohnson's spot-kick, awarded after Jordan Hugill was brought down by Tom Lees, ensured new Preston manager Alex Neil made a winning start after succeeding Simon Grayson.\n\nSheffield United marked their return to the second tier after a six-year absence with a 1-0 victory over Brentford.\n\nBlades skipper Billy Sharp headed the winner in the 39th minute at Bramall Lane.\n\nDanish forward Kenneth Zohore struck in the 87th minute to give Cardiff a 1-0 victory at Burton.", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate": false, "date":

Sitting on the bench, he watched and listened. And thought.\n\n\"A player never experiences the game from the side,\" he once said, finding the positives from his spot as a regular sub.\n\nHe remained a player but the coaching ball was rolling in his mind; he was intrigued by the decision making of players, he had a view in his mind of how the game should be played and he wanted to improve individuals.\n\nNow, he's the man tasked with improving Wolves from a 15th place finish last season to promotion contenders this time around.\n\nHelped, of course, by some bold and eye-catching transfer business.\n\nAt the start of June, Chelsea and Liverpool were, according to national reports, planning to \"make contact\" with Porto as they targeted midfielder Ruben Neves.\n\nAt the start of the following month, he signed for Wolves for more than \u00a315m. A club record fee. This, by the way, is a player who remains the youngest ever captain in the Champions League having skippered Porto aged just 18 years and 221 days back in 2015.\n\nSo have Wolves gone for quality over quantity in the window? Anything but. If anything, it seems they've tried for both.\n\nHere's a summary of their summer shopping and those who've shuffled out of the exit door.\n\nIncomings:\n\nGoalkeepers: John Ruddy (free, released by Norwich), Will Norris (undisclosed, Cambridge)\n\nDefenders: Ryan Bennett (free, released by Norwich), Roderick Miranda (\u00a32.5m, Rio Ave), Will Boly (loan, Porto), Phil Ofosu-Ayeh (free, released by Eintracht Braunschweig), Barry Douglas (\u00a31m, Konyaspor), Ruben Vinagre (loan, Monaco)\n\nMidfielders: Ruben Neves (\u00a315m, Porto)\n\nForwards: Diogo Jota (loan, Atletico Madrid), Leo Bonatini (loan, Al-Hilal)\n\nAnd outgoings:\n\nDefenders: Mike Williamson (released), Silvio (released), Dominic Iorfa (loan, Ipswich), Ethan Ebanks-Landell (loan, MK Dons)\n\nMidfielders: George Saville (undisclosed, Millwall), Jed Wallace (undisclosed, Millwall), James Henry (released), Lee Evans (loan, Wigan)\n\nForwards: Jon Dadi Bodvarsson (\u00a33m, Reading), Paul Gladon (loan, Heracles)\n\n'The target is promotion'\n\nThe sweeping changes have sparked optimism in the stands at Molineux. More than 16,000 season tickets have been sold - the highest for five years - and this Saturday's game against Boro will be the first home sell-out in three years.\n\nThe bookies are starting to wonder as well. Wolves were 18/1 to win the title six weeks ago but are down to 9/1 now.\n\nSo are they genuine contenders or will they flop? And, at risk of asking what appears the blatantly obvious, is promotion the target this season or is this a longer-term project?\n\n\"Nuno knows the target is promotion,\" says Tim Spiers, of the Express and Star.\n\n\"The owners have spent \u00a347m on transfer fees since taking charge - and that's not including wages and loan fees - and next year will be year three. There's a realisation that Wolves need to get into the Premier League as soon as possible.\"\n\nSo is Nuno the man to deliver?\n\n\"He was the only managerial target in the summer,\" explains Spiers.\n\n\"Obviously a few names were mentioned - Aitor Karanka being one of them - but the club was only interested in Nuno. If they didn't get him they would have kept Lambert.\n\n\"When he came in not many Wolves fans had heard of him to be honest but once they started doing their research they were impressed with what he'd achieved. He led Rio Ave into Europe for the first time in their history, finished fourth with Valencia and second with Porto as well as reaching the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\n\"It undoubtedly feels like a step-up from Walter Zenga last year.\n\n\"I think fans have been impressed so far. He's been very quick to introduce a new 3-4-3 system and he plays a patient, passing style.\n\n\"There needs to be patience, though. Wolves fans have been brought up on two out-and-out fast wingers who get balls into the box for a striker. If you look back, the previous bosses here who tried to implement a passing style of play - Glenn Hoddle and Stale Solbakken - didn't last very long.\n\n\"Wolves have spent four of the last 37 years in the top flight, which is nowhere near enough for a club of this size. But to succeed, managers need to be given longer than a few months to lay the foundations for success.\"\n\nAnd that's where the owners, Fosun, come in. When Nuno was appointed, he became the club's fourth boss in 10 months under the club's Chinese bosses.\n\nWhat's different this time around is Nuno is a client of super agent Jorge Mendes. In fact, he was the first ever client of the man who has gone on to become one of the most powerful figures in the game. And to think that when the pair first met, Mendes was running a video shop and a disco.\n\nWolves have denied Mendes is in charge of recruitment at Molineux but he is known to be a close associate of the owners.\n\nAll of the clubs Nuno has managed have been in someway linked with Mendes. When he was appointed at Wolves and asked about Mendes's influence, he replied: \"I am a client of the best agent in the world. I do my job; he does his job.\"\n\n'More substance to the signings'\n\nOn the pitch, scepticism has greeted some of the signings.\n\nSpeaking on 5Live this week, former Championship boss Chris Powell said: \"It's quite obvious what's happened with the Neves deal.\n\n\"It's to showcase him over here for Premier League sides or sides in Europe. There's no way in the world, with respect, that he would choose Wolves over Premier League sides or the top sides in Europe.\"\n\nThat, though, is no secret, says Wolves reporter Spiers.\n\n\"The players have been quite open on that. Neves did an interview in Portugal where he basically made it clear he was trying to put himself in the shop window. But fans don't seem to mind that to be honest. There seems to be more of an 'If you can't beat them, join them' approach and there's an acceptance that some of these players will go on to bigger and better things.\"\n\nSpiers added: \"There's definitely more substance to the signings this summer.\n\n\"Fosun sanctioned quite a lot of signings last year but they only took over six weeks or so before the start of the season so it was all a bit of a rush. Some of those players didn't work out, some have settled and we'll see the best of them this season.\n\n\"This year, though, a lot more planning has gone into it and the presence of Nuno has obviously helped attract players.\"\n\nSo will they gel?\n\n\"The quality is clear to see but there are still a lot of unknowns,\" said Spiers.\n\n\"At the minute, though, you'd say there are too many unknown quantities to make a definitive statement as to how Wolves will do. There's a new manager to consider, a new playing style, new faces. But there's definitely more optimism this year than there was last.\n\n\"The new signings and everything that's gone on this summer has given the fans real hope that this could be a memorable season.\"\n\nAfter such a hectic summer of incomings, Wolves appear just about done in the market. They brought in 23-year-old Brazilian forward Leo Bonatini from Saudi club Al Hilal this week but still want one more striker.\n\nThat they were linked with a \u00a320m move for Burnley's Andre Gray tells you all you need to know about their new-found riches, though that speculation was quickly rubbished by those in the know.\n\nThey're interested in signing Sam Gallagher on loan from Southampton but are pushing it if they want him in before Monk's side arrive at Molineux on Saturday.\n\n\"Gallagher scored 12 goals in a poor Blackburn team last year,\" said Spiers.\n\n\"If they can get someone in who can score 20 goals this season then they have a real chance.\n\n\"Everyone is looking forward to Boro now. There's a buzz here, an excitement. And there's a feel that the Boro game will tell us exactly how good Wolves are.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "World of Wolves: Record signings,

By Johnny Phillips\n\nLast Updated: 03/08/17 11:39am\n\nWolves have spent big in a bid to mount a Championship promotion challenge so can new boss Nuno Espirito Santo deliver? As part of a special Sky Sports documentary - Working with Wolves - to air on Friday, Johnny Phillips goes behind the scenes to find out about Molineux's \"big project\"...\n\n\"It's a different one,\" says the new head coach of Wolverhampton Wanderers when asked if this is the biggest challenge he has faced in his managerial career to date. There is plenty to measure the current job at Molineux against. Nuno Espirito Santo guided Portuguese side Rio Ave into Europe for the first time in the club's history. From there he moved to Valencia and led the Spanish club to Champions League qualification before returning to Portugal with another of Europe's giants Porto.\n\nChampionship guide 2017/18\n\npromotion, play-offs, relegation - all you need to know ahead of the new campaign...\n\n\"We are talking about a big project coming to Wolves,\" Nuno explains. \"So it is me and my technical staff trying to help make it big in the future and be able to fight for big things and achieve those things. I know I have come to a hard league. The Championship is a tough competition with good players and good managers. Everybody has the ambition. I'm just one more, trying to help my club and my fans.\"\n\nHe is an imposing figure - a former goalkeeper - and is discussing his hopes for the club during a break from his work in the manager's office, just across the corridor from the home dressing room where his players have just finished their final pre-season game at Molineux. Wolves defeated 2016 Premier League Champions Leicester City with a single goal from Portuguese winger Ivan Cavaleiro.\n\nIt is unwise to read too much into these pre-season run-outs, but Nuno's imprint was there. Deliberate build-up play, an emphasis on possession and quick attacking when the moment was right. Supporters, so often keen for a more direct approach at home, appeared ready to embrace the new era.\n\n\"We have to be patient and really persistent every day putting things together. It will take time. Most of all we must make the players believe that what we are doing can help them,\" the head coach adds.\n\nThe size of the job should not be underestimated. The Championship is packed with Premier League wannabes and Wolves have not gone down a conventional route in their attempts to win promotion. A few miles down the road in Birmingham, Harry Redknapp and Steve Bruce are relying more on experienced British players to do the job. At Wolves, alongside an entire management team unfamiliar to this division, they have brought in six Portuguese players over the last 12 months. The pick of them, Ruben Neves from Porto, cost \u00a315m, eclipsing the previous record spend of \u00a313m on Helder Costa.\n\nMuch of the transfer business is the work of super-agent Jorge Mendes, a business associate of the club's owners Fosun International, and it has put the club under a scrutiny they are not used to.\n\n\"If this wasn't an attractive proposition for a player than they wouldn't come here. Ultimately players have got a say in where they want to play their football and where they want to go, regardless of anyone's opinion on that,\" says managing director Laurie Dalrymple. \"Clearly Jorge Mendes is someone who works relatively closely with the owners, because he is a known associate and they have different business connections. So if he gives us some of that competitive advantage in terms of getting players across our desk, that we would do from any other agents anyway, then we are completely comfortable with that.\"\n\nThe chairman, Jeff Shi, has just moved over to the country after an unsatisfactory year travelling back and forth from Shanghai. He spends each morning at the training ground watching the players his company has invested heavily in.\n\n\"I talk with Nuno every day and I talk with the players sometimes, I want to know what they are doing,\" says Shi. \"The strategy for the club is that we are trying to find young, talented players from around the world. Also, we are trying to get a good academy to cultivate young local talent into the first team. A young and hungry talented team is what we want our identity to be.\"\n\nThe new arrivals have adapted well. During three days spent at the club, our cameras were given a close-up view of the management and first team squad at work. \"We are not used to being in the second league here but I think it is a great opportunity to get promotion. It's exciting, we all want to reach the Premier League,\" says Diogo Jota, a winger on loan from Atletico Madrid.\n\n\"It has been a good first few weeks working here because we all got to know each other quickly. When I arrived to do the medical exams I didn't realise how big the club was, I was very impressed with everything here and the stadium as well,\" adds Roderick Miranda. The central defender played for Nuno at Rio Ave and has taken his place in a back three in a revamped formation. \"He is a manager that likes a clean sheet. He loves to have the ball and control the game. He wants to put these ideas inside the club.\"\n\nAlongside Miranda is the affable Scouser Conor Coady. The former Liverpool man came to the club as a midfielder but has responded well to the demands of the new coaching staff as part of that three-man defence.\n\n\"I expect us to be more of a possession team and keep the ball moving, to buy into what the gaffer is teaching us,\" Coady says. \"It's learning how to do what the coaches want you to do. It's been up to us to get up to speed and get on with it. The new methods have been brilliant for the boys, they're really helping us. It's been a tough pre-season but one the boys have really enjoyed. \"\n\nFor Dave Edwards, who has spent almost a decade at Wolves, the changes have been the biggest he has known since making the move from Luton Town back in January 2008. \"It's been well received by the lads, the training ground has changed a lot. There has been a massive influx of players so hopefully we can all gel in time for the start of the season.\"\n\nWolves are taking a fresh and untried approach at this level. The outcome of the finished work next May will be hard to predict. So does the league season represents a blank canvas? \"We've started to spend a little bit more money than the past, even more than we did in the Premier League. I think there's a little bit more expectation and there is going to be a lot of pressure on the boys to perform,\" Edwards continues.\n\n\"Yeah, having a whole new blank canvas, with everything from last season gone out of the window in terms of style of play and the culture at the club, has meant it has been a whole rebuild. Everyone has got on board with it. The manager and the staff have been great. It's been different but I can really see what the manager is trying to introduce to the boys and his way of winning football matches.\"\n\nThe first league game of the season at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday is a sell-out among home support and it could see the club's highest attendance since 1981. There have been hopes and dreams under big spending owners here before, but nothing quite like this.

Reid scored twice and set up Diedhiou - a \u00a35.3m club-record signing from Angers in France - for a debut goal inside the opening half-hour.\n\nBarnsley managed a stoppage-time consolation through substitute Ryan Hedges, but utter humiliation was only prevented by the Tykes' Welsh goalkeeper Adam Davies.\n\nFulham 1-1 Norwich City\n\nNorwich substitute Nelson Oliveira equalised two minutes from time to salvage a 1-1 draw at Fulham in their opener at Craven Cottage.\n\nRussell Martin's own goal had put the hosts ahead on 25 minutes, and the cruel deflection from Floyd Ayite's cross looked set to secure victory for last season's beaten play-off semi-finalists.\n\nBut Oliveira beat the offside trap to earn the Canaries a point in new manager Daniel Farke's first game in charge.\n\nPreston North-End 1-0 Sheffield Wednesday\n\nPreston enjoyed their first opening-day win since 2008, as they beat Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 at Deepdale thanks to Daniel Johnson's late penalty\n\nJohnson's spot-kick came after Jordan Hugill was brought down by Tom Lees towards the end of a game that Preston dominated.\n\nIpswich Town 1-0 Birmingham City\n\nElsewhere, Ipswich got their campaign off to the ideal start with a 1-0 victory over Birmingham at Portman Road.\n\nThe only goal of the game came from Joe Garner in the 47th minute after he smartly tucked away a shot from just outside the six-yard box.\n\nBurton Albion 0-1 Cardiff City\n\nCardiff claimed a perfect start to the new campaign as Danish striker Kenneth Zohore grabbed a late winner at Burton Albion.\n\nThe big striker worked room for a shot on the edge of the box and on his left foot unerringly found the bottom corner of the net with a thunderous shot with just three minutes remaining.\n\nExperienced manager Neil Warnock, who managed Burton early in his career, had only lost once in his ten previous opening-day encounters and in truth they never really looked in danger of losing this one, Zohore's goal ending a spell of pressure for the Bluebirds.", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Championship round-up: Wins for Preston, QPR and Sheffield United, while

We proposed to him, improve, grow with a big team as we propose.\n\n\"Don't even think where you were before, think to where we are now.\n\n\"The reality is Saturday-Tuesday, Middlesbrough, Yeovil. This is the reality of all the players of Wolves, the past doesn't matter.\n\n\"Ruben joined us with all the ambition required for a big project like ours. He is doing okay.\n\n\"Players want to have new challenges in their lives. This is a new challenge for everybody. For those who were here, and those who came like me. Life is continually changing. This is what makes people better.\n\n\"I was not surprised by the arrival of Ruben or players like Diogo, I know them and I know they are going to help us.\"\n\nNuno is aware that rival Championship bosses think big spending clubs like Wolves are widening the gap between the haves and have nots\n\nHe added: \"What other managers think about us is their thoughts.\n\n\"We're trying to improve everyone, it doesn't matter if he cost \u00a310million, \u00a315milion, \u00a3200million. There is always space to do something better.\"\n\nNuno underlined the fact that Wolves' connections with Mendes are likely to be good, rather than bad, after last season's false start.\n\nThe Wolves boss said: \"I will always say that because you're talking about the best agent in the world.\n\n\"So he has the best players. So if us, Wolves, have a chance to get access to this profile of players, it's better for us.\n\n\"But that doesn't say we are not open and alert to all the situations in the market. Regardless of who is the agent. It is all about the player, what he can give us as a team.\"\n\nNuno maintains however that Wolves' recruitment policy is not governed by one man.\n\nHe added: \"You put on a sheet all the names you want. You start putting profiles together, who fits and who is best for the club.\n\n\"The club decides.\n\n\"It's about the manager, the sports director, the chairman, the general manager.

star's new side were held to a 1-1 draw by Hull on the opening weekend of the Championship season.\n\nAfter winning 15 major honours in 22 years with Chelsea, Terry is making a fresh start with Villa following his release by the Premier League champions at the end of last season.\n\nTerry's switch to Steve Bruce's side has made them among the favourites for promotion from the second tier.\n\nBut the former England defender's first Championship appearance since a loan spell with Nottingham Forest 17 years ago couldn't inspire Villa to kick off their season with a victory.\n\nGabriel Agbonlahor's seventh-minute goal gave Terry and company the perfect start at Villa Park.\n\nBut Hull, back in the Championship after last season's relegation, found their stride in the second half, deservedly equalising through 20-year-old Jarrod Bowen's first goal for the club.\n\nAndre Green should have put Villa back in front with 10 minutes remaining, but got his header all wrong from two yards out to leave Terry to settle for a point.\n\nBig-spending Wolves made a strong start to their promotion bid as Leo Bonatini's debut goal sealed a 1-0 win over Middlesbrough.\n\nBrazilian striker Bonatini, signed on a season-long loan from Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, punished a mistake from Boro defender Daniel Ayala to settle a tight encounter in the 33rd minute at Molineux.\n\nIt was an encouraging result for Wolves, who are among the leading contenders for promotion to the Premier League after a major close-season overhaul.\n\nFormer Porto midfielder Ruben Neves cost Wolves a Championship record \u00a315million and he impressed on his first appearance under new boss Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\nIt was a frustrating return to the second tier for Middlesbrough after last season's relegation.\n\nBobby Reid netted a brace and Famara Diedhiou scored on his first appearance as Bristol City beat Barnsley 3-1 at Ashton Gate.\n\nReid put the hosts ahead after 16 minutes before setting up Senegal striker Diedhiou, a club-record \u00a35.3 million signing from Angers, who headed home at the back post.\n\nReid then added his second of the day before Ryan Hedges pulled a goal back for Barnsley in stoppage-time.\n\nRocked by last week's 6-1 friendly thrashing at the hands of third tier Charlton, Ipswich restored their pride with a 1-0 victory over Birmingham at Portman Road.\n\nSuffering a hangover from last season's painful play-off final defeat against Huddersfield, Reading slumped to a 2-0 defeat at QPR.\n\nNorwich's Nelson Oliveira equalised two minutes from full-time to salvage a 1-1 draw at Fulham.\n\nDaniel Johnson's 79th minute penalty secured Preston's first opening-day win since 2008 as they beat Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 at Deepdale.\n\nSheffield United marked their return to the second tier after a six-year absence with a 1-0 victory over Brentford.\n\nDanish forward Kenneth Zohore struck in the 87th minute to give Cardiff a 1-0 victory at Burton.", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Terry frustrated as Hull hold Villa - World Soccer Talk", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-05", "id": "15593975",

Looking forward to the return of the Football League calendar?\n\nHere are five things you need to look out for ahead of Saturday's 3pm kick off, in front of a packed out Molineux.\n\nSell-out crowd\n\nWolves are set for a sell-out crowd at Molineux for the first time in three years.\n\nWanderers take on relegation sufferers Boro in a game which could see the club's highest attendance since 1981.\n\nMolineux's biggest crowd to date came in an FA Cup match against Boro in 1981. The game saw Wolves progress after a 3-1 win in front of 40,524 fans.\n\nThe match is the first 'sold out' game since 29,829 fans watched their team win the League One title back in 2014 with a 3-0 win against Carlisle.\n\nSince Molineux's redevelopment in 2012, the highest league attendance has been 30,110, with 30,193 attending last year's loss to Chelsea in the FA Cup.\n\nThe official capacity at Molineux is 31,700, so will Wanderers fans set a record crowd on Saturday?\n\nWe'll be sure to find out!\n\nTeam news\n\nHelder Costa underwent ankle surgery earlier in the month and will miss the start of the Championship season. Wolves' 2016/17 Player of the Year only joined the club permanently for a then record transfer fee in January.\n\nBen Marshall flew home early from Wolves' tour of Austria after he sustained a hip injury. He's a doubt for the game having not played since.\n\nSummer signing Phil Ofosu-Ayeh will miss the game, too. The right back arrived from Eintracht Braunschweig with the injury and is thought to be out until the end of August.\n\nIvan Cavaleiro is suspended. The winger was shown a straight red in a 3-1 defeat to Derby at the back end of last season.\n\nDebutants\n\nA busy transfer window could mean numerous Championship debutants for Wolves in the season opener.\n\nBrazilian front man Leo Bonatini has signed on loan - the latest through the door.\n\nThe ex Al-Hilal Riyadh forward scored 15 goals in 36 appearances last season; Bonatini is a welcome addition to Wolves' front line and could feature on Saturday.\n\nRuben Neves is set to make his Championship debut. The Portuguese defensive midfielder arrived for record \u00a315.8m in the summer from FC Porto, penning a five-year deal.\n\nLoanee Diogo Jota also impressed in Wolves' victory over Leicester. The pacy winger could prove invaluable for Wolves with Costa's injury and Cavaleiro's suspension.\n\nRyan Bennett, John Ruddy and Roderick Miranda could also start.\n\nIkeme tribute and Cure Leukaemia charity\n\nWolves have announced that 10% of all gate receipts will be donated to Cure Leukaemia.\n\nThe gesture comes after goalkeeper Carl Ikeme was diagnosed with acute leukaemia last month.\n\nIkeme has been assigned the number one shirt by the club for the coming season and is currently undergoing treatment.\n\nCure Leukaemia will also be doing a bucket collection at the game, whilst fans can show their support for Ikeme by signing a 'get well' card in Wolfie's Den.\n\nJames McLaughlin, chief executive of Cure Leukaemia, has confirmed the money raised from the game will go towards increasing the capacity at the Centre for Clinical Haematology at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital.\n\nWolves have confirmed that many fans are arranging events for the day in support of the popular Ikeme. The club will do what it can to support these plans.\n\nNew management\n\nThe match will also be the first league game in charge for new boss Nuno Espirito Santo. The former Valencia and Porto manager came in to replace Paul Lambert.\n\nSanto won the Champions League in 2004 under the management of an up and coming Jose Murinho.

The spending has not stopped there for either side, while each also has a new young manager in place aiming to prove certain points.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo, the former Porto and Valenica head coach, wants to show why he has swapped the Champions League for the Championship, and step out from the shadow of Jorge Mendes.\n\nMiddlesbrough travel to Wolves with \u00a315million Britt Assombalonga set to play up front\n\nGarry Monk has the opportunity to demonstrate the reasons for his departure from Leeds, having been backed strongly by Steve Gibson and finally afforded what appears a stable working environment.\n\nBoth clubs are expected to mount sustained challenges to reach the Premier League so it is fascinating to see how they start off. It is a finely poised contest, devilishly difficult to pick a winner. Molinuex will be a 31,000 sell-out, expected to be the biggest crowd since 1981. That is due to the money being lavished on new recruits - 11 in all - and the quiet confidence that has built up under Santo.\n\nThe Portuguese 43-year-old has shaped Wolves into a new 3-4-3 formation, in siting upon high ball retention and defensive solidity. There have been two defeats in pre-season but four wins and three clean sheets, including the 1-0 win over Leicester last weekend that saw the former Premier League champions well beaten.\n\n'I'm happy. Since day one we brought some things that are new to them but at the same time we truly believed they were capable,' said Santo. 'Our last game of pre-season showed we are in the right way. 'It is a new philosophy. If you want to control the game through possession, we have to work harder on moving the ball around, creating mobility, creating lines of passes. At the same time be organised in defence, be able to control the chances.\n\n'There is still a long way to go. It is never a finished product. The team will always grow. One thing is very important, when you see the players believing it is a moment of real pleasure. This will guide us to the success we expect.'\n\nAs well as bringing Neves from Porto, Wolves have signed Diogo Jota on loan from Atletico Madrid along with others from the continent. John Ruddy and Ryan Bennett have arrived from Norwich to provide Championship know-how, while Ivan Cavaleiro, last summer's \u00a37m signing from Monaco, and Helder Costa, the \u00a313m recruit from Monaco, are a year more attuned to English football. All together, it appears some side and if the star players can reach their finest form a proper promotion push is inevitable. Santo also wants to utilise the support of the fans who have flocked back. 'The strength of the wolf is the pack, we want Molinuex to be the pack,' he said.\n\nWest Midlands hosts Wolves will boast \u00a315.8m Ruben Neves in midfield in front of 31,000\n\nIt has been five years since Wolves were relegated from the Premier League and they have even dipped into the third tier, but now feels a genuine chance for a reunion with the top-flight.\n\nBoro are hoping to bounce back at the first opportunity. Monk has spent nearly \u00a345m this summer with Assombalonga joined by other major signings in Martin Braithwaite, Jonny Howson, Ashley Fletcher, Darren Randolph, and Cyrus Christie. These are acquisitions ready to go in the Championship, a strong collection of players in their prime and giving Monk no excuses.\n\nAt Leeds, the 38-year-old Englishman worked miracles by getting the team to challenge for the play-offs before falling away at the end. He walked away knowing better conditions could be found on Teesside and Gibson has lived up to his word, even keeping hold of his sought-after nephew Ben despite a bid worth above \u00a320m being made by West Bromwich Albion. The pressure is now on to translate cash into points.\n\nMonk is aware of the difficultly of his first fixture. 'This game is very unpredictable,' he said. 'Wolves have recruited high-calibre players and are dangerous. But we have to focus on ourselves, and we want a good start.\n\n'Winning games improves confidence, it's not rocket science. Our season won't be defined by this game but we want to focus on getting the maximum we can from it.\n\n'It's the most difficult league in the world.

The arrival of Fosun as owners last year has resulted in unprecedented investment in the playing staff, bringing in players the likes of which nobody could have anticipated at this level, and soon we will start finding out if all that optimism is justified.\n\nThey could have had an easier start to the season. Middlesbrough have used their Premier League parachute money to invest to try to get an instant return to the top flight and many tipsters have them as favourites to win the division. Garry Monk looks a good recruit as manager and new signings like Assombalonga, Dutch striker Braithwaite, former Man Utd youngster Ashley Fletcher, midfielder Jonny Howson and keeper Darren Randolph all look useful signings, and defender Ben Gibson remains with the club despite being a target for many Premier League clubs.\n\nBut Wolves have set their stall out to be competing with Boro and the likes of Villa, Fulham and Sheffield Wednesday at the top end of the table. And they have been doing some serious strengthening in the transfer market too. The \u00a315m signing of Neves caught everyone's attention and the pre season friendlies have given the impression he won't disappoint. And loan signings Jota and Boly look of a similar quality. Centre back Miranda and left wing back Barry Douglas also look like successful signings and the most recent signing, Brazilian striker Bonatini is more of an unknown quantity. All those additions represent a significant improvement on last season's squad, and the fact the club have held on to Helder Costa who looked worth every inch of the \u00a313m paid for him last season is another massive boost.\n\nCosta along with Marshall who impressed last season are on the injury list at the moment and Cavaleiro is suspended as a consequence of a sending off late last season. But there will still be a strong enough squad to choose from for manager Nuno. A 343 formation has been used throughout pre season and that's surely what we will see on Saturday.

Two bosses are Portuguese, one Dutch, one German, one Spanish, one Russian and one Serbian. The millionaire's playground of the Premier League of non-British managers have plenty too.\n\nWhen Carlos Carvalhal was named Sheffield Wednesday's first foreign manager in their 149-year history back in June 2015, few people had heard of him in England.\n\nBut Carvalhal has woken the giant and impressively guided the Owls to the play-offs two years in a row.\n\nHis compatriot Nuno Espirito Santo has joined him in the second-tier, taking the number of Portuguese coaches currently working in the top two divisions of English football up to four. Jose Mourinho and Marco Silva will lead Manchester United and Watford respectively into battle in the Premier League this season.\n\nFor Carvalhal, Mourinho's success domestically and in Europe has inspired his fellow countrymen.\n\n\"Jose opened all the doors to Portuguese managers,\" Carvalhal told The Star. \"What he has done in his career is fantastic. He is a very clever man and given inspiration to everyone. He opened the doors to the other coaches in the world but especially at the highest level in English football.\n\n\"At the same time, there are other Portuguese coaches who have done fantastic work in other parts of the world. Manuel Jos\u00e9 did some amazing work at Al Ahly and Carlos Queiroz has done a great job with the Iran national team.\n\n\"We also have a lot of coaches in Vietnam and Africa and in Europe Leonardo Jardim is doing great things with Monaco so we have a lot of coaches doing very well.\n\n\"I think it is natural for the Portuguese coaches to jump to the highest level. It is a natural consequence of the success they have had in different countries. It is why Marco is with Watford and Nuno at Wolves.\n\n\"We are very well prepared on the technical and tactical side. But most importantly, we create an emotional environment around us. Football is a group of players who are trying to beat each other so the emotional connection is very important.\"\n\nCarvalhal has some sympathy for British coaches over their lack of opportunities to manage, particularly in the top-flight. Is he surprised more don't try their luck on the continent?\n\n\"England is a very strong country in a lot of areas so the managers don't need to go abroad too much,\" he said. \"People are successful in this society.\n\n\"It is completely different in Portugal. A lot of people have had to go abroad in the last few years to try to find a better life.\n\n\"Some of our best architects, engineers and football coaches have gone abroad over the last few years.\n\n\"In England, the managers are very good but there will probably come a time when they need to go find work in another country.\n\n\"So far English coaches don't need to go abroad but I think in the future they will need to and show their abilities in other countries.\"\n\nThe 51-year-old is looking forward to crossing paths again with Nuno, who will take charge of his first Wolves match on Saturday when they entertain much-fancied Middlesbrough.\n\nCarvalhal said: \"I have met him once or twice when we have done some TV work together but he's not someone I know really well.\n\n\"Championship matches are on all the time in Portugal. When I arrived at Sheffield Wednesday, I watched all the games from the previous season and I learned as much as I could about the competition and I'm sure he will have done the same.\"\n\nThe second-tier is awash with cash and Wolves have been busy in the transfer market, spending a small fortune on strengthening their first-team squad this summer.\n\nIt was just over a month ago Wanderers forked out a Championship record fee of around \u00a315m to land midfielder Ruben Neves from Portuguese giants FC Porto. So far Wolves have purchased 11 players.\n\n\"He (Nuno) knows what he must do and he has brought in players who I think will play in the Champions League in the future,\" claimed Carvalhal.\n\n\"Ruben is a midfielder that I expect will one day play in the Premier League and they have signed a very strong centre-half in Willy Boly from Porto.\n\n\"They have brought winger Diogo Jota in on a season-long loan from Atletico Madrid and he was in the Porto's starting eleven last season!\n\n\"For me, Wolves will be one of the candidates for the top positions. I'm absolutely sure of that.\"\n\nWolves are not alone in paying big transfer fees and huge salaries on players. Relegated Boro are thought to have spent more than \u00a330m on new additions while Aston Villa have added serious Premier League pedigree in the likes of John Terry and Glenn Whelan.\n\nUnder pressure Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy has condemned the \"outrageous\" summer spending.\n\n\"I am not complaining but I just do not know how it can be sustained,\" he said. \"I think it is outrageous - but don't get me wrong if I had it, I would spend it.\n\n\"I get Middlesbrough signing their players because of the parachute payments. Bristol City spent \u00a35m on a striker [Famara Diedhiou] and Wolves spent \u00a315m on a holding midfield player for heaven's sake - they already have a \u00a313m winger [Helder Costa, signed in January].\"\n\nDespite some of the \"crazy deals\" Wednesday's rivals have undertaken, Carvalhal remains optimistic his Owls side will be a major force in the division once again.\n\n\"It gets more difficult every year to get promotion but we will try to get into the first positions,\" he said. \"There will be eight other teams who will be looking to achieve the same thing.", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-03", "title": "Sheffield Wednesday: Carlos Carvalhal on Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho and English football's Portuguese invasion", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-03", "id": "15222717", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2015-06-", "textStart": 434, "amb": false, "textEnd": 443}], "storyUri": "eng-3335669", "time": "22:09:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "id": "76", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "id": "138", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "id": "166", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "id": "184", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "id": "96751", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Porto"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "id": "242110", "location": {"label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302552"}, {"score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "id": "303048", "location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "id": "303539", "location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304433"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}, "type": "org", "id": "304435"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C."}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304436"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304606"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305737"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Championship", "label": {"eng": "Football League Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306186"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306197"}, {"score": 1, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306277"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation", "label": {"eng": "Promotion and relegation"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306288"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.C._Porto", "label": {"eng": "F.C.

Leo Bonatini made an instant impact as his debut goal earned Wolves a 1-0 Sky Bet Championship win against Middlesbrough\n\nBonatini, who has joined Wolves on a season-long loan from the Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, pounced on a 33rd-minute mistake in the Middlesbrough defence.\n\nThe goal also ensured that it was the perfect start for new Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo in front of sold-out Molineux.\n\nBut it was not the beginning to his reign that new Middlesbrough chief Garry Monk had been seeking after his expensive outlay on new players.\n\nWith 13 debutants on show - seven from Wolves and six from Middlesbrough - it was perhaps not surprising that the opening stages of the game saw the two new-look teams struggle to create any real chances of note.\n\nAdam Clayton's 14th-minute free-kick, after George Friend had been fouled by Wolves right-back Matt Doherty, did cause concern in the hosts penalty area until it was steered behind for a corner by Bonatini.\n\nWhile Middlesbrough toiled for an opening, Wolves were equally short of success in front of goal.\n\nBonatini did do well to tee-up \u00a315m club record signing Ruben Neves on the edge of the area in the 19th minute.\n\nBut the Portugal international midfielder, who joined Wolves from Porto, was unable to get any power on his shot and it was comfortably cleared by the Middlesbrough backline.\n\nIt looked like it would need something inspired or a mistake to end the stalemate and unfortunately for Middlesbrough it was a howler from Daniel Ayala that let in Bonatini to break the deadlock and finally spark the game into life.\n\nA misplaced pass by Ayala was intercepted by Bonatini and he strode into the penalty area before rolling the ball past the stranded Middlesbrough goalkeeper Darren Randolph.\n\nBut Wolves advantage should really have been short-lived as Martin Braithwaite squandered a golden opportunity to equalise two minutes before the interval.\n\nCyrus Christie delivered an excellent right-wing cross that picked out Braithwaite only for the Danish forward to lift his header well wide after coming under pressure from goalkeeper John Ruddy.\n\nHaving wasted that opening, Middlesbrough were fortunate not to fall further behind six minutes after the restart when only the outstretched hand of Randolph prevented Bright Enobakhare from doubling Wolves advantage after a powerful run into the penalty area.\n\nConverting that chance would have eased Wolves nerves as Middlesbrough looked for a way back on to level terms.\n\nThey would have found an equaliser in the 72nd minute had it not been for Ruddy.\n\nMiddlesbrough's \u00a315m striker Britt Assombalonga was set-up by Patrick Bamford only for Ruddy to spread his body to beat away the close range shot.",

He finished coolly on his debut as a 17-year-old to become Porto's youngest league scorer. He surpassed Cristiano Ronaldo as the youngest Portuguese player to appear in the Champions League. At 18 he became the youngest captain in the history of the same competition, leading Porto to victory over Maccabi Tel Aviv. On Saturday he looks likely to anchor the midfield for Wolves as they host Middlesbrough in the Championship.\n\nThe \u00a315.8m Wolves paid to bring Neves to the Black Country is another record, the biggest transfer fee in the history of the Championship. And since the deal was agreed it has raised questions: about the club's ambitions under the Chinese owners Fosun (owners closely advised by Neves's agent, Jorge Mendes), the competitive status of the division and what the transfer says about Neves's own ability.\n\nIn his three seasons as a professional, Neves has managed to squeeze in not only a rapid rise but a stark decline. A local boy who had been on Porto's books since the age of eight, Neves was plucked out of the youth system by the then manager Julen Lopetegui, now Spain's national coach. It is easy to understand why.\n\nAn instinctive reader of the game, Neves's key strength is his ability to make interceptions, backed up with a strong tackle. In his breakthrough season, over-the-top comparisons flew thick and fast but one, describing him as \"the new Sergio Busquets\", carried more weight as it came from his team-mate Cristian Tello, himself a product of Barcelona's La Masia academy.\n\nNeves has more than that in his locker though. Technically adept he can not only break up play but drive it back down the other end of the pitch. He can pick out a crossfield pass from either flank. He takes up smart positions in and around the box that make him a great option for long range shooting opportunities.\n\nBut Neves has scored only twice since that goal on his debut. The two full caps he earned as an 18-year-old (in friendlies against Russia and Luxembourg) have not been followed up, and his chances to shine at junior level have been and gone. He made only six starts in the league last year, a season whose tone was set when Neves burst into tears on the Porto bench after his coach had decided not to use him during a Champions League qualifier with Roma. That coach was Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, now the manager of Wolves.\n\nNuno himself has had an itinerant career (he lasted only a season at Porto) and is perhaps most famous for being the first client signed to the books of Mendes. The world's most powerful agent, Mendes is a business associate of the Fosun Group and is believed to have advised it to plump for Wolves when the company was first looking to invest in football to support the Chinese government's latter-day enthusiasm for the game.\n\nMendes, through his company Gestifute, represents Neves and four other players on Wolves' books. Between them they have cost the club about \u00a332m in transfer fees. There are questions as to whether Mendes is directing undue influence over the transfer policy at Wolves and to whether these players, half of whom were part of the side that finished 15th in the Championship last season, are the right ones to get Wolves to the Premier League.\n\nNeves is the biggest question mark of all. He has the raw ability, but does he have the mentality to thrive in the unrelenting and highly physical environment of the Championship? Is his game even suited to a league where less financially endowed clubs will see no shame in bypassing midfield altogether? Wolves' pre-season results have been mixed but they will be buoyed by a convincing win over Leicester City last weekend. Neves, sitting in a midfield two as part of a 3-4-3 formation, pulled the strings.\n\nThe long-term motivation behind Neves's arrival in the Midlands seems clear. He is here to earn a move to a Premier League club. In his precocious years Liverpool and Chelsea were matched against his name and it is surely clubs of that marque Neves and his advisers still have in mind. Neither is the 20-year-old shy of admitting it. In an interview with Wolverhampton's Express and Star to commemorate his arrival, Neves was asked if he saw this move as a chance to put himself in the shop window. \"Yes,\" he replied. \"It will be easier to move to the Premier League from here. I'm focused on getting better as a player and this is the right place to do so.\"\n\nTime will tell whether he is right. But Neves's arrival in England's second tier is not the only sign that the Championship is changing. The takeover of Leeds by TV sports rights magnate Andrea Radrizzani. The arrivals of Leonid Slutsky at Hull and the Borussia Dortmund II's backroom staff at Norwich. A transfer window that has seen over \u00a3130m spent with a month still to run. The Championship is not England's second tier any more, it is the gateway to the Premier League. Expect more players like Neves to be persuaded of that fact.", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "Is Wolves' record signing R\u00faben Neves really suited to the Championship?", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-04", "id": "15371652", "extractedDates": null, "storyUri": "eng-3335669", "time": "13:52:00", "details": {}, "concepts": [{"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "id": "67", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luxembourg"}, "id": "134", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Luxembourg"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "id": "184", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "id": "191", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton"}, "id": "82107", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "id": "86727", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "302552"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "type": "org", "id": "304434"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "304606"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}, "type": "person", "id": "305102"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305217"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305673"}, {"score": 3, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}, "type": "org", "id": "305679"}, {"score": 4, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305737"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Championship", "label": {"eng": "Football League Championship"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "306186"}, {"score": 2, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}, "type": "wiki", "id": "307958"}, {"score": 5, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.C._Porto", "label": {"eng": "F.C.

Australia internationals Bailey Wright, Massimo Luongo and Jackson Irvine all played full games in the Championship.\n\nTerry led the hosts out at Villa Park representing a club other than Chelsea for the first time since a loan stint at Nottingham Forest ended in May 2000.\n\nHis one-time England colleague Gabriel Agbonlahor gave Steve Bruce's men the lead when he swept home Alan Hutton's low cross but Villa were unable to gain any further reward for their early dominance and were punished when Jarrod Bowen volleyed in a first Tigers goal after the hour.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers struck an opening-day blow against a prospective promotion rival by beating Middlesbrough 1-0 at Molineux.\n\nWolves named highly-touted midfielder Ruben Neves - the most expensive player in Championship history - in their starting line-up against Middlesbrough, who are seeking an instant return to the Premier League.\n\nHowever, another debutant sealed the points for Nuno's side when Leo Bonatini capitalised upon a sloppy 33rd-minute backpass from Daniel Ayala.\n\nBristol City were the opening day's big winners thanks to destructive 3-1 victory over Barnsley, Bobby Reid grabbing a first-half brace.\n\nFamara Diedhiou, a record signing from Angers, was also on target, with Australia defender Bailey Wright playing a full game as captain for the winning side.\n\nReading suffered penalty heartache against Huddersfield Town at Wembley in May and Queens Park Rangers caught them off guard, chalking up a 2-0 triumph at Loftus Road with Socceroos midfielder Massimo Luongo playing a full game for QPR.\n\nConor Washington scored a goal in each half for the hosts, the latter from the penalty spot after Royals defender Tiago Ilori was sent off for fouling Pawel Wszolek.\n\nHarry Redknapp's Birmingham City were beaten 1-0 at Ipswich Town, while Cardiff City triumphed by the same margin at Burton Albion - Wright and Luongo's international team-mate Jackson Irvine also playing a full game.\n\nThere was better news for another South Yorkshire side as Sheffield United marked their return to the second tier with a 1-0 win over Brentford - local hero Billy Sharp bringing Bramall Lane to its feet six minutes before the interval.\n\nUnited's city rivals Sheffield Wednesday made a false start in 2017-2018, having reached the play-offs in each of the past two seasons.\n\nDaniel Johnson converted a 79th-minute penalty to give Preston North End a 1-0 win at Deepdale after Owls defender Tom Lees brought down Jordan Hugill in the box.\n\nFulham were Reading's semi-final victims in the post-season and appeared to be on their way to victory after Norwich City's Russell Martin put through his own goal, but Nelson Oliveira equalised in the dying minutes.", "eventUri":

To Fosun, the $60 million asking price set by Wolves's owner, Steve Morgan, was a drop in the ocean. Money for the transfer market was not a problem. Nor, Kenyon said, was attracting the players who could transform the club.\n\nFosun's trump card was the close relationship it had established -- built over many years, but cemented at the Shanghai launching of their partnership in January 2016 -- with the one man in soccer everybody wants to know. Fosun could provide Wolves with funds, but it could also bring the club the help of the world's pre-eminent agent: Jorge Mendes.\n\nDiogo Jota had them with his first touch. A few minutes into Wolverhampton's match against Leicester City last Saturday -- its last warm-up game before the Championship's regular season gets underway this weekend -- Jota found himself on the edge of his own box, facing the Leicester wing Marc Albrighton.\n\nHe paused for a moment, feinted right, then slipped away to the left, leaving Albrighton grasping at his ghost. A murmur of appreciation rippled through the near-12,000-strong crowd at Molineux, Wolves's atmospheric, patchwork home. \"Well, he has played for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid,\" one fan muttered approvingly.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, the air at Molineux crackles with anticipation. There is, Coady said, an \"optimism\" here, one that has been detected \"by the players just as much as the people in the stands.\"\n\nThat is not just because of Jota, a 20-year-old Portuguese winger who had played in the 2016-17 Champions League for F.C. Porto. There is his countryman R\u00faben Neves, too, once the shining star of Porto's academy and the youngest player to captain a team in the Champions League. Wolves has signed two more Portuguese this summer, Roderick Miranda and Ruben Vinagre, adding them to a squad that already included Helder Costa and Ivan Cavaleiro.\n\nAnother Porto alumnus, the French defender Willy Boly, has arrived, too, and one more will coach them: Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo spent last year at the Portuguese club after a spell with Valencia, having led both in the Champions League.\n\nFosun's money pays their salaries, of course; it is the lure of England, the prospect of the Premier League, that drew them here. \"I wanted to play here,\" Jota said in one of Molineux's dressing rooms last weekend. \"Everyone dreams of England, and the Premier League.\"\n\nBut it is Mendes, 51, who has made it all possible, who delivered Neves, Jota and, of course, Esp\u00edrito Santo, the first client he ever had, long before he was the superagent responsible for the careers of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.\n\nWolves has never hidden the fact that Mendes is a \"known associate\" of Fosun, in the words of the managing director Laurie Dalrymple, though the club has strenuously denied that he is overseeing its transfer policy. Wolves's squad this year, club executives noted, will include a number of new additions not looked after by Mendes's agency, Gestifute.\n\nThe Football League, too, decided in December that Mendes's role was no cause for concern, despite rules dictating that agents cannot have a controlling influence on clubs. Although a subsidiary of Fosun owns a slice of Gestifute's holding company, the Football League determined there was no conflict of interest. (Mendes and Gestifute did not respond to several requests to discuss their plans for Wolves for this article.)\n\nWhat is irrefutable, however, is that Wolves is now part of what Pippo Russo, an Italian sociology professor and the author of a book about the superagent's influence, calls the \"Mendes system.\" It is a network of clubs -- some large, some small, some in the shadows and some in the brightest of lights -- across Europe, all of which, formally or informally, turn to Mendes for advice, for help and for players.\n\nThat network has turned Mendes into, at least in Russo's estimation, \"the most powerful man in football,\" not simply someone who \"works in the market, but someone who creates the market.\"\n\nMendes is not the only agent to have become a first port of call for many clubs, but none of his peers and rivals can match his reach, or his influence. Most of his hundreds of clients pass through or end up at one, or more, of these clubs at some point. Sometimes, they stay only briefly; sometimes, they move on to another.\n\nThe market never stops turning. And with every turn, Mendes and Gestifute earn another fee, another commission.\n\nFew in soccer would dispute Russo's description of Mendes as the most powerful player representative in the sport. Alex Ferguson, doubtless thankful for Mendes's work in delivering Ronaldo to Manchester United, described him as \"the best agent I dealt with, without a doubt.\"\n\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Gil, the chief executive of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, told Miguel Cuesta, the author of \"The Mendes Key,\" a book outlining the agent's methods, that Mendes \"sets up his chessboard to move pieces to different clubs.\"\n\n\"He is loyal to everyone,\" Gil added, \"and he does not play tricks on you.\"\n\nIn fact, Mendes has a reputation -- unlike many of his peers -- for not chasing the quickest deal, but for encouraging his players to wait for the right moment to make a move. His first question to every prospective client is, \"Where do you want to play?\" In at least some cases, he presents his players with blueprints for their careers: Follow this path, he tells them, and you will get where you want to go.\n\nIt is an approach that has made his players -- Ronaldo, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, Radamel Falcao and the rest -- famous, and earned him not only a litany of plaudits but also considerable wealth, enough to make him the second-highest-earning sports agent in the world, after baseball's Scott Boras.\n\nBut his success has been built not only on his sage advice. The Mendes network is central to it.\n\nThe beating heart is, of course, in his native Portugal. According to a 2011 brochure produced by Quality Sports Investment, a fund designed to buy the economic rights to players whom both Kenyon and Mendes advised, Mendes claimed he oversaw 68 percent of all transfer activity from the country's three giant clubs -- Benfica and Sporting in Lisbon, as well as F.C. Porto -- between 2001 and 2010.\n\nThat is just the start, however. There is also a long list of smaller clubs where, according to Russo, Mendes places players from South America when they first arrive in Europe. These are the moves that provide his young clients with opportunities to play and that have, at times, helped him circumvent FIFA rules on outside investors' -- so-called third parties -- owning the economic rights of players.\n\nThere are so many of these clubs that, when Portugal's tax and customs authorities announced an investigation into Mendes's transfer activity over the last three years, their list ran to 13 teams.\n\n\"Working with Mendes gives clubs like ours access to better players than we might otherwise be able to have,\" said Ant\u00f3nio Silva Campos, the president of Rio Ave, a first-division club that Russo calls F.C. Mendes, but one that is not part of that tax investigation. \"There is no club in Portugal who does not want to work with him.\"\n\nEderson, Manchester City's new Brazilian goalkeeper, is a case in point: He spent time at Rio Ave before joining Benfica. Gestifute, Silva Campos confirmed, had owned 20 percent of his economic rights.\n\nThere are also, according to Russo, the clubs that Mendes uses as \"points of passage\" for his players: teams like Besiktas, Dynamo Moscow, Valencia, Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and, formerly, Monaco.\n\n\"Sometimes the players do not play for them, they just go out on loan,\" Russo said. Jota, for example, is under contract to Atl\u00e9tico, but played on loan at Porto last season and now will do the same at Wolverhampton.\n\nFor others, these clubs are mere way stations on their way to bigger, brighter things.\n\n\"The clubs benefit because the players bring them closer to the elite, and then they can resell them for more money,\" Russo said. He cited Andr\u00e9 Gomes -- the Portuguese midfielder signed by Valencia from Benfica and then sold, at a handsome profit, to Barcelona -- as an example.\n\nAt the point of the pyramid, though, are the world's elite, the clubs to whom Mendes sells the very best players at the very highest prices. Even here, though, his influence can run deeper than most. When his client Mourinho was the manager of Real Madrid, Mendes regularly used Mourinho's office at the club's training ground as a base from which to conduct Gestifute business, including meetings with potential investors into other clubs. Clubs like Wolverhampton.\n\nA year into their involvement in Mendes's system, what Wolves must establish now is where it sits in this firmament. Wolverhampton may be the perfect opportunity for Mendes to have an influence over a club \"in the very center of world football, in the Premier League,\" Russo said, a place where his clients can cut their teeth before moving on to England's giants.\n\nMore than that, though, Wolves must ask if it is a good thing. Plenty of clubs that have been part of his network, certainly, might suggest that what is best for Mendes is not always best for them.\n\nWhen Fikret Orman took over as the chairman of Besiktas, in Istanbul, in 2011, the club's finances were so dire that he had to introduce a policy of \"sacrifice,\" encouraging players to take salary reductions to try to reduce the team's debts. Even now, Orman said, he \"has not made any decisions that will harm the club's balances in the long run, even if they bring success in the short term.\" Before Orman's arrival, Besiktas had acquired six Mendes players in a year.\n\nThere was a similar influx at Dynamo Moscow in 2005, followed by further financial problems (though the Russian club last year signed a \"memorandum of understanding\" once again with Gestifute). At Valencia, meanwhile, supporters turned on Nuno, the coach. They came to see him as a Mendes pawn, and protested against the ownership of Peter Lim, another close friend of the Portuguese agent.\n\nTo those at Molineux, though, now is not the time for those thoughts. The season is about to begin. For once, it is full of promise. Wolves beat Leicester last Saturday, with Jota creating the only goal for his countryman Cavaleiro.\n\nAs the game ticked down to its end, the home fans started to sing Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo's name. For them, it is enough that the coach and players are all here. How they got here, and how long they will stay, is a question for another day.", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "title": "The Owner Brought the Money.

A remodelled Wolves under new manager Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santos kicking off against the favourites for promotion. To further whet the appetite no fewer than 13 players were making their debut: for Wolves the \u00a315m Portuguese midfielder R\u00faben Neves was joined by on loan Atl\u00e9tico Madrid winger Diogo Jota; for Boro there was a new attacking focal point in Britt Assombalonga, while Jonny Howson and full-back Cyrus Christie had also been brought in for big fees.\n\nAfter a stirring show of support for goalkeeper Carl Ikeme who is fighting leukaemia, the match began in highly competitive spirit with both teams attempting to assert their style of play on the match. In the 13th minute the Wolves winger Bright Enobakhare had a penalty appeal turned down after he appeared to be caught by George Friend. A minute later a Friend free-kick up the other end was deflected beyond Daniel Ayala for a corner.\n\nWolves were trying to settle into a passing game that relied on quick interchanges from their front three of Jota, Enokbare and the towering Brazilian Leo Bonatini. Boro, for their part, looked composed in defence and happy to play direct to Assombalonga, who dealt with whatever came to him.\n\nWith both teams attempting to apply a plan, it should have surprised no one that the opening goal came from an horrendous mistake. The culprit was Ayala, the centre-half looking unruffled by anything that fell his way until the point in the 31st minute when, under minimal pressure, he under-hit a pass to Friend. Bonatini seized on the ball, strolled into the area and slotted the ball low past Darren Randolph for a goal on his debut.\n\nBoro should have equalised before half-time; a Christie cross was wasted miserably by Martin Braithwaite, another new arrival, who could only watch his header to drop wide of the far post.\n\nThat chance apart the goal only served to give Wolves greater confidence, Play was flowing through wing-backs Matt Doherty and Barry Douglas, and Enobakhare was coming ever more into the game. The fans, meanwhile were trying out a number of chants for manager Nuno, and talked him into giving them a wave.\n\nThe pattern continued in the second half, Enobakhare and Doherty were causing Friend no end of bother. The 19-year-old winger, not a big money signing but a graduate of the academy, thought he had a penalty again when he lured a rash challenge out of Adam Clayton in the 63rd minute. The referee Darren Bond adjudged there to have been insufficient contact however.\n\nBoth sides looked to shake things up, with Wolves bringing on fan favourite Nouha Dicko for Bonatini, while Boro brought Patrick Bamford into the mix for Ashley Fletcher. Bamford's moment came shortly after his arrival as Randolph's half clearance fell to him outside the area. The former Chelsea man went for the volley and completely missed the ball.\n\nIn the 72nd minute Boro had their best chance of the match. It fell to Assombalonga who, of all Boro's recruits, looked the most comfortable in his new surroundings. Timing his run perfectly behind a retreating Wolves back line, he read Howson's pass and took a quick touch in the box. His second was a low shot to the far post, but Randolph dropped low to tip it wide.\n\nChristie tried to take matters into his own hands in the 83rd minute yet his driving run wasn't matched by the shot that flew over from 25 yards. And that was about that for the visitors who in the end lacked the inspiration to get something from the match. Wolves meanwhile finished as the visitors had begun, composed in defence, looking to release pace on the counter.

I was still playing, which made it more difficult, so I declined.\n\n\"But when they came back to me again I couldn't turn it down a second time,\" added Craddock, who is still a regular at matches at Molineux with the couple's three boys Joseph, Luke and Toby.\n\n\"I've had to give it a lot of thought as to what might appeal to the fans. The idea I had was kind of comic-book heroes. But also taking into account that, at Wolves, we already have our heroes on the pitch, the Billy Wrights and all the other legends of the club.\n\n\"My regular stuff can take two to three weeks to do. I couldn't do that with these as, with 23 programme covers, that would take me over a year and a half. But I've been working hard for the past four months to get them all ready in time.\"\n\nHaving met his own personal deadline to get all the covers done in time for the start of the new English Football League season this weekend, Craddock was forced into a rethink when he heard of the plight of his former Wolves team-mate Carl Ikeme, 31, who was diagnosed with leukaemia at the start of July.\n\nIt is a disease that has touched the Craddock family too. His youngest son Toby was also diagnosed with leukaemia in 2012 at the age of two and a half.\n\nCraddock's original choice for the front cover for Saturday's game with Middlesbrough was former West Ham United, Manchester United, Inter Milan, Liverpool and England captain Paul Ince, who put in sterling service late in his career with both Boro and Wolves.\n\nBut Craddock also wanted to show his support to Ikeme. And the solution was simple. He just went back to his easel and knocked out another picture, in tribute to the goalkeeper.\n\nThe club will now not only use that as the front cover on Saturday but also the legendary Ince on page three - to give the fans a taster of what is to come.\n\nMost of Craddock's professional artwork these days is non-football related.\n\nHe held his first exhibition, \"Le Bellezza Della Fusione\", demonstrating his own, unique style of portraiture, graffiti and photorealism, over in Leicestershire in 2015. And he is booked in to do the same at a gallery in Chester this autumn.\n\nBut the sight of a football net in his back garden in Cookley absolutely festooned with kids' footballs is a reminder that he is a football man and also a football fan at heart.\n\nAnd his portraits of past and present players, whether Pele or John Terry, or simply his regular commissions for ex-Wolves players, are a reminder that he too is excited at the start of another new season - especially at Molineux, where Wolves' Chinese owners Fosun have spent big on new signings, including new club record purchase Ruben Neves.\n\nBut are Wolves in the frame to repeat the promotion Craddock and his team-mates enjoyed from the Championship under Mick McCarthy in 2009?\n\n\"Another new manager has come in,\" he said. \"There's a lot of new players and everybody wants to impress.\n\n\"It's so physically demanding in this league, playing Saturday/Tuesday all the time. But, if we can keep the injuries down, then we're all excited about what's to come this season.\"", "eventUri": "eng-3335669", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "title": "Jody Craddock:

The highly-anticipated Group A clash between India and Pakistan will take place at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium on Sunday. Pakistan arrive into the clash under immense pressure, especially after their stunning loss to the USA via a Super Over in their opening game at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas earlier this week. \u201cAs for Pakistan, they have no time to waste. They have to re-group for the biggest game of the tournament against India in New York City \u2013 that\u2019s just got even bigger. Their backs are up against the wall and coming off a loss like that straight into playing a team like India, who traditionally have the upper hand in these games, is a huge challenge.\u201d \u201cIndia are in the driver\u2019s seat, definitely a more relaxed seat, but this is India versus Pakistan at a World Cup, so you can take nothing for granted,\u201d wrote Gayle in his column for the International Cricket Council (ICC). Gayle was also in praise of the USA team, who are currently on top of Group A points table following wins over Canada and Pakistan. \u201cLike the rest of the cricketing world, I was gripped by the USA\u2019s victory over Pakistan. It is a huge result which is not only incredible for them but massive for cricket as a whole.\u201d \u201cYou always expect a few upsets at World Cups and having started well by beating Canada, USA put Pakistan under the pump for pretty much the whole game. The atmosphere in Texas looked great and I think it marks the day the World Cup really started.\u201d \u201cUSA look very well organised and the way they stood up to that Pakistan attack, one of the best bowling units at the World Cup, you have to give huge kudos to them. They will now look to cash in on this result and they can absolutely reach the Super 8s \u2013 what a story that would be.\u201d Gayle also lavished praise on the talent in the USA team. \u201cAaron Jones looks right at home on the big stage. For cricket to grow in any country, you need a hero and he is the USA hero. He scored 90-odd against Canada to see them home and now this in the Super Over \u2013 what an ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup he has had already.\u201d \u201cAndries Gous is also a very, very good player, I\u2019ve watched him in a few tournaments in the US. He\u2019s a very good striker of the cricket ball and is very good against spin. Steven Taylor is a quality player, Nitish Kumar can bat as well and Corey Anderson brings the experience. They know the conditions very well and these grounds do not have big boundaries, so if they get going, they can hurt you.\u201d Gayle also reckons co-hosts and two-time winners West Indies are tipped by many to go all the way and win the tournament, but admitted it\u2019s never quite as simple as that. \u201cUSA are making the most of home advantage so far and my hope is that the West Indies can do the same. It\u2019s never easy playing at home, especially on a big occasion like a World Cup, because the expectation is so high.\u201d \u201cIt is actually quite rare for a home team to win a T20 World Cup but hopefully this year will be a change of fortune. We can lift the trophy on June 29 in Barbados, for sure. Having not qualified for the last ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup, this tournament is so important for cricket in the Caribbean. This is a huge thing for the players to step up and be counted.\u201d \u201cWe started with an edgy win over Papua New Guinea but sometimes an edgy win is a good win. It was important to start on a winning note and now they just need to kick on, make sure they get to the Super 8s and then look to take it further. It\u2019s up to the players now to entertain the fans and make sure we get some quality support in the stands, and fill it up,\u201d he concluded. \u2013IANS nr", "summary": "<p>New York, June 8 (IANS) Legendary West Indies big-hitting batter Chris Gayle said Pakistan have got no time to waste following their shocking defeat to Men\u2019s T20 World Cup co-hosts&#8230; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://indianews.com.au/t20-world-cup-pakistan-have-no-time-to-waste-their-game-against-india-has-just-got-bigger-says-gayle/\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">T20 World Cup: Pakistan have no time to waste, their game against India has just got bigger, says Gayle</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au/t20-world-cup-pakistan-have-no-time-to-waste-their-game-against-india-has-just-got-bigger-says-gayle/\">T20 World Cup: Pakistan have no time to waste, their game against India has just got bigger, says Gayle</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://indianews.com.au\">Australia India News</a>.</p>", "url": "https://indianews.com.au/t20-world-cup-pakistan-have-no-time-to-waste-their-game-against-india-has-just-got-bigger-says-gayle/", "image": "https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202406073171937.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:49:43", "author": "India News Newsdesk", "authors": ["India News Newsdesk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": 0.028}

The company has announced upcoming Galaxy AI features for the Galaxy Watch. The update won\u2019t be available until later this year, but we have a preview of what\u2019s to come. If you like what you see and have a compatible Galaxy Watch, you can sign up for the beta beginning in June. According to the press release, the AI-infused features range from \u201ccomprehensive health insights\u201d to \u201cmotivational encouragement,\u201d hopefully better than the push notifications I get now from Samsung Health reminding me to move on the week my body is feeling least likely. Hopefully, the Galaxy Watch 6 will be able to tell those times I\u2019m too tired with the Galaxy AI-infused Energy Score. Like Fitbit\u2019s Daily Readiness score, Samsung\u2019s Energy Score will factor in your abilities based on how well you slept, how much you\u2019ve been sleeping, and whether you\u2019ve been active. Samsung said its sleep algorithms will also improve through this AI edification. The Galaxy Watch promises to offer better Sleep Insights, including metrics on how often you move during your rest and the sustained heart rate overnight. For the fitness-minded with a Galaxy smartwatch, stats will be offered for \u201cmore tailored training.\u201d This includes details on your Aerobic Threshold (AT) / Anaerobic Threshold (AnT) heart rate and a Functional Threshold Power (FTP) metric for bikers. For other workouts, Samsung will compile a Workout Routine using AI as your workout coach, while the Race option helps you train for more endurance on the next scheduled marathon. Samsung notes this is \u201cjust the beginning\u201d of AI features coming to the Galaxy portfolio. Unfortunately, there is nothing to paw at, but the beta will arrive next month for compatible Galaxy Watches. It\u2019ll be available for the Galaxy Watch 4 and above releases. It\u2019s safe to assume that, like Fitbit Premium, which is required to unlock the Daily Readiness Score on the Google Pixel Watch, the Galaxy AI features will need a subscription down the line. In the fine print, Samsung states that the Galaxy AI features are free until 2025.", "summary": "<img class=\"type:primaryImage\" src=\"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_80,w_636/496acb091e14233ecf9aa11dea6cc3bb.jpg\"/><p>Samsung may beat Google to the punch in integrating AI into its wearables.

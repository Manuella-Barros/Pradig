Speaking at the launch of the UN Global Compact Network Caribbean and Sustainable SME and Supply Chain Programme, Kerrie Symmonds underlined the importance of this foreign policy drive to deepen Barbados\u2019 engagement with the UN multilateral system. \u201cThis exercise represents our commitment to have a proactive foreign policy and frankly, it represents an opportunity to deepen our relationship with the UN multilateral system,\u201d he said. Since taking office, the Mia Mottley administration has expanded Barbados\u2019 UN presence from the 17 agencies initially housed at UN House to include the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) last year and, imminently, the UN Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO). The UN-Habitat body is also set to open an office by year-end. Symmonds highlighted the partnership with the private sector to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and embed its 10 core principles around economic competitiveness and social equity in business. \u201cUnless it is reinforced in the minds of every business operator in Barbados, we will never achieve universal application,\u201d he said of the principles, which include non-discrimination, anti-corruption, collective bargaining rights and environmental protection. He stressed the importance of eradicating workplace discrimination based on race, gender and disability, as well as child labour exploitation. \u201cThere must be no abuse or discrimination of our disabled people but equality of opportunity for all,\u201d he said. On corruption, the minister said: \u201cFor Barbados, there is no room for corruption\u2026 But there must also be a commitment in the private sector because he who bribeth is as guilty as he who is taking the bribe.\u201d Barbados, renowned for robust labour rights and representation, would continue upholding fair working practices across sectors, Symmonds added. Pointing to the prime minister\u2019s climate change campaigning amid events such as India\u2019s record temperatures, he said responsible green business practices were essential. \u201cOur PM has championed this cause\u2026 Her voice has transcended borders to raise attention to the crisis moment we live in. Barbados expects businesses here will do their part too by harnessing green technologies and responsible environmental policies.\u201d Adherence to the principles would enhance Barbados\u2019 investment and trade prospects, the minister argued. \u201cThose who trade with businesses taking these issues seriously are increasing around the world.\u201d He added: \u201cIf you applied all of these principles in the private enterprise of Barbados, the benefit for this country would be an opportunity for greater investment flows because people will want to invest in a country that is making sure that they look after people\u2019s rights, look after the environment, ensure that there\u2019s collective bargaining in the workplace, the avoidance of improper labour practices, and of course the avoidance of corruption.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Barbados is significantly bolstering its diplomatic relationships and reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development, the foreign minister has said.

{"id": 223754762, "title": "Lea Seydoux hits out at Macron\u2019s \u2018crazy\u2019 remarks about Gerard Depardieu", "text": "Lea Seydoux has called out French president Emmanuel Macron for saying that Gerard Depardieu \u201cmakes France proud\u201d, amid sexual misconduct allegations against the veteran actor. The Paris-born actor, 38, said it gave a \u201cvery bad image of our country\u201d but praised younger generations for being \u201cvery active\u201d in calling out such issues. Last December, Macron sparked outrage after he claimed that Depardieu was the target of a \u201cmanhunt\u201d, telling broadcaster France 5 that he was a \u201cgreat admirer\u201d of the actor and that he \u201cmakes France proud\u201d. \u201cSo strange. It was crazy,\u201d Seydoux told The Sunday Times culture magazine of Macron\u2019s comments. \u201cWhy say that? It was really something. It\u2019s crazy he said that, the president. Crazy.\u201d Earlier this month, Macron clarified his comments and claimed that they had been \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d, emphasising that he was not \u201ccomplacent\u201d around issues such as sexual harassment. \u201cI just want a respect for our principles, such as the presumption of innocence. These same principles which will allow justice to rule next October and that is a good thing,\u201d he told French women\u2019s magazine Elle. Judges this month ordered Depardieu, 75, to stand trial in October over allegations of sexual assault brought by two women, who worked with him on film sets in 2014 and 2021. The actor, regarded as one of the biggest French stars of the late 20th century, has been publicly accused of rape or assault by 20 women. He denies any wrongdoing and says all of his relationships with women have been consensual. Prosecutors confirmed that Depardieu would appear in court in October over the 2021 assault allegations. \u201cHe will be judged in October 2024 for sexual assaults allegedly committed in September 2021 against two victims, during the filming of the movie Les volets verts (The Green Shutters),\u201d prosecutors said. Macron\u2019s latest remarks came after a group of French actors, including Oscar winner Juliette Binoche, signed an open letter accusing their country of being \u201cenormously backward\u201d in dealing with sexual misconduct. The letter marked the start of the Cannes Film Festival, and saw Binoche and 100 other actors and cultural figures claim that, despite years of campaigning to expose predatory behaviour by men, \u201cthe agressors are protected by collective denial\u201d. Elsewhere in her interview, Seydoux criticised attitudes towards ageing in America, declaring that she feels fortunate to be part of the film industry in Europe. The Blue is the Warmest Colour star said she views Hollywood as more of a \u201cbusiness\u201d where the public are \u201cinfantalised`\u201d by everything from \u201cthe adverts you see in the streets to the writing they put on their cereal packets\u201d. \u201cMaybe because it\u2019s a young country?\u201d she continued. \u201cSo people want to stay young forever? It\u2019s a society that is infantilising and you cannot get older in America. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a disease there, getting older. It\u2019s the same for men.\u201d The star, who played Dr Madeleine in 2015\u2019s James Bond film Spectre and again in 2021\u2019s No Time to Die, also suggested it would be \u201cweird\u201d to make a Bond film today with \u201ca guy who is super-misogynistic.\u201d \u201cIt has to reflect the society we\u2019re living in,\u201d she added. She most recently starred in sci-fi epic Dune: Part Two, opposite Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya and Florence Pugh. Rape Crisis offers support for those affected by rape and sexual abuse.

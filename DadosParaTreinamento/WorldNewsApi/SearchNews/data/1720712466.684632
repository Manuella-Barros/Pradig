{"id": 232019610, "title": "Karen's Kitchen: Thai tuna salad from former MasterChef contestant", "text": "This recipe was made for me many years ago, writes Karen Skewies. I always remembered its amazing flavours so a while back I recreated it \u2013 the issue was that I never followed a recipe, I just made it to suit my taste. My friends kept asking what was in it and encouraged me to write it down. So after many requests, I put pen to paper, but honestly I still adapt it to suit my taste buds. For example, I love limes so sometimes I add some extra lime juice, or extra ginger. It is great as a lunch dish served with prawn crackers. Ingredients \u25a0 2 cans tuna (145g) \u25a0 1 grated lime and juice (+1 to serve) \u25a0 2tsp fish sauce \u25a0 1tbsp sweet chilli sauce \u25a0 Half a chopped chilli red pepper \u25a0 1tsp grated ginger \u25a0 1tbsp fresh coriander \u25a0 Handful of salted peanuts or cashew (if you want to make it extra special) \u25a0 Prawn crackers to serve Method 1. Grate and juice the lime. 2. Grate the ginger. 3. Chop the chilli pepper, coriander and peanuts. 4. Put the tuna in a bowl and break up the chunks. 5. Add the grated lime and juice, fish sauce, chilli sauce, chopped red pepper, grated ginger, coriander and peanuts. Mix well. 6. Chill for 30 minutes in the fridge. 7. Serve with prawn crackers and slices of limes. *Don't miss the latest headlines from around Lanarkshire. Sign up to our newsletters here. And did you know Lanarkshire Live had its own app?

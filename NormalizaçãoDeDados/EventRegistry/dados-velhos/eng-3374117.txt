Saturday, killing about 20 people and injuring scores more, as carriages slammed into each other, officials said.\n\nRescuers and local people worked into the night searching for survivors in the overturned and mangled carriages, some piled on top of each other. The death toll in the the northern state of Uttar Pradesh was expected to rise, officials said.\n\nAt least eight carriages derailed in the crash close to Muzaffarnagar, about 130 km (80 miles) north of the capital New Delhi, as the train travelled towards the Hindu holy city of Haridwar, police said.\n\nTrain crashes are frequent in India, which has the world's fourth biggest rail network. Poor investment in past decades in the vast network and rising demand means overcrowded trains are running on creaking infrastructure.\n\nSaturday's accident is at least the fourth major passenger train derailment this year and the third in Uttar Pradesh in 2017. A crash in November in Uttar Pradesh killed 150 people.\n\nA senior police officer in the state, Anand Kumar, said close to 20 people had been killed and more than 80 injured.\n\nSanjeev Balyan, a Muzaffarnagar lawmaker, had earlier told Reuters that at least 14 people had been killed.\n\n\"We are struggling to pull out injured, and are waiting for gas cutters to arrive. It's too dark to launch a full fledged search operation, but our teams are trying their best,\" said Ajay Pandey, a senior police officer at the site.\n\nThe national authorities sent disaster teams to help.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a message on Twitter saying he was pained by the derailment of the Utkal Express, offering condolences to families of those killed and wishing a speedy recovery to the injured.\n\nIn June, Reuters reported that a planned US$15 billion safety overhaul of India's rail network was facing delays as the state steel company could not meet demand for new rails.\n\nThe network is in the middle of a US$130 billion, five-year modernisation. The government launched the additional safety overhaul programme in February to tackle a surge in train accidents in the past two years blamed on defective tracks.\n\nA senior official in the Uttar Pradesh government, Arvind Kumar, told the Hindustan Times the train driver had slammed the brakes on after spotting maintenance work on the tracks that was not properly signalled, the newspaper reported.\n\nAnil Saxena, a spokesman for the railways, said it was too early to speculate about the causes of Saturday's crash.\n\n(Additional reporting by Euan Rocha, Rupam Jain and Suvashree Choudhury; Writing by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Toby Chopra and Edmund Blair)", "eventUri": "eng-3374117", "timeCrawl": "19:54:00", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:54:00Z"}

A crash in the region in November killed 150 people.\n\nA senior police officer in the state, Anand Kumar, said 20 people had been killed and more than 80 injured.\n\nSanjeev Balyan, a lawmaker from Muzaffarnagar, the city nearest to the crash, had earlier told Reuters that at least 14 people had been killed.\n\nAjay Pandey, a senior police officer at the site, said: \"We are struggling to pull out injured, and are waiting for gas cutters to arrive. It's too dark to launch a full fledged search operation, but our teams are trying their best.\"\n\nThe national authorities have dispatched disaster teams to help.\n\nIndia's prime minister, Narendra Modi, sent a message on Twitter saying he was pained by the derailment of the Utkal Express, offering condolences to families of those killed and wishing a speedy recovery to the injured.\n\nThe network is in the middle of a $130bn, five-year modernisation. The government launched the additional safety overhaul programme in February after a surge in train accidents in the past two years was blamed on defective tracks.\n\nA senior official in the Uttar Pradesh government, Arvind Kumar, told the Hindustan Times the train driver had slammed the brakes on after spotting maintenance work on the tracks that was not properly signalled.\n\nAnil Saxena, a spokesman for the railways, said it was too early to speculate about any potential cause of Saturday's crash.", "eventUri": "eng-3374117", "timeCrawl": "19:59:00", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:50:00Z"}

of the Utkal Express, which runs on the Puri-Haridwar-Kalinga route, derailed at Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh. Several travellers are still feared trapped in the wreckage.\n\nThe images showed a number of mangled bogies, one of which crashed into a nearby house. The damaged coaches were S1 to S10 sleeper class, third AC B1, second AC A1 coach and the pantry. The train was coming from Puri in Odisha and going to Haridwar in Uttarakhand, normally a journey of about 36 hours.\n\nThe incident occurred at around 5:50 in the evening. The locals were the first to reach the spot and extricate trapped passengers from the train. Heavyweight cranes and gas cutters were being used and locals were seen helping out those engaged in rescue work.\n\nThe National Disaster Response Force and Uttar Pradesh's Anti-terror Squad (ATS) rushed to the accident site. The ATS suspects foul play. Uttar Pradesh ADG (Law and Order) Anand Kumar said that top priority was being accorded to ensure prompt rescue and relief work. Kumar, however, refused to comment on the reason behind the derailment, saying, \"He was not in a position to ascertain the same as of now.\"\n\nUttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma told CNN-News18 that it was a sad incident. \"I cannot say anything about the number of deaths and injuries until all the facts are on the table.\" Railways rescue workers are busy working, and ensuring that those injured in the accident are brought to hospitals, he said.\n\nThe rescue operation hit a roadblock after the darkness set in. \"The government has ensured proper lighting facilities at the spot. The administration is currently in touch with local authorities, too,\" Sharma said.\n\nUnion Health Minister JP Nadda, keeping the gravity of the situation in mind, asked the Central Trauma Care teams to remain on standby as they can be put into service anytime.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi expressed extreme pain over the Utkal Express derailment and said the Railway Ministry and the state government were doing everything possible and providing all assistance required.\n\nHe said the situation was being monitored very closely by the Railways Ministry.\n\nRailway Minister Suresh Prabhu ordered an inquiry into the derailment. He said he was personally monitoring the situation and strict action will be taken in case of any lapse. Prabhu also announced Rs 3.5 lakh exgratia for those who lost their lives, Rs 50,000 for the seriously injured and Rs 25,000 for those who received minor injuries.\n\nUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced Rs 2 lakh compensation for the kin of those killed and Rs 50,000 for the injured. Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik has also announced Rs 5 lakh exgratia to the kin of any Odia passenger dead in Utkal Express derailment. He also asked two of his ministers to reach the site and expedite rescue and relief operations.\n\nThe train tragedy in Muzaffarnagar is the second major of the year. In January 2017, nine coaches and one diesel engine of the 18448 Jagdalpur-Bhubaneswar Hirakhand Express derailed in Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh. Forty-one people had died and 68 had suffered injuries.", "eventUri": "eng-3374117", "timeCrawl": "17:37:00", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:37:00Z"}

I think that was the last thing I remember.\" He sustained a minor injury on his head and was rescued by local people.\n\nThere was minor skirmish between the local residents and the police when the crowd which was busy in rescuing people accused the administration of reaching late but soon the rescue mission started in full speed with all the senior police officers of Meerut and Muzaffarnagar range, BJP MP from Muzaffarnagar Sanjeev Baliyan, Suresh Rana, a member of Yogi Adityanath government, on the spot supervising the rescue mission with equipmen to cut open the mangled coaches.\n\nHundreds of passengers came out from other coaches and started looking for their friends and fellow passengers.

The State government will also pay \u20b950,000 for the injured and for treatment in any hospital.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi expressed extreme pain over the accident and assured that the Railway Ministry and State government were doing everything possible to provide the required assistance.\n\nFrom January-June this year, total 29 serious train accidents took place out of which 20 accidents happened due to train derailment that killed at least 39 people and injured 54. In 2016-17, 78 derailments took place on railway tracks two of which were attributed to 'coach defect.'\n\nIn the last five years, between 2012-13 and 2016-17, out of total 586 accidents, 308 occurred due to derailments and 199 because of unmanned level crossings.

on Saturday, sending coaches ramming into each other as well as a house close to the tracks.\n\nThe train from Puri in Odisha was on its way to Haridwar in Uttarakhand. It derailed near Khatauli station around 5.45pm.\n\nUP principal secretary (home), Arvind Kumar, said the train got derailed as the driver slammed the brakes suddenly. \"There was (repair) work on the tracks but no flagging was done,\" he added.\n\nRailway sources denied the charge.\n\nThe driver \"felt a jerk and realised that the derailment had happened. He couldn't apply the brakes\", one of the sources said.\n\n\"According to him, either the soil beneath the tracks was loose because of the rain or the railways didn't do periodic ultrasonic fault detection on the tracks,\" the source added.\n\nThe train was travelling at 106kmph. It normally covers the distance between Puri and Haridwar in 36 hours.\n\nThe engine and five bogies apparently crossed the spot where the train derailed.\n\nA team of UP's anti-terrorist squad was sent to the site to investigate if it was a case of sabotage or not.\n\nRailway minister Suresh Prabhu ordered an inquiry and directed railway board chairman and other officials to oversee rescue and relief operations. \"I am personally monitoring the situation,\" he tweeted.\n\nHe also announced an ex gratia of Rs 3.5 lakh for the dead and Rs 50,000 for those with serious injuries.\n\nThe railways have issued helpline numbers: 9760534045/5101 94106 09434, 0121-2604977, 94544 55183, 9410609434, 0121-2604977.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi expressed condolences over the deaths.\n\n\"Extremely pained by the derailment of the Utkal Express in Muzaffarnagar. My thoughts are with the families of the deceased,\" he said in a tweet.\n\nUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath ordered free treatment and directed ministers Suresh Rana and Satish Mahana to reach the site.\n\nOdisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik announced Rs 5 lakh ex gratia to the kin of Odia passengers killed in the accident and Rs 50,000 for the injured.\n\nUnion minister Sanjeev Baliyan, who represents Muzaffarnagar in Lok Sabha, reached the spot soon after the accident.\n\nTwo bogies of the train rammed into the house of Pintu Choudhary, eyewitness Sandeep Rodhia said, adding that five people, including a tea stall owner, were crushed by the bogies.\n\nCranes and gas-cutters were used to lift and cut the mangled coaches and extricate passengers. More than 20 bodies were taken out.\n\nLocal people assisted the rescue. Rizwan, a photo studio owner in Muzaffarnagar, said: \"I took out 18 bodies.\"\n\nA team of 44 NDRF personnel, equipped with rescue equipment, and 12 companies of PAC were sent to the spot for rescue.\n\nSenior administration officials from Meerut and Muzaffarnagar also were at the spot.\n\nChief medical officer, Meerut, Dr Rajkumar said 26 government ambulances and 20 private ones were sent to the accident site for ferrying the injured to hospitals in Meerut.\n\nHe said all hospitals in Meerut were asked to keep emergency and critical wards prepared for the injured.\n\nA separate 50-bed ward has been prepared for treatment of the mishap victims. A team of health officials from Meerut also rushed to the accident site.\n\nLeaves of doctors of all government hospitals in Meerut have been cancelled with immediate effect. The commissioner has issued orders for all government doctors to report to their respective hospitals at the earliest.\n\nThe rescue operation was complete around midnight, and all the injured hospitalised, railway minister Suresh Prabhu tweeted.", "eventUri": "eng-3374117", "timeCrawl": "20:10:00", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T20:10:00Z"}

Picture courtesy Twitter\n\nAt least 18 people were feared killed and over 100 others injured, including women and children, when Haridwar bound Kalinga Utkal Express train derailed in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar district, about 500 kilometres from here, on Saturday.\n\nEye witness accounts claimed that the number of dead was more and said that many people were still trapped inside the badly mangled coaches of the train.\n\nThe number of injured was put at over 100. The death toll could go up as many of the injured since many are said to be in critical condition.\n\nAdditional director general of UP police, law and order, Anand Kumar told reporters that a large number of passengers were injured in the mishap.\n\nUnion minister Sanjiv Baliyan, who hailed from Muzaffarnagar, said that he had seen many dead inside the coaches.\n\nPolice sources said that the mishap occurred near Khatauli railway station, which is 22 kilometres from the district headquarters, around six in the evening. The train was scheduled to reach Haridwar, a pilgrimage town in Uttarakhand around nine in the evening.\n\nSources said that ten coaches of the train, which was on its way to Haridwar in Uttarakhand from Puri in Odisha, derailed near the outer cabin near Khatauli. One of the coaches also rammed into the houses, which were close to the railway tracks.\n\nOfficials said medical teams had reached the spot from Meerut, Saharanpur and other nearby districts. Over 65 ambulances were pressed into service to ferry the injured to the hospital.\n\nThe injured were admitted to the nearby hospitals in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar, the officials said adding that hospitals in the NCR region had been put on alert following the mishap. Some of the injured were stated to be in a critical condition.\n\nThe derailed coaches had climbed on other coaches, making the rescue work difficult. Gas cutters were pressed into service to cut through the mangled coaches to pull out the passengers, who were trapped inside the derailed coaches.\n\nSources said that over 100 passengers were pulled out of the derailed coaches so far. Locals were the first ones to reach the spot and rescue the passengers.\n\nNDRF team had also rushed to the spot to assist in the relief and rescue operations, officials here said.\n\nOfficials here said that the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) team of the UP police had also rushed to the spot to investigate if sabotage was behind the mishap.\n\nSources said that the train was travelling at a high speed when it derailed. 'There was a jolt before the coaches jumped the rails,'' said one of the passengers.", "eventUri": "eng-3374117", "timeCrawl": "17:31:00", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:31:00Z"}

to the derailment that killed at least 11 people and injured around 60 others, a government official said on Saturday. (LIVE\u2009UPDATES)\n\nUP's principal secretary (home) Arvind Kumar said the accident was caused by the sudden application of brakes. \"There was some work on the tracks, but no flagging was done,\" he told Hindustan Times.\n\nRailway sources, however, told HT that the driver did not apply the brakes. \"He felt a jerk and realised that the derailment had happened. He couldn't apply the brake. According to him either the soil beneath the track was loose due to rains or the railways didn't do periodic ultrasonic fault detection of tracks,\" the source said.\n\nApparently, the engine and five bogies of the train had crossed the spot smoothly when the accident happened.\n\nThe Haridwar-bound Kalinga Utkal Express derailed in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar district on Saturday when the driver applied sudden brakes as some repair work was going on the tracks.\n\nThe Puri-Haridwar train got derailed near Khatauli station at 5:45 pm.\n\nPrime minister Narendra Modi expressed extreme pain over the accident and assured that the railway ministry and state government were doing everything possible to provide the required assistance.\n\nRailway minister Suresh Prabhu ordered an inquiry into the derailment, adding that he was personally monitoring the situation and that strict action would be taken in case of lapses.\n\nBJP MLA from Khatauli, Vikram Singh Saini alleged conspiracy as repair work was on when the train was passing.\n\nSeveral people were reportedly injured but officials confirmed their numbers as 20. The figures are expected to go up.\n\nWitnesses said at least 20 bodies were taken out after cutting iron rods of the train's windows.\n\nRescue work is underway, with teams of the National Disaster Response Force being mobilised to add to the efforts.\n\nRailways have issued helpline numbers: 9760534045/5101 94106 09434, 0121-2604977, 94544 55183, 9410609434, 0121-2604977\n\nRailway minister Suresh Prabhu ordered an inquiry into the derailment and promised strict action in case of lapse.

The train was on its way to Haridwar from Puri, Odisha. The UP DGP office in a press release confirmed the number of deaths and said that two NDRF teams and 65 ambulances were rushed to the site of derailment.\n\nSources said that the railway track was broken at one point which led to the derailment. Eye witnesses said that the train was running at a high speed when the derailment took place at around 5.46 pm. The injured passengers were rushed to a Muzaffarnagar hospital. The impact of the derailment was so strong that one bogie crashed into another, leaving several passengers trapped inside. One bogie also rammed into a house located along the railway track.\n\nGas cutters were used to cut open the bogies and rescue those trapped inside. The locals rushed to help the injured passengers. The NDRF team and additional medical teams also reached the site and senior railway and district officials began the rescue operations. The rescue operations were later hampered due to lack of light after sunset. Ambulances were summoned from Muzaffarnagar and Meerut to ferry the patients to hospitals and all hospitals in the adjoining districts were put on high alert.\n\nUP chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed all officials to ensure proper treatment of the injured passengers. The chief minister directed two ministers, Suresh Khanna and Satish Mahana, to reach the site of derailment and supervise rescue operations. Railway spokesman Anil Saxena said that the priority was to rescue those still trapped inside and prevent loss of life. A team of the UP ATS also left for Muzaffarnagar to probe into the possibility of a sabotage or a terror angle in the case.", "eventUri": "eng-3374117", "timeCrawl": "20:16:00", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T20:16:00Z"}

A Railway spokesperson said that their main focus was on rescuing those trapped and rushing the injured to a local hospital.\n\nHowever, before the railways could reach, locals started the rescue operations by helping out trapped passengers. The impact of the accident was so severe that the tracks were uprooted at several places. The impact also resulted in the train's S2 bogey jumping over other bogies and hitting a house near the tracks causing severe damage. Residents of the damaged house managed to escape, as one of the family members witnessed the derailment and called for everyone to run inside.\n\nAn eyewitness told DNA that the tracks had recently been fixed, and new tracks demand trains travel at a desired speed limit to ensure safety. However, trains continued travelling at full speed. \"The tracks were repaired last Saturday and we had requested the railways to put up a board directing the trains to slow down, as our houses were near the tracks. However, they didn't pay heed,\" alleged Ratan Kumar, a local who lives nearby.\n\nPassengers who survived claimed that the driver of the train had applied the emergency break, when the train was travelling at a high speed for some unknown reasons. The SSP Muzffarnagar confirmed deaths of 20 passengers, adding that over 40 were injured. He said that 65 ambulances were pressed to take injured to the hospital. Local administration meanwhile had provided food and water to the stranded passengers and arranged buses to take them to their destination.\n\n\"Only a few passengers remained trapped. Bogies are being cut and they would be pulled out soon,\" the SSP said, adding that the death toll could increase as several people sustained severe injuries.\n\nAlthough officials have not declared whether the attack had a terror angle to it, a team of the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism squad under SSP Anoop Singh was rushed to Khatauli from Noida to conduct probe. The National Disaster Relief Fund, railway relief team and medical vans were rushed to the spot.\n\nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has issued directives to the state home secretary and the director general of police to personally supervise the rescue and relief operations. The Inspector General of Railways has also been rushed to the spot.\n\nWhile speaking to ANI, Adityanath said that he had deputed his cabinet ministers Satish Mahana and Suresh Rana to ensure that the injured received the best possible medical attention, and those rescued have no trouble in reaching their destinations. The Adityanath government also announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to families of the deceased, and Rs 50,000 to each of injured.\n\nThe Ministry of Railways also announced that the kin of the deceased will get Rs 3.5 lakh, while those with major injuries would receive Rs 50,000.

It was running at a speed of about 100 kmph when the accident took place,\" he said. Singh said the diverted trains would run through Shamli till the restoration work is over.\n\nThe train was coming from Puri in Odisha and going to Haridwar in Uttarakhand, normally a journey of about 36 hours. The train suffered huge damage in the accident last evening at Khatauli, around 40 km from Muzaffarnagar, which Singh described as \"very grave\". The derailment had such a massive impact that the train's one of the sleeper coaches climbed onto another, while its other end rammed into a house, shattering its facade, and leaving its occupants terrified. Two of the sleeper coaches overturned, with one of them hitting the facade of a local college.\n\nAlso Read: 23 dead after 14 coaches of Utkal Express derail near Muzaffarnagar in UP\n\nBodies of two men and as many women were pulled out by the NDRF team, which worked from nearly 9pm last night till 3am, to rescue survivors or extricate bodies with due dignity. Asked about the allegation made by several locals and some passengers that \"maintenance work\" was underway when the accident happened, the DRM said, \"It was just some routine work. And, the railway minister has already ordered an inquiry.

It was running at a speed of about 100 kmph when the accident took place,\" he said.\n\nSingh said the diverted trains would run through Shamli till the restoration work is over.\n\nThe train was coming from Puri in Odisha and going to Haridwar in Uttarakhand, normally a journey of about 36 hours.\n\nThe train suffered huge damage in the accident last evening at Khatauli, around 40 km from Muzaffarnagar, which Singh described as \"very grave\".\n\nThe derailment had such a massive impact that one of the train's sleeper coaches climbed onto another, while its other end rammed into a house, shattering its facade, and leaving its occupants terrified.\n\nTwo of the sleeper coaches overturned, with one of them hitting the facade of a local college in Muzaffarnagar.\n\nBodies of two men and as many women were pulled out by the NDRF team, which worked from nearly 9 pm last night till 3 AM, to rescue survivors or extricate bodies with due dignity.\n\nAsked about the allegation made by several locals and some passengers that \"maintenance work\" was underway when the accident happened, the DRM said, \"It was just some routine work. And, the railway minister has already ordered an inquiry.

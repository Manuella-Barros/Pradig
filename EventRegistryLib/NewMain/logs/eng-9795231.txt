'Collusive' ad group allegedly targeting conservatives faces grilling from top House committee", "body": "Missouri AG Andrew Bailey said that a case at the Supreme Court alleging \"collusion\" between President Bidens administration and Big Tech companies to silence specific speech is the \"most important First Amendment suit in this nations history.\"\n\nA controversial advertising alliance has drawn the attention of one of the most powerful House committees in Congress as critics allege it has fostered corporate collusion in order to silence certain political messages.\n\nThe Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) describes itself as a \"cross-industry initiative\" started as part of the World Federation of Advertisers that, according to a spokesperson, \"was established in 2019 to help the advertising industry address the challenge of illegal or harmful content on digital media platforms and its monetization via advertising.\"\n\n\"It was set up in the wake of the Christchurch Mosque shootings in which the killer livestreamed the attacks on Facebook,\" the spokesperson told Fox News Digital. \"This followed a slew of high-profile cases where brands' advertisements appeared next to illegal or harmful content, such as child pornography and content promoting terrorism. This included the 2017 London Times expos\u00e9 entitled 'Big brands fund terror through online adverts.'\"\n\nThe group claims to be \"apolitical\" and \"voluntary\" and says that it benefits its members by providing use of \"resources and information about best practices to learn where their advertising investments go, and to avoid placement next to illegal or harmful content that could damage their brands' reputation.\"\n\nJORDAN INVESTIGATES DAUGHTER OF JUDGE IN NY V. TRUMP CASE OVER HER WORK FOR KAMALA HARRIS, DEMOCRATS\n\n\"GARM offers voluntary frameworks to help brands choose the content they want their ads to appear next to,\" GARM's website says.\n\nHowever, GARM's critics have a different view of the organization and suggest that it has colluded with dozens of major U.S. corporations to push boycotts and suppress speech in a manner that targets conservatives.\n\nIn discussing his views on freedom of speech, GARM's leader and co-founder, Rob Rakowitz, has expressed frustration with an \"extreme global interpretation of the US Constitution\" and complained about using \"'principles for governance' and applying them as literal law from 230 years ago (made by white men exclusively).\" With this worldview, GARM pushed what it called \"uncommon collaboration\" to \"rise above individual commercial interest.\"\n\nSEVEN FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE PUSHED TECH GIANTS TO CENSOR AMERICANS, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER SAYS\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee released an extensive report outlining how it believes \"large corporations, advertising agencies, and industry associations participated in boycotts and other coordinated action to demonetize platforms, podcasts, news outlets, and other content deemed disfavored by GARM and its members.\"\n\nGARM is alleged to have worked with large companies to implement advertising crackdowns on Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, Spotify, political candidates and news outlets, including Fox News, The Daily Wire and Breitbart News.\n\n\"The Committee's oversight has shown that GARM has deviated far from its original intent, and has collectively used its immense market power to demonetize voices and viewpoints the group disagrees with -- even intervening in situations that do not have a so-called 'brand safety' concern,\" Committee Chairman Jim Jordan wrote in a letter to over 40 companies last week.\n\n\"Through its oversight, the Committee has learned that collusive activity is occurring within the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), of which your company is a member. In particular, the Committee has uncovered evidence of coordinated action by GARM and its member companies, including boycotts of disfavored social media platforms, podcasts, and news outlets.\"\n\n\"The Committee on the Judiciary is conducting oversight into the adequacy and enforcement of U.S. antitrust laws,\" the letter said.\n\nAlong with Adidas, the letter was sent to a variety of other companies, including American Express, Bayer, BP, Carhartt, Chanel, CVS and General Motors, asking them to preserve documents related to their involvement with GARM.\n\nMusk has also publicly criticized GARM and suggested taking legal action against the group while referring to it as an \"advertising boycott racket.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe WFA spokesperson, Will Gilroy, told Fox News Digital this week that the \"recent allegations by the US House Judiciary Committee against GARM for anti-competitive behavior are unfounded.\"\n\n\"Membership of GARM is entirely voluntary. Its frameworks and tools are intentionally broad, and individual companies are free to review, adopt, modify, or reject them, as they see fit,\" Gilroy said. \"The decision where and when to advertise is always down to the individual advertiser, in collaboration with their agency partners where relevant.\"\n\n\"Recent engagement with industry leaders suggests that GARM's work remains valuable and increasingly relevant as digital media continues to develop,\" he continued. \"As such, GARM will continue to live up to its commitment to help allow its members to drive more responsible marketing practices.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_miller@foxnews.com", "name": "Andrew Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency":

(David Swanson/Reuters)\n\nElon Musk's X social media platform filed an antitrust lawsuit against Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), a cross-industry organization that includes the likes of Mastercard, Protcer & Gamble, and Unilever, accusing the group of a \"massive advertiser boycott\" against X.\n\nX CEO Linda Yaccarino also confirmed Tuesday in an open letter to advertisers that X filed a complaint against GARM, the World Federation of Advertisers, and members such as Unilever, Mars, Orsted, and CVS Health. The suit was filed in a federal court in Texas.\n\n\"This is not a decision we took lightly, but it is a direct consequence of their actions,\" she wrote. \"The illegal behavior of these organizations and their executives cost X billions of dollars. Since arriving at X, I made it my mission to continue to build a platform where people, brands and advertisers can thrive in our unique, dynamic and safe environment.\"\n\nX, called Twitter before it was rebranded by Musk, filed the lawsuit after it reviewed a recent investigation carried out by the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee that found GARM allegedly \"organized boycotts and used other indirect tactics to target disfavored platforms, content creators, and news organizations in an effort to demonetize and, in effect, limit certain choices for consumers.\"\n\nThe Judiciary Committee also held a hearing last month that included testimony from Daily Wire commentator Ben Shapiro, and said the committee is trying to determine whether current U.S. laws are \"sufficient to deter anticompetitive collusion in online advertising.\"\n\nThe CEO said X has determined GARM's directive cost the social media platform billions of dollars in lost advertising revenue. Musk has often been critical of GARM and certain advertisers since he took over the company in late 2022.\n\nMusk also wrote about the lawsuit on his platform on Tuesday, describing his relationship with advertisers as \"a war\" after \"getting nothing but empty words\" two years after he took over the company.\n\nGARM and individual members named in the lawsuit have not responded to the lawsuit.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted GARM and the World Federation of Advertisers, an arm of the Davos, Switzerland-based World Economic Forum, for comment. GARM is commissioned by the World Federation of Advertisers, according to its website.\n\nIn response to the House Judiciary claims, GARM said in a statement in July that the committee's report \"does not include the 168-page transcribed interview which effectively clarifies questions on GARM's adherence to competition law policy and practices, that GARM is a voluntary organization, and that guidance from GARM is non-binding.\"\n\n\"We remain steadfast in the conviction that GARM enhances transparency in previously opaque practices relative to ad placements in digital social media,\" GARM told news outlets at the time.\n\n\"GARM creates voluntary industry standards on brand safety and suitability which media sellers and ad tech companies can voluntarily adopt, adapt or reject.\"\n\nMusk, meanwhile, has long had an adversarial relationship with advertisers on his social media platform. In 2023, during a New York Times event, he criticized major brands for trying to \"blackmail\" him and told them \"don't advertise.\" He also used an expletive multiple times before he appeared to single out Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, which had pulled advertising from X.\n\nIn June, Musk softened his tone during an advertising event in Cannes, France. He said that his previous comments were directed at \"advertisers as a whole\" and that he was making a point about free speech.\n\n\"What is not cool is insisting that there can be no content they disagree with on the platform,\" he noted, referring to major brands.\n\nIn a news release, streaming platform Rumble announced that it, too, will join the X lawsuit against GARM and the companies, similarly accusing them of violating antitrust laws.\n\n\"The brand safety standards set by advertisers and their ad agencies should succeed or fail in the marketplace on their own merits and not through the coercive exercise of market power,\" Rumble said in its complaint.\n\n\"All of this illegal conduct is done at the expense of platforms, content creators, and their users, as well as the agencies' own advertiser clients who pay more for ads as a result of their collusion.\"\n\nAccording to the WEF's website, GARM, which was created in 2019, is designed to curb the proliferation of \"dangerous, hateful, disruptive and fake content online.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is not a decision we took lightly, but it is a direct consequence of their actions,\" X Corp CEO Linda Yaccarino wrote in an open letter to advertisers.\n\nYaccarino wrote:\n\nEvery day, hundreds of millions of people come to X to be part of the only global, real-time conversation. They come to share their thoughts and hear others. To share their content and see more. To debate and be debated. To entertain and be entertained. To inspire and be inspired. There is no substitute for X.\n\nThe power of this community to bring global conversations to life was the reason I was so excited to join X as CEO in June 2023.\n\nAfter a career in media and advertising, I thought I had seen everything. Then I read the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee's report entitled \"GARM's (Global Alliance for Responsible Media) Harm\" last month. The report disclosed that their investigation had found evidence of an illegal boycott against many companies, including X.\n\nAs their report found: \"Evidence obtained by the Committee shows that GARM and its members directly organized boycotts and used other indirect tactics to target disfavored platforms, content creators, and news organizations in an effort to demonetize and, in effect, limit certain choices for consumers.\"\n\nThe consequence - perhaps the intent - of this boycott was to seek to deprive X's users, be they sports fans, gamers, journalists, activists, parents or political and corporate leaders, of the Global Town Square.\n\nTo put it simply, people are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is undermined and some viewpoints are not funded over others as part of an illegal boycott.\n\nThis behavior is a stain on a great industry, and cannot be allowed to continue.\n\n\"We tried peace for 2 years, now it is war,\" Elon Musk commented.\n\n\"Rumble has joined @X to sue a cartel of advertisers and ad agencies who conspired to block ad revenue from going to certain platforms and content creators. GARM was a conspiracy to perpetrate an advertiser boycott of Rumble and others, and that's illegal,\" Rumble stated.\n\nIn its filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Rumble named as defendants the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), as well as the advertising agency WPP and its subsidiary GroupM Worldwide.\n\nThe conspiracy centers around an initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), created by the WFA, that established arbitrary standards for the content on digital platforms where its members may want to advertise. GARM used those one-size-fits-all standards to perpetrate an advertiser boycott against Rumble and other platforms. The suit also notes that GARM has vast reach since it counts the six largest ad agency holding companies among its members, including defendant WPP.\n\n\"The brand safety standards set by advertisers and their ad agencies should succeed or fail in the marketplace on their own merits and not through the coercive exercise of market power,\" Rumble's complaint reads. \"All of this illegal conduct is done at the expense of platforms, content creators, and their users, as well as the agencies' own advertiser clients who pay more for ads as a result of their collusion.\"\n\nThe unlawful conduct alleged by Rumble is also the subject of an ongoing investigation by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in Congress. An interim committee staff report issued in July found that the way GARM has operated in this regard \"is likely illegal under the antitrust laws and threatens fundamental American freedoms.\"\n\nRumble is seeking a declaration that the defendants' conduct is illegal, a permanent injunction against the continued conduct, damages, interest, and legal fees, among other relief.\n\n\"X Corp has sued the World Federation of Advertisers in an antitrust action. It is my understanding that Rumble is joining this lawsuit - though the docket doesn't reflect that yet. This thread will detail the complaint, and further reporting on this will be found below,\" Tracy Beanz said.\n\n\"The suit alleges that WFA and GARM conspired with dozens of advertisers and others, to collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue from X. The suit argues that's that the boycott enacted was an attempt to force Twitter to adhere to certain brand safety guidelines they wanted,\" she added.\n\n\"GARM celebrated an 80% reduction in ad revenue for Twitter. The actions they (and the advertisers) took, are counter to a free marketplace. Here is where the anti-trust comes in - these advertisers took action COUNTER to their economic interests BECAUSE of their membership in this parent organization. If there was a competitive market, each platform would set the standards best for that platform, and the sheer efficiency of those standards would dictate the success (or failure) of advertisers,\" Beanz continued.\n\n\"The brand safety standards set by GARM are ideological - and so they would likely fail in the marketplace of ideas. That's me saying that, the complaint is much more...kind. The complaint alleges that the collective group of advertisers is overriding the actual consumer -- kind of counterintuitive unless your mission *is* to spread an ideological message,\" she added.\n\n\"This lawsuit was filed as a result of the House Judiciary Committee, who in their report concluded that their conduct was likely illegal under anti-trust laws,\" she noted.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Football_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's Football Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gharm", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gharm"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gharm"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tajikistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Federation_of_Advertisers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Federation of Advertisers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Yaccarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Health", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CVS Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPP_plc", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WPP plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brand safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holding company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/img_4764-1600x900.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795231", "eventUri": "eng-9795231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

This case is about more than damages - we have to fix a broken ecosystem that allows this illegal activity to occur.\"\n\nShortly after lawsuit was filed, video-sharing platform Rumble joined the lawsuit.\n\nThe conspiracy centers around an initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), created by the WFA, that established arbitrary standards for the content on digital platforms where its members may want to advertise. GARM used those one-size-fits-all standards to perpetrate an advertiser boycott against Rumble and other platforms. The suit also notes that GARM has vast reach since it counts the six largest ad agency holding companies among its members, including defendant WPP.\n\nThe House report details a coordinated effort by the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) and its Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) initiative to demonetize and suppress disfavored content across the internet.\n\nAs we noted last month, the WFA is a global association representing over 150 of the world's biggest brands and over 60 national advertiser associations which created GARM in 2019.\n\nThis alliance quickly amassed significant market power, representing roughly 90% of global advertising spend, which amounts to nearly one trillion dollars annually.\n\nGARM's Steer Team reads like a who's who of corporate America, including heavyweights such as Unilever, Mars, Diageo, Procter & Gamble (P&G), GroupM, AB InBev, L'Or\u00e9al, Nestl\u00e9, IBM, Mastercard, and PepsiCo. These corporations not only wield immense economic influence but are now revealed to be leveraging this power to control online discourse under the guise of \"brand safety.\"\n\nAs Axios notes;\n\nMeanwhile, Jonathan Turley also notes that House Judiciary Committee under Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is moving forward in demanding documents and records from leading companies utilizing the GARM system, a company that I have previously criticized. It is a welcomed effort for anyone who is concerned over the use of these blacklisting systems to curtail free speech. However, time is of the essence.\n\n...\n\nNotably, Rob Rakowitz, head of GARM, pushed GDI and embraced its work. In an email to GARM members obtained by the committee last month, Rakowitz wrote that he wanted to \"ensure you're working with an inclusion and exclusion list that is informed by trusted partners such as NewsGuard and GDI -- both partners to GARM and many of our members.\"\n\nGARM is being used by WFA to achieve what GDI failed to accomplish. The WFA sites refers to Rakowitz as \"a career change agent\" who will \"remove harmful content from ad-supported digital media.\"\n\nRakowitz's views on free speech are chilling and his work shows how these systems can be used to conceal bias in targeting the revenue of sites with opposing views.\n\nRakowitz has denounced the \"extreme global interpretation of the US Constitution\" and how civil libertarians cite \"'principles for governance' and applying them as literal law from 230 years ago (made by white men exclusively).\"\n\nHe appears to be referring to free speech. If so, it is deeply troubling. Some of us believe that free speech is a human right, not just an American right. Those \"white men\" include philosophers from the enlightenment whose ideas were incorporated in the Framer's view of inalienable rights like free speech.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com",

previously asserting that the committee's allegations of anti-competitive behavior are \"unfounded.\"\n\nAs The Post reported last week, the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to more than 40 major companies demanding more information about whether they colluded to defund news outlets and platforms that allowed political views with which they disagreed.\n\nAdidas, American Express, Bayer,

GARM.\n\n\"The Committee has learned that collusive activity is occurring within the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, of which your company is a member,\" the letter began.\n\n\"In particular, the Committee has uncovered evidence of coordinated action by GARM and its member companies, including boycotts of disfavored social media platforms, podcasts, and news outlets,\" the letter

The unfortunate reality is that despite all our efforts, hundreds of meetings and research to the contrary, many companies chose to dismiss the facts.\"\n\nThe complaint, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, X Corp. alleges that GARM, the World Federation of Advertisers, Danish energy company \u00d8rsted, and other advertisers violated antitrust law by scheming to deprive X of ad revenue.\n\nX -- which rejoined GARM last month -- is bringing the suit three weeks after the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee issued a report accusing GARM of coordinating action by corporations, ad agencies and other industry groups in order to \"demonetize platforms, podcasts, news outlets, and other content deemed disfavored by GARM and its members.\"\n\nWhen the report came out, House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) -- who has repeatedly accused tech companies, Democrats and others of collaborating to suppress conservative voices online -- tweeted that GARM's strategy is \"a coordinated boycott against conservative outlets.\"\n\nAmong other allegations, the House staff report specifically accuses GARM of colluding to cut ad revenue to X after its October 2022 acquisition by Elon Musk.\n\nFor instance, according to the report, the Danish energy company \u00d8rsted contacted GARM in November 2022 to inquire about a potential boycott of X.\n\nThe following April, an employee of \u00d8rsted said in an email to the World Federation of Advertisers and others, including GARM leader Rob Rakowitz: \"Based on your recommendations, we have stopped all paid advertisement\" on X.\n\nRakowitz denied to the House committee that GARM or the World Federation of Advertisers had recommended that \u00d8rsted stop advertising, according to the report. Rakowitz also denied to the House committee that he had recommended that \u00d8rsted stop advertising on Twitter.\n\nX alleges in its lawsuit that between November 2022 and December 2022, at least 18 advertisers that were members of GRAM stopped purchasing ads from Twitter. That group included \u00d8rsted, CVS Health, Unilever U.S., and Mars, according to the complaint.\n\nDozens of other GARM members \"substantially reduced\" their advertising on Twitter in 2023, according to the complaint.\n\nThe suit claims brand safety practices at X now \"meet or exceed those specified by the GARM Brand Safety Standards,\" but that the boycott is continuing.\n\nEstablished in 2019 by the World Federation of Advertisers, GARM members include large brand advertisers and trade associations, including the U.S.'s Association of National Advertisers, American Association of Advertising Agencies and Interactive Advertising Bureau, as well as big agencies such as Dentsu, GroupM, Havas Media, IPG, Omnicom Media Group and Publicis Media.\n\nA spokesperson for the World Federation of Advertisers said last month that allegations that GARM engaged in anti-competitive behavior are baseless.\n\n\"We remain steadfast in the conviction that GARM enhances transparency in previously opaque practices relative to ad placements in digital social media,\" the spokesperson said after the House issued its report.\n\n\"GARM creates voluntary industry standards on brand safety and suitability which media sellers and ad tech companies can voluntarily adopt, adapt or reject. This in turn allows advertisers to make choices similar to the way they buy advertising in TV, print or radio. GARM's work focuses on voluntary monetization standards while establishing voluntary steps to improve transparency on content moderation and platform design.\"\n\nOther organizations have separately raised concerns about content on X. Media Matters for America, for instance, reported last year that ads for brands including Apple, Bravo, IBM and Oracle were being placed next to pro-Nazi posts on the platform. (X responded that the ad placements highlighted in Media Matters' report were \"inorganic\" and rare.)\n\nThe Center for Countering Digital Hate also reported last year that the company was allowing racist, homophobic and antisemitic comments posted by Twitter Blue subscribers to remain online.

This case is about more than damages - we have to fix a broken ecosystem that allows this illegal activity to occur.\"\n\nShortly after lawsuit was filed, video-sharing platform Rumble joined the lawsuit.\n\nThe conspiracy centers around an initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), created by the WFA, that established arbitrary standards for the content on digital platforms where its members may want to advertise. GARM used those one-size-fits-all standards to perpetrate an advertiser boycott against Rumble and other platforms. The suit also notes that GARM has vast reach since it counts the six largest ad agency holding companies among its members, including defendant WPP.\n\nThe House report details a coordinated effort by the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) and its Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) initiative to demonetize and suppress disfavored content across the internet.\n\nAs we noted last month, the WFA is a global association representing over 150 of the world's biggest brands and over 60 national advertiser associations which created GARM in 2019.\n\nThis alliance quickly amassed significant market power, representing roughly 90% of global advertising spend, which amounts to nearly one trillion dollars annually.\n\nGARM's Steer Team reads like a who's who of corporate America, including heavyweights such as Unilever, Mars, Diageo, Procter & Gamble (P&G), GroupM, AB InBev, L'Or\u00e9al, Nestl\u00e9, IBM, Mastercard, and PepsiCo. These corporations not only wield immense economic influence but are now revealed to be leveraging this power to control online discourse under the guise of \"brand safety.\"\n\nAs Axios notes;\n\nMeanwhile, Jonathan Turley also notes that House Judiciary Committee under Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is moving forward in demanding documents and records from leading companies utilizing the GARM system, a company that I have previously criticized. It is a welcomed effort for anyone who is concerned over the use of these blacklisting systems to curtail free speech. However, time is of the essence.\n\n...\n\nNotably, Rob Rakowitz, head of GARM, pushed GDI and embraced its work. In an email to GARM members obtained by the committee last month, Rakowitz wrote that he wanted to \"ensure you're working with an inclusion and exclusion list that is informed by trusted partners such as NewsGuard and GDI -- both partners to GARM and many of our members.\"\n\nGARM is being used by WFA to achieve what GDI failed to accomplish. The WFA sites refers to Rakowitz as \"a career change agent\" who will \"remove harmful content from ad-supported digital media.\"\n\nRakowitz's views on free speech are chilling and his work shows how these systems can be used to conceal bias in targeting the revenue of sites with opposing views.\n\nRakowitz has denounced the \"extreme global interpretation of the US Constitution\" and how civil libertarians cite \"'principles for governance' and applying them as literal law from 230 years ago (made by white men exclusively).\"\n\nHe appears to be referring to free speech. If so, it is deeply troubling. Some of us believe that free speech is a human right, not just an American right. Those \"white men\" include philosophers from the enlightenment whose ideas were incorporated in the Framer's view of inalienable rights like free speech.", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org",

GARM allegedly forced its members -- a roster that includes most major ad buyers -- to enforce \"safety\" standards that required not running ads alongside \"misinformation.\" The alliance facilitated a boycott of X following Elon Musk's acquisition of the company, a boycott which, X's lawsuit claims, was only made possible by collusion.\n\n\"No small group of people should be able to monopolize what gets monetized,\" X CEO Linda Yaccarino said.\n\n\"GARM celebrated -- and took responsibility for -- the massive economic harm imposed on Twitter by the boycott, boasting within just a few months of the start of the boycott that 'they [Twitter] are 80% below revenue forecasts,'\" the X lawsuit reads.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee obtained documents, used in the lawsuit, which suggested that GARM and its members targeted conservative news outlets and used rules about \"misinformation\" as a pretext to financially harm platforms whose ideology they did not like.\n\nThe Rumble suit, filed by the same lawyers in the same court as the X lawsuit, named the World Federation of Advertisers as well as advertising mega-firm WPP and its subsidiary GroupM.\n\n\"In a competitive market, advertising agencies would compete with one another on their ability to place their customers' ads according to their customers' individual preferences and marketing plans,\" it said. Instead, \"GARM uses the market power of its members and their clients to force platforms to submit to GARM's demands.\"\n\nIn a statement, Rumble called GARM an \"advertising cartel.\"\n\nEmails reveal that Joe Barone, GroupM's Managing Partner Brand Safety Americas, admitted the group had \"Daily Wire on our Global High Risk exclusion list, categorized as Conspiracy Theories.\" In an email to Rakowitz, GroupM Executive Vice President of Global Brand Safety John Montgomery admitted that the group did not find that The Daily Wire published misinformation.\n\nGroupM CEO Christian Juhl testified opposite Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro in a House hearing on the topic, and struggled to explain the emails. He was replaced as CEO soon after.\n\nThe advertising industry is quite concentrated, and GARM served to eliminate whatever remained of competition, the suit says. Six multinational firms, known as the \"Big Six,\" are the parent companies of almost every major company that purchases ads, working as middlemen on behalf of the companies that have products to promote. GARM counted those firms and others among its members, and allowed them to speak with one voice.\n\nThat served to effectively threaten platforms: unless they censored content as vigorously as GARM demanded, they might lose almost all their advertisers.\n\nGARM is led by Rob Rakowitz, a former executive with Mars Corp., the Virginia-based candy-maker. Mars is one of four companies that comprise GARM's \"steer team,\" along with Orsted, CVS Health, and Unilever. All four are named in the X lawsuit.\n\nEmails suggest that GARM's members were at times reluctant to withhold their advertising dollars, and sought assurances from GARM that other companies were doing the same. In some cases, individual companies used GARM as a mouthpiece for their own pet issues.\n\nIn November 2022, Orsted wrote to GARM, \"I'm reaching out to you to ask you if it's possible to arrange a meeting and hear more about your perspectives about the Twitter situation and a possible boycott from many companies...we are about to make a recommendation to management about actions and when we need to consider whether we should continue promotion on the platform or find alternatives.\"\n\nOrsted ultimately removed all advertising from X \"due to brand safety concerns.\" At least 18 GARM members did the same, and others removed almost all their advertising, the suit said. In March 2023, Orsted wrote to GARM, \"some time has passed, and I am curious to know what you would advise us to do. And what are other global advertisers doing - have they come back to the platform, or are they still off?\"\n\nThe Daily Wire and The Federalist are suing the State Department, also in federal court in Texas, for allegedly backing private firms such as Newsguard and the Global Disinformation Index, which also sought to financially harm conservative news outlets.", "source": {"uri":

The suit names WFA, alongside GARM members CVS, Mars, Unilever, and clean energy company Orsted, as well.\u00d8rsted\n\n\"We tried peace for 2 years, now it is war,\" Musk posted on X in reference to the lawsuit.\n\nX's lawsuit claims that GARM \"conspired\" with brands like CVS to \"collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue\" shortly after Musk took over the company in 2022.\n\nIt's important to note that this lawsuit is not related to last year's more recent advertiser boycott of X, which occurred after Musk seemingly endorsed a far-right conspiracy theory and a Media Matters for America report found ads on pro-Nazi content. (X has an ongoing lawsuit against Media Matters as a result of that report, which it filed last year.) Musk had famously told advertisers to \"go fuck yourself\" as a result of that boycott.\n\nX CEO Linda Yaccarino posted both a video and article on X about the lawsuit on Tuesday.

Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee's report, \"GARM's (Global Alliance for Responsible Media) Harm.\" The report claims that \"evidence obtained by the Committee

effect, limit certain choices for consumers.\"\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee's report claims that \"GARM recommended that its members 'stop all paid advertisement' on Twitter in response to Mr.

According to The New York Post, the suit argues that the boycott undermined the marketplace of ideas by financially harming certain viewpoints over others.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee has also scrutinized GARM, particularly targeting Rakowitz. Internal emails obtained by the committee included one where Rakowitz allegedly bragged about X being \"80% below revenue forecasts\" since GARM targeted Musk over brand safety issues, a comment he later described as a \"self-effacing joke.\" The committee's investigation is examining whether GARM and its members violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which addresses illegal restraint of trade.\n\nAs reported by The New York Post, GARM has denied the allegations, with a spokesperson calling the claims of anti-competitive behavior \"unfounded.\" The House Judiciary Committee recently sent letters to over 40 major companies, including Adidas, American Express, Bayer, BP, Carhartt, Chanel, CVS, and General Motors, demanding information about their interactions with GARM and any potential collusion to defund certain news outlets and platforms.\n\n\"This behavior is a stain on a great industry and cannot be allowed to continue,\" Yaccarino remarked. The lawsuit represents a significant escalation in the battle over online free speech and advertising practices, spotlighting the tension between major corporations and media platforms over content and brand safety issues.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki",

Websites and apps must comply with those corp-friendly rules to get ad bookings from federation members, according to X. These requirements cover things like ensuring adverts aren't seen next to or are associated with hate speech, violent extremism, and child exploitation.\n\nTwitter was compliant with these standards, though after it was bought by Musk in October 2022, GARM took a much tougher line against the biz, it's claimed. The group issued public statements voicing concerns about the social network's ability or willingness to stick to the brand safety requirements, which X argues was a way to get advertisers to pull out of the site without the trade body explicitly telling them to.\n\nThe federation \"triggered the boycott of Twitter through public statements of its concerns with Twitter's continued compliance with the GARM Brand Safety Standards,\" as the lawsuit put it, adding that X is upset the industry body tried to force the social network to follow the rules. The global federation \"organized an advertiser boycott of Twitter through GARM, with the goal of coercing Twitter to comply with the GARM Brand Safety Standards to the satisfaction of GARM,\" it was claimed.\n\nSenior Twitter execs, including Musk, met twice with GARM in November and December and agreed to make changes to the platform. The Musketeers claim that, despite the biz now complying with GARM's requirements \"99 percent\" of the time, the \"boycott\" remains in place.\n\nNaturally, Xitter is also treating this walk-out by advertisers as a free speech issue. Businesses exercising their free speech rights of where they spread their marketing message is bad, is one way to interpret this lawsuit.\n\n\"People are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is undermined and some viewpoints are not funded over others as part of an illegal boycott. This behavior is a stain on a great industry, and cannot be allowed to continue,\" said X CEO Linda Yaccarino.\n\n\"To those who broke the law, we say enough is enough. We are compelled to seek justice for the harm that has been done by these and potentially additional defendants, depending what the legal process reveals.\"\n\nYaccarino cited on X an interim committee staff report into GARM from the US House Judiciary Committee, which concluded [PDF] the alliance's operation \"is likely illegal under the antitrust laws and threatens fundamental American freedoms.\" The House met GARM executives and subpoenaed emails for the report.\n\n\"We tried being nice for two years and got nothing but empty words,\" X CEO Elon Musk added on Tuesday. \"Now, it is war.\"\n\nSo far the lawsuit offers six pieces of evidence, which are mainly internal emails between GARM members and advertising agencies. According to Yaccarino these show that the group was advising clients which platforms to advertise on in a collusive fashion, thus allegedly breaking antitrust laws.\n\nExhibit F, for example, covers a discussion from Danish energy giant Orsted asking a member of the GARM team if it was still safe to advertise on Elon's site, adding: \"Based on your recommendations, we have stopped all paid advertisements.\"\n\nA GARM staffer responds: \"I would like to clarify that neither GARM, nor WFA, have ever made any recommendation, or proposed any action, in relation to advertiser investments on Twitter. Media investment decisions are completely within the sphere of each member and subject to their own discretion,\" adding that Twitter had made some improvements to content moderation to be more advertiser friendly.\n\nAnother exhibit contains a similar conversation with a Coca-Cola executive seeking advice about whether to advertise on Spotify in light of comments podcaster Joe Rogan made on the platform. One email thread between GARM execs has them celebrating Meta adding new content moderation tools, and how to explain these to the executive committee.\n\n\"We need to get the ExecCo to understand that we're operating with a Roosevelt doctrine of 'speaking softly and carrying a big stick,'\" it reads.\n\nVideo-hosting site Rumble, a big hit among conservative and alt-right folk, says it's also bringing similar antitrust legal action against advertisers after ads were pulled from its platform.\n\nEver since Musk took over Twitter and fired the majority of its staff and let previously banned users back on, big-name brands have been wary of using the platform to push their wares. This wasn't helped last year when Musk, on stage at a conference, told advertisers to \"go fuck themselves,\" although he has since tried to build bridges.\n\nThe federation did not have comment at time of going to press. \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gharm", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gharm"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gharm"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tajikistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PDF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Federation_of_Advertisers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Federation of Advertisers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Pharmacy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CVS Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linda Yaccarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

The suit says this turn of events cost the company billions of dollars in revenue. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for violation of US antitrust law.\n\nThe right-wing video site Rumble, founded more than 10 years ago as an alternative to YouTube and positioned as a platform \"immune to cancel culture,\" announced on Tuesday that it had filed a similar lawsuit. \"GARM was a conspiracy to perpetrate an advertiser boycott of Rumble and others, and that's illegal,\" the company posted on its X account.\n\nThe US House Judiciary Committee, which is controlled by Republicans and has expressed concern about censorship of right-wing views on social media, has been investigating GARM. In a preliminary report in July, the committee found that \"the extent to which GARM has organized its trade association and coordinates actions that rob consumers of choices is likely illegal under the antitrust laws and threatens fundamental American freedoms.\" X's lawsuit draws heavily from internal GARM emails reviewed by the congressional panel.\n\nIn a video shared to X, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said she was \"shocked\" by the evidence uncovered by the House Judiciary Committee that there had been a \"systematic illegal boycott against X.\" Yaccarino attempted to rally X users with references to free speech in her statement. While pointing directly at the camera, she alleged that the advertisers were \"targeting our company, and you, our users,\" and \"threatening your global town square.\"\n\n\"People are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is constricted,\" Yaccarino said.\n\nThe Brussels-based World Federation of Advertisers, which oversees GARM, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuits. X's lawsuit also names Unilever, Mars, CVS, and a Danish energy company as defendants, while Rumble's suit additionally targets the ad agency WPP. None of the companies immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nX's lawsuit contends that advertisers in the past had to individually strike deals with social media companies to set boundaries around what types of content they would sponsor. Through GARM, advertisers have been able to aggregate their power, establish industry standards for content moderation, and enforce them. In X's view, GARM now has too much say over the content social media platforms may allow.\n\n\"In a competitive market, each social media platform would set the brand safety standards that are optimal for that platform and for its users, and advertisers would unilaterally select the platforms on which they advertise,\" the complaint states. \"But collective action among competing advertisers to dictate brand safety standards to be applied by social media platforms shortcuts the competitive process and allows the collective views of a group of advertisers with market power to override the interests of consumers.\"", "source": {"uri": "wired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@wired.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Video hosting platform Rumble has joined the complaint.\n\nThe suit, filed in Texas on Tuesday, follows last month's publication of a report by the US House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee, which found evidence that GARM conspired to demonetize and otherwise harm \"disfavored platforms.\"\n\n\"We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words. Now, it is war,\" Musk said on X, above a post from Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski announcing he would join the case.\n\n\"This is not a decision we took lightly, but it is a direct consequence of their actions,\" X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in an open letter to all users, calling the behavior by GARM and others \"a stain on a great industry, and cannot be allowed to continue.\"\n\nAccording to Yaccarino, X has \"met and surpassed\" the requests made by GARM and other advertiser groups to improve controls and increase the effectiveness of their ads, working in good faith to allay their concerns.\n\n\"The unfortunate reality is that despite all our efforts, hundreds of meetings and research to the contrary, many companies chose to dismiss the facts. To those who broke the law, we say enough is enough,\" Yaccarino said.\n\nThe lawsuit names GARM, the World Federation of Advertisers, and GARM members CVS Health, Mars, Orsted and Unilever as the defendants, with a note that the list could be expanded later pending discovery. X is seeking treble the damages as compensation.\n\nLast month, the New York Post called GARM head Robert Rakowitz a \"fascist creep\" and self-styled \"mega-censor of everything people can read.\" The outlet was censored on multiple platforms in 2020, after publishing an entirely truthful story about Hunter Biden's laptop that the Democrats denounced as \"disinformation.\"\n\nAccording to the House report, GARM is an initiative of the WFA, which represents the world's biggest ad buyers. Its members control 90% of global marketing spending, to the tune of almost $1 trillion a year. Documents obtained by the lawmakers showed Rakowitz bragging that X was \"80% below revenue forecasts\" since GARM began targeting it. His defense was that the email was meant as a \"self-effacing joke.\"\n\nOutside observers have pointed out that GARM received money from the US government and may have been part of the notorious \"censorship-industrial complex\" exposed by the 'Twitter Files.'\n\nUSAID \"explicitly said it was reaching out to advertisers, doing 'advertiser outreach' to organize advertiser boycotts to cut financial support to disfavored websites,\" noted Mike Benz, a former Trump administration official who now runs the Foundation for Freedom Online.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news",

He slashed about half of the company's workforce and ran out top execs. He turned the platform's blue checkmark verification model into a pay-to-play scheme (a decision being investigated by regulators in the EU), and drastically reduced content moderation measures in the name of free speech - a move that invited an influx of hate speech and misinformation onto X.\n\nIn the time since Musk's acquisition, advertisers have cut ad spend on X significantly - likely over brand safety concerns - greatly hampering the platform's ability to generate revenue.\n\nNow, lashing out against advertisers' decisions, the company is pushing blame onto GARM and the WFA.\n\nGARM was established by the WFA in the summer of 2019 following the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, which were livestreamed on Facebook and reinvigorated debates about content moderation and brand safety in the digital ecosystem.\n\nThough GARM claims on its website to be \"apolitical,\" the Judiciary Committee report claims that the organization has been working to divert advertisers away from certain platforms - like Fox News, The Daily Wire, The Joe Rogan Experience and X - that hosts content with which it disagrees for political or ideological reasons.\n\nGARM has written on its website that it \"is assiduous in its adherence to competition rules,\" and that \"the recent allegations by the US House Judiciary Committee ... are unfounded.\"\n\nAt the time of publishing, neither GARM nor the WFA have responded to The Drum's requests for comment.\n\nIn her open letter to advertisers today, Yaccarino hinted that X is prepared to take additional steps against GARM and the WFA should the lawsuit not produce the company's desired result. \"To those who broke the law, we say enough is enough. We are compelled to seek justice for the harm that has been done by these and potentially additional defendants, depending what the legal process reveals.\"\n\nDespite such strong language, it has yet to be determined whether or not GARM or the WFA have breached US law. The House Judiciary notes that the actions highlighted in its report are \"likely illegal under the antitrust laws\" and that it \"will continue its investigation into the companies that participate in this conduct to inform potential legislative reform.\"\n\nVideo-sharing platform Rumble also announced Tuesday that it has filed an antitrust lawsuits against the WFA over similar concerns. The company is also suing WPP - one of the largest ad agency holding companies on Earth - and its subsidiary, GroupM Worldwide.\n\n\"The brand safety standards set by advertisers and their ad agencies should succeed or fail in the marketplace on their own merits and not through the coercive exercise of market power,\" Rumble wrote in a blog post. \"All of this illegal conduct is done at the expense of platforms, content creators, and their users, as well as the agencies' own advertiser clients who pay more for ads as a result of their collusion.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedrum.com", "dataType":

So it's pretty weird, and honestly not a great look for Yaccarino.\n\nBut X runs its own path, and this is the next step in the company's effort to reignite its flailing ad business, which is more likely losing ground due to its owners' continued divisive commentary on every hot button issue of the day.\n\nX's view, however, is that the ad industry is trying to force it to comply with its own rules around speech. And the case is actually a little more complex than it seems on the surface.\n\nThe main impetus of the filing stems from a recent Congressional appearance by political commentator Ben Shapiro, who fronted the House to claim that the GARM, a collective of advertisers who work together to challenge harmful content online, by ensuring ads are not being placed alongside it, also colludes in order to censor certain speech, by imposing restrictions on whatever GARM members don't like, as opposed to simply managing risk.\n\nAs per Shapiro:\n\n\"GARM acts as a cartel. Its members account for 90% of ad spending in the United States, almost a trillion dollars. In other words, if you're not getting ad dollars from GARM members, it's nearly impossible to run an ad-based business. And if you're not following their preferred political narratives, you will not be deemed brand safe.\"\n\nShapiro claims that GARM's rulings aim to quash certain narratives, at the behest of their members, which often sees conservative speech, in particular, targeted, and therefore restricted for monetization by guiding potential ad partners away from platforms and publications.\n\n\"GARM doesn't draw the line at what is criminal, abusive, or dangerous. Their standards also include restrictions on hate speech, harassment, misinformation, or, my personal favorite, insensitive, irresponsible, and harmful treatment of debated, sensitive social issues. Those criteria are highly subjective in theory, and they are purely partisan in practice.\"\n\nEssentially, the essence of the case here is that the GARM group is able to influence ad spending by dissuading advertisers from running campaigns on whatever it deems to be \"unsafe\" platforms, based on its chosen criteria. Which Shapiro, and many others, claim is biased in practice.\n\nAnd X is now using this as the basis for a legal challenge:\n\n\"As a condition of GARM membership, GARM's members agree to adopt, implement, and enforce GARM's brand safety standards, including by withholding advertising from social media platforms deemed by GARM to be non-compliant with the brand safety standards. When Elon Musk and other investors acquired Twitter in November 2022, GARM members reached out to GARM to learn \"[GARM's] perspectives about the Twitter situation and a possible boycott from many companies[,]\" and GARM conveyed to its members its concerns about Twitter's compliance with GARM's standards, triggering the massive advertiser boycott that followed.\"\n\nX says that the impacts of GARMs advice are still being felt at the company, despite X meeting or exceeding the regulations specified by GARM. As such, the suggestion is that GARM advises its clients based on reasons outside of the remit of its code of conduct and brand safety framework, and is based more, as Shapiro claims, on ideological grounds.\n\nWhich is a big claim, and it'll be hard to litigate in court, though it is important to clarify that X is not exactly suing individual brands for not advertising on X, as such (as many have suggested), but is actually targeting the broader industry advice group, which it feels is working against it.\n\nEffectively, X is trying to establish is a legal approach to address a perceived effort to censor speech.\n\nWhich, conceptually, is more abstract, and more difficult to prosecute, as X is really aiming to stop organizations like GARM from coordinating to advise partners to avoid platforms like X.\n\nI'm not sure how that can be built into a legal defense, nor whether it would actually have any impact on individual advertiser actions either way, as any brand can still advertise on X if they so choose, whether they normally adhere to GARM's recommendations or not. GARM is not legally binding, and if a brand doesn't agree, they can go against its recommendations, and/or disassociate with the organization. So while GARM does act as an advisory body, there's nothing stopping any brand from disagreeing with it and utilizing any platform either way.\n\nBut X seems confident that it has a case, and that it will be able to prosecute GARM for unspecified damages stemming from its advice.\n\nAnd X really needs the money right now. According to reports, the platform is currently down 50% on its 2023 revenue performance, which was already down significantly on 2022. And again, Elon Musk's continued political commentary on divisive topics seems to be the main driver of that decline, not any advertiser boycott, as such, but maybe, if X can prove that GARM coordinated to punish the platform for reasons other than brand safety, it can sue for some level of damages as a result.\n\nThough more likely, the case will prove little, and if anything, will bring further scrutiny on the reasons why advertisers are actually avoiding X, which could actually be worse for the platform in the long run.\n\nIt seems like an ill-informed case, pitting X against key ad industry groups. But Elon is very keen to use the courts as a threat.", "source": {"uri": "socialmediatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social Media Today | A business community for the web's best thinkers on Social Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_hutchinson@socialmediatoday.com", "name": "Andrew Hutchinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gharm", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gharm"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gharm"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tajikistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Yaccarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brand safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Federation_of_Advertisers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Federation of Advertisers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_issue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social issue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subjectivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(military)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (military)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abstraction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Code of conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.socialmediatoday.com/imgproxy/MSsFBsZjqo-v4ClOCoAvNMVhzplQdhxc8AxdMW45kpw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL3hfbG9nby5wbmc=.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795231", "eventUri": "eng-9795231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The group was concerned that Twitter under Musk would no longer adhere to its established brand safety standards for advertising on social media, according to the lawsuit.\n\n\"The consequence - perhaps the intent - of this boycott was to seek to deprive X's users, be they sports fans, gamers, journalists, activists, parents or political and corporate leaders, of the Global Town Square,\" X CEO Linda Yaccarino wrote in an open letter to advertisers. \"This behavior is a stain on a great industry, and cannot be allowed to continue,\" she added.\n\nGARM was established by the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), a global association for advertisers. Its membership spans several agencies and includes companies like Dell, BP, Electronic Arts, IKEA, Microsoft, and Pepsico, among others. Only four of its members are named as defendants in the lawsuit and specifically criticized: CVS Health, Unilever, Orsted, and Mars.\n\nAll four companies discontinued or greatly lowered their advertising in late 2022, shortly after Musk's $44 billion purchase of Twitter was completed. The lawsuit says 14 or more additional GARM members stopped purchasing advertising between November and December 2022. Companies that were not GARM members also paused their advertising, including United Airlines and Volkswagen.\n\nAs X's new owner, Musk implemented changes that weakened quality control on the platform, including ousting its trust and safety council and the removal of staffers that worked on content moderation. Many of the advertisers cited an increase in hate speech and misinformation on the social media platform.\n\nX did not immediately adhere to GARM's policies and rules after Musk's takeover, although X reinstated its relationship with GARM in July, making it a member of the very group they're suing.\n\nMusk also fanned the fires last November at The New York Times DealBook Summit, where he infamously told advertisers to \"go f**k themselves\" and accused corporations of trying to \"blackmail\" him with advertising deals. He tried to walk back those comments in June.\n\nThe Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee last week ordered 40 companies involved with GARM to provide documents related to their involvement in what it calls GARM's \"corporate collusion.\" A previous report from the committee provided many of the details included in the lawsuit filed Tuesday.\n\nX is seeking damages and a permanent injunction against the WFA, citing antitrust laws. Musk on social media called for \"any company who has been systematically boycotted by advertisers to file a lawsuit,\" and suggested -- without explaining further -- that the group may be criminally liable under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\n\"We tried being nice for 2 years and got nothing but empty words,\" Musk added. \"Now, it is war.\"\n\nX was joined in its lawsuit by Rumble, the right-wing video-sharing platform founded by Chris Pavlovski in 2013. Former president Donald Trump's Truth Social joined Rumble's ad platform in August 2022 as its first publisher. In a press release, Rumble called GARM -- and its creator, the World Federation of Advertisers -- an \"advertising cartel.\"\n\n\"Soon a cabal of advertisers and agencies will find out that they can't arbitrarily engineer a boycott of Rumble & X,\" Pavlovski wrote on X.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Since arriving at X, I made it my mission to continue to build a platform where people, brands and advertisers can thrive in our unique, dynamic and safe environment.\"\n\nThe Judiciary Committee also held a hearing last month that included testimony from Daily Wire commentator Ben Shapiro, and said the committee is trying to determine whether current U.S. laws are \"sufficient to deter anticompetitive collusion in online advertising.\"\n\nThe CEO said X has determined GARM's directive cost the social media platform billions of dollars in lost advertising revenue. Musk has often been critical of GARM and certain advertisers since he took over the company in late 2022.\n\nMusk also wrote about the lawsuit on his platform on Tuesday, describing his relationship with advertisers as \"a war\" after \"getting nothing but empty words\" two years after he took over the company.\n\nGARM and individual members named in the lawsuit have not responded to the lawsuit.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted GARM and the World Federation of Advertisers, an arm of the Davos, Switzerland-based World Economic Forum, for comment. GARM is commissioned by the World Federation of Advertisers, according to its website.\n\nIn response to the House Judiciary claims, GARM said in a statement in July that the committee's report \"does not include the 168-page transcribed interview which effectively clarifies questions on GARM's adherence to competition law policy and practices, that GARM is a voluntary organization, and that guidance from GARM is non-binding.\"\n\n\"GARM creates voluntary industry standards on brand safety and suitability which media sellers and ad tech companies can voluntarily adopt, adapt or reject.\"\n\nMusk, meanwhile, has long had an adversarial relationship with advertisers on his social media platform. In 2023, during a New York Times event, he criticized major brands for trying to \"blackmail\" him and told them \"don't advertise.\" He also used an expletive multiple times before he appeared to single out Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, which had pulled advertising from X.\n\nIn June, Musk softened his tone during an advertising event in Cannes, France. He said that his previous comments were directed at \"advertisers as a whole\" and that he was making a point about free speech.\n\n\"What is not cool is insisting that there can be no content they disagree with on the platform,\" he noted, referring to major brands.\n\n\"The brand safety standards set by advertisers and their ad agencies should succeed or fail in the marketplace on their own merits and not through the coercive exercise of market power,\" Rumble said in its complaint.\n\n\"All of this illegal conduct is done at the expense of platforms, content creators, and their users, as well as the agencies' own advertiser clients who pay more for ads as a result of their collusion.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"},

Four of those companies -- CVS, Unilever, Mars and the Danish energy company \u00d8rsted -- were also named as defendants in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Texas Tuesday.\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest effort by X to revive its core ad business, which has tanked since Musk's takeover. Many brands have pulled their spending over concerns that their ads might run alongside misinformation or hate speech, which Musk himself has occasionally promoted. The suit also continues Musk's habit of feuding with the advertisers whose money he relies on; last year, he told brands who had left the platform to \"go f**k yourself.\"\n\nX leaders have alternately portrayed the platform's ad business as recovering, then struggling, then recovering again. But X CEO Linda Yaccarino painted a dire picture in a video posted to the platform Monday. \"They conspired to boycott X, which threatens our ability to thrive in the future,\" she said of the GARM members, adding that the loss in advertising dollars placed the company \"at long-term risk.\"\n\nGARM did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the suit.\n\nGARM members \"agree to adopt, implement, and enforce GARM's brand safety standards, including by withholding advertising from social media platforms deemed by GARM to be non-compliant with the brand safety standards,\" the lawsuit states. After GARM publicly called on X, then known as Twitter, to comply with its brand safety standards after Musk's takeover, many GARM-affiliated companies \"abruptly discontinued or sharply curtailed their purchases of advertising,\" the suit alleges.\n\nHowever, GARM notes on its website that it \"does not interfere with a member's decision as to whether or not to invest advertising resources on a particular website or channel.\"\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to prevent GARM from continuing to make recommendations regarding advertising on X, as well as unspecified monetary damages.\n\nIt's not the first time X has filed a lawsuit related to its declining ad business. Last year, it sued the Center for Countering Digital Hate, alleging the nonprofit group violated its terms of service when it studied, and then wrote about, hate speech on the platform and blamed it for driving away advertisers. A federal judge tossed the suit in March, blasting it as an attempt to punish CCDH for protected speech.\n\nX also sued the progressive watchdog group Media Matters over its analysis highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on X -- a report that appeared to play a significant role in a massive and damaging brand revolt late last year. The suit accuses Media Matters of distorting how likely it is for ads to appear beside extremist content on X. Media Matters President Angelo Carusone called the filing a \"frivolous lawsuit.\" The case is set to go to trial next year.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clare_duffy@cnn.com", "name": "Clare Duffy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ramishah_maruf@cnn.com", "name": "Ramishah Maruf", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gharm", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gharm"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gharm"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tajikistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brand safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linda Yaccarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Countering_Digital_Hate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center for Countering Digital Hate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Matters_for_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media Matters for America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terms of service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Advertising", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2024-05-07t012431z-1690032674-rc2cl7a23rk3-rtrmadp-3-milken-conference.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795231", "eventUri": "eng-9795231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

That group included \u00d8rsted, CVS Health, Unilever U.S., and Mars, according to the complaint.\n\nDozens of other GARM members \"substantially reduced\" their advertising on Twitter in 2023, according to the complaint.\n\nThe suit alleges that the \"boycott\" has continued through the present, and asserts that brand safety practices at Twitter (now X) \"meet or exceed those specified by the GARM Brand Safety Standards.\"\n\nX -- which rejoined GARM last month -- is bringing the suit three weeks after the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee issued a report accusing GARM of coordinating action by corporations, ad agencies and other industry groups in order to \"demonetize platforms, podcasts, news outlets, and other content deemed disfavored by GARM and its members.\"\n\nAmong other allegations, that staff report specifically accuses GARM of colluding to cut ad revenue to X after its October 2022 acquisition by Elon Musk.\n\nFor instance, according to the report, the Danish energy company \u00d8rsted contacted GARM in November 2022 to inquire about a potential boycott of X. The following April, an employee of \u00d8rsted said in an email to the World Federation of Advertisers and others, including GARM leader Rob Rakowitz: \"Based on your recommendations, we have stopped all paid advertisement\" on X.\n\nRakowitz denied to the House committee that GARM or the World Federation of Advertisers had recommended that \u00d8rsted stop advertising, according to the report. Rakowitz also denied to the House committee that he had recommended that \u00d8rsted stop advertising on Twitter.\n\nEstablished in 2019 by the World Federation of Advertisers, GARM members include large brand advertisers and trade associations, including the U.S.'s Association of National Advertisers, American Association of Advertising Agencies and Interactive Advertising Bureau, as well as big agencies such as Dentsu, GroupM, Havas Media, IPG, Omnicom Media Group and Publicis Media.\n\nAt launch the group stated that members \"will work collaboratively to identify actions that will better protect consumers online, working toward a media environment where hate speech, bullying and disinformation is challenged, where personal data is protected, and used responsibly when given, and where everyone is, especially children, better protected online.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MediaPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wendy_davis@mediapost.com",

A copy of the lawsuit is available at this link (via the New York Times).\n\n\"We tried peace for 2 years, now it is war,\" Musk posted on X about the lawsuit.\n\nMusk quoted a post by X CEO Linda Yaccarino, titled \"An open letter to advertisers,\" which said in part, \"The illegal behavior of these organizations and their executives cost X billions of dollars. People are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is undermined and some viewpoints are not funded over others as part of an illegal boycott.\"\n\nX's lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and \"injunctive relief under the antitrust laws of the United States.\" According to the lawsuit, an initiative from industry trade group World Federation of Advertisers called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) represented a conspiracy -- along with dozens of advertisers -- to \"collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue\" from X.\n\nThe lawsuit comes a little over a month after X announced that the company \"reinstated our relationship with the @wfamarketers Global Alliance for Responsible Media. As of today, X is included as a member of #GARM... X is committed to the safety of our global town square and proud to be part of the GARM community!\"\n\nAccording to X's suit, \"As a condition of GARM membership, GARM's members agree to adopt, implement and enforce GARM's brand safety standards, including by withholding advertising from social media platforms deemed by GARM to be non-compliant with the brand safety standards.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that major brand advertisers -- including Unilever, Mars Inc., CVS Health and renewable energy company \u00d8rsted, which are named as defendants -- and dozens of \"non-defendant co-conspirators\" agreed to abide by GARM's standards to \"abruptly and in lockstep, boycott Twitter by discontinuing entirely or substantially reducing their previously substantial advertising purchases from Twitter.\"\n\nReps for WFA, Unilever, Mars Inc., CVS Health and \u00d8rsted did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe \"unlawful conduct\" alleged by X is the subject of \"an active investigation\" by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, the lawsuit notes. The committee's interim report issued on July 10 concluded that \"The extent to which GARM has organized its trade association and coordinates actions that rob consumers of choices is likely illegal under the antitrust laws and threatens fundamental American freedoms. The information uncovered to date of WFA and GARM's collusive conduct to demonetize disfavored content is alarming.\"", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brand safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trade association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Yaccarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Federation_of_Advertisers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Federation of Advertisers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Health", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CVS Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars,_Incorporated", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mars, Incorporated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Elon-Musk.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795231", "eventUri": "eng-9795231", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 2845, "textEnd": 2852}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Tuesday, following a report of an alleged coordinated effort to put a financial thumb on the scales of discourse, X confirmed they were taking the Global Alliance for Responsible Media and its key members to court.\n\n\"These organizations targeted our company, and you, our users,\" said Yaccarino in a video statement that covered the key points of an open letter to advertisers. \"No small group of people should be able to monopolize what gets monetized.\"\n\nIn that letter, the CEO expressed, \"Every day, hundreds of millions of people come to X to be part of the only global, real-time conversation. They come to share their thoughts and hear others. To share their content and see more. To debate and be debated. To entertain and be entertained. To inspire and be inspired. There is no substitute for X.\"\n\n\"After a career in media and advertising, I thought I had seen everything. Then I read the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee's report entitled 'GARM's (Global Alliance for Responsible Media) Harm' last month. The report disclosed that their investigation had found evidence of an illegal boycott against many companies, including X,\" she said before citing the findings.\n\nAccording to the report from the House Judiciary Committee, \"Evidence obtained by the Committee shows that GARM and its members directly organized boycotts and used other indirect tactics to target disfavored platforms, content creators, and news organizations in an effort to demonetize and, in effect, limit certain choices for consumers.\"\n\n\"To put it simply,\" Yaccarino summarized, \"people are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is undermined and some viewpoints are not funded over others as part of an illegal boycott. This behavior is a stain on a great industry, and cannot be allowed to continue.\"\n\nSharing the letter on X, Musk asserted, \"We tried peace for 2 years, now it is war.\"\n\nThe platform's CEO went on to note as they filed their complaint in Texas, \"That is why, X has filed an antitrust lawsuit against the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), and GARM members CVS Health, Mars, Orsted and Unilever. This is not a decision we took lightly, but it is a direct consequence of their actions.\"\n\n\"To those who broke the law, we say enough is enough,\" she continued. \"We are compelled to seek justice for the harm that has been done by these and potentially additional defendants, depending what the legal process reveals.\"\n\nLast week, House Judiciary Committee chair Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan submitted a letter to 40 companies and said, \"The Committee's oversight has shown that GARM has deviated far from its original intent, and has collectively used its immense market power to demonetize voices and viewpoints the group disagrees with -- even intervening in situations that do not have a so-called 'brand safety' concern.\"\n\nThe members of GARM, according to the Judiciary Committee report, control 90% of global marketing spending or roughly $1 trillion annually.\n\nHowever, WFA spokesperson Will Gilroy contended that the allegations were \"unfounded\" in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Membership of GARM is entirely voluntary. Its frameworks and tools are intentionally broad, and individual companies are free to review, adopt, modify, or reject them, as they see fit.\"\n\n\"The decision where and when to advertise is always down to the individual advertiser, in collaborations with their agency partners where relevant,\" said Gilroy. \"Recent engagement with industry leaders suggests that GARM's work remains valuable and increasingly relevant as digital media continues to develop. As such, GARM will continue to live up to its commitment to help allow its members to drive more responsible marketing practices.\"\n\nThe assurances did little to temper the call to challenge the legality of what had been done in court and, as the video platform Rumble announced they were joining in the lawsuit, Musk encouraged, \"Everyone who has been boycotted should file a lawsuit in every country they've been boycotted.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

In her words, Yaccarino accused them of a \"systematic illegal boycott\" of the X platform. Furthermore, their actions cost X and its executives billions of dollars in advertising revenue.\n\nThis group of advertisers and ad agencies allegedly conspired to prevent ad revenue from reaching certain platforms and content creators. Rights management video platform Rumble, which claimed to have joined X to sue the group, described GARM as a conspiracy. On its X account, it stated that the cartel went all out to perpetrate an advertiser boycott of Rumble and others, adding that it is illegal.\n\nNoteworthy, Elon Musk stated clearly that his social media company has waited for about 2 years, trying to see if the organization will make amends. However, he said they only got empty words in return and this has prompted the company to push for the current lawsuit which the platform filed in a federal court in Texas.\n\nConsidering that GARM came into existence to address the \"challenge of illegal or harmful content on digital media platforms and its monetization via advertising,\" the accusations levied against it reflects a significant pivot from its initial goal.\n\nElon Musk Launches Multiple Lawsuits\n\nThis is not the first time X is having to deal with an advertising challenge. Last year, Elon Musk cussed at some entities that tried to blackmail him with advertising. At the time, he also promised to provide details about the companies behind the boycott.\n\nIn what seem like the season of lawsuits, Musk renewed a suit against Sam Altman's Artificial Intelligence (AI) firm OpenAI. Per the claims, the AI giant breached its founding contract and prioritized commercialization.\n\nAmidst these lawsuit, Musk has maintained his support for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

World Federation of Advertisers, Unilever, Mars, CVS Health Corporation and \u00d8rsted A/S are named as defendants.\n\nThe Deseret News contacted a communications person at each company and did not receive an immediate response.\n\n\"This is not a decision we took lightly, but it is a direct consequence of their actions,\" said X CEO Linda Yaccarino in an open letter to advertisers.\n\nOne of the central components of the suit deals with an initiative from the World Federation of Advertisers known as the Global Alliance for Responsible Media. It was the subject of a recent House hearing.\n\nWFA spokesperson Will Gilroy told Fox News Digital this week that the allegations made by the House Judiciary Committee were unfounded.\n\n\"Membership of GARM is entirely voluntary. Its frameworks and tools are intentionally broad, and individual companies are free to review, adopt, modify, or reject them, as they see fit,\" Gilroy said. \"The decision where and when to advertise is always down to the individual advertiser, in collaboration with their agency partners where relevant.\"\n\nThrough this initiative, the suit claimed defendants conspired to withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue from Twitter.\n\n\"Concerned that Twitter might deviate from certain brand safety standards for advertising on social media platforms set through GARM, the conspirators collectively acted to enforce Twitter's adherence to those standards through the boycott,\" said the filing.\n\nThe suit said those who participate in the Global Alliance for Responsible Media agree to adopt its brand safety standards. After Elon Musk acquired Twitter, the suit said GARM \"conveyed to its members its concerns about Twitter's compliance with GARM's standards, triggering the massive advertiser boycott that followed.\"\n\nAfter this happened, the suit said defendants and dozens of nondefendant companies either stopped advertising on Twitter entirely or substantially pulled back from doing so.\n\n\"These actions were all against the unilateral self-interest of the advertisers; they made economic sense only in furtherance of a conspiracy performed in the confidence that competing advertisers were doing the same,\" alleged the suit.\n\nThe suit alleged GARM celebrated the impact this had on Twitter.\n\n\"The boycott and its effects continue to this day, despite X applying brand safety standards comparable to those of its competitors and which meet or exceed those specified by GARM,\" stated the suit.\n\nX in the filing argued the collective action among this group of advertisers allows the interests of those advertisers to override the interests of consumers.\n\nIt also claimed it was not in the best interest of companies need to advertise either.\n\n\"Due to the boycott of Twitter, prices charged by Twitter for advertising declined substantially beginning in November 2022 and remain well below those charged by X's closest competitors in the social media advertising market,\" said the suit. \"By refraining from purchasing advertising from X, boycotting advertisers are forgoing a valuable opportunity to purchase low-priced advertising inventory on a platform with brand safety that meets or exceeds industry standards.\"\n\nThis also dissuades other social media companies from lowering their prices for advertising, said the suit.\n\nIn its section on the nature of the case, the suit quoted directly from the aforementioned House report, \"The extent to which GARM has organized its trade association and coordinates actions that rob consumers of choices is likely illegal under the antitrust laws and threatens fundamental American freedoms. The information uncovered to date of WFA and GARM's collusive conduct to demonetize disfavored content is alarming.\"\n\nX said it would like a jury trial.\n\n\"We have met and surpassed the requests made by advertisers and groups such as GARM for new tools, both to improve advertiser controls and the effectiveness of our products to drive increased value for our customers,\" said Yaccarino, adding the company feels compelled to seek a remedy given the situation.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Alliance members use its resources to avoid placing ads next to content that could damage their brands' reputations, GARM says.\n\nYaccarino called the practice a \"stain on a great industry.\"\n\n\"This case is about more than damages - we have to fix a broken ecosystem that allows this illegal activity to occur,\" she wrote. \"We will continue to innovate and ensure X has a vibrant future while the courts will hold accountable those who engaged in illegal behavior.\"\n\nThe National Desk (TND) reached out to GARM for comment, but has not received a response.

The suit accuses the group of violating anti-trust laws by creating an advertising cartel designed to restrict money going to any site or publication which refuses to meet GARM's definition of \"brand safe.\" On X, Musk himself described the move as a declaration of war:\n\nChris Pavloski is the CEO of Rumble which is also joining the lawsuit:\n\nMusk encouraged other companies around the world to file similar lawsuits.\n\nThe CEO of X, Linda Yaccarino released a video statement explaining the move. \"No small group of people should be able to monopolize what gets monetized,\" she said.\n\nYaccarino makes reference to a House Judiciary Committee report that was released last month titled \"GARM'S HARM: HOW THE WORLD'S BIGGEST BRANDS SEEK TO CONTROL ONLINE SPEECH.\" That report suggested that GARM, a creation of the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), may have violated the Sherman Act. The executive summary also included a series of examples.\n\nSection 1 of the Sherman Act makes unreasonable restraints of trade illegal.15 Included in these illegal restraints are certain group boycotts and coordinated actions that harm consumers.16 Documents produced to the Committee suggest that GARM may have engaged in coordinated conduct that violates Section 1. GARM has undertaken various actions to eliminate the monetization, and in effect existence, of certain voices online. For example:\n\nAs David pointed out last month, Ben Shapiro and the Daily Wire have been particularly vocal about GARM and the harm they believe it has caused. Shapiro testified before congress about how GARM operates to cut off ad revenue to conservative sites.\n\nTargeting the advertisers of conservative news outlets is nothing new. Media Matters, Sleeping Giants and others have been doing it for years. But GARM takes this to a new level. Instead of leading campaigns one advertiser at a time, GARM can potentially coordinate 90% of the world's advertising money all at once. As William Jacobson and Kimberley Kaye suggested last month, this is industrial scale deplatforming.\n\nUltimately, they are trying to deprive you, the audience, of hearing those arguments and coming to conclusions on your own.\n\nGARM presents a particular threat because of the collective global brands it represents, and the fact that until now it operated sight unseen.\n\nBut it's the same well-worn tactic of trying to deplatform and destroy conservative media rather than debating issues on the merits, in order to control what you are allowed to say and what you are allowed to hear.\n\nHopefully, X and Rumble won't be the only companies that get in on this. Maybe a few more lawsuits will cause GARM and the WAF to reassess its commitment to deplatforming.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_sexton@hotair.com", "name": "John Sexton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gharm", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gharm"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gharm"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Tajikistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Yaccarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declaration of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Federation_of_Advertisers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Federation of Advertisers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraint_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Restraint of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Wire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Wire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deplatforming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deplatforming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sleeping Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Matters_for_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media Matters for America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media bias"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/182/ddba4f6d-cb69-4602-b1c5-cbe9e219fac9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795231", "eventUri": "eng-9795231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

CEO Linda Yaccarino posted a video Tuesday announcing X, formerly known as Twitter, filed a lawsuit against GARM, World Federation Advertisers, and top members of GARM such as Mars, CVS Health, Unilever, and Orsted. The suit is joined by Rumble, an alternative video website to popular platforms like YouTube that conservative influencers laud as a free speech alternative.\n\nThe latest antitrust suit comes after Yaccarino said she reviewed the House Judiciary Committee's investigation into GARM that found \"its members directly organized boycotts and used other indirect tactics to target disfavored platforms, content creators, and news organizations in an effort to demonetize and, in effect, limit certain choices for consumers.\"\n\nThe complaint alleges that several key advertisers coordinated by GARM conspired to boycott X by withholding advertising revenue. The complaint contends this alleged action was taken to enforce GARM's brand safety standards and was not in the individual economic interests of the advertisers but rather a collective effort to pressure X into compliance.\n\n\"The conduct of Defendants and their co-conspirators is a naked restraint of trade without countervailing benefits to competition or consumers ... The Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, does not allow this,\" the complaint states. \"The brand safety standards set by GARM should succeed or fail in the marketplace on their own merits and not through the coercive exercise of market power by advertisers acting collectively to promote their own economic interests through commercial restraints at the expense of social media platforms and their users.\"\n\nRumble also accused GARM of using a \"one-size-fits-all standards to perpetrate an advertiser boycott against Rumble and other platforms,\" according to a press release.\n\nBoth X and Rumble are seeking a permanent injunction against \"the continued conduct, damages, interest, and legal fees, among other relief,\" the press release added.\n\nThe complaint comes just one day after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled against Google in a landmark antitrust case. The judge found that Google's parent company, Alphabet, violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by paying other companies to assert dominance over other search platforms.\n\nX Corp.'s suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas Wichita Falls Division, which, according to legal experts, has a \"100%\" chance of being assigned to Judge Reed O'Connor, an appointee of former President George W.

The judge has ruled in favor of several conservative-backed efforts since the start of the Biden administration, such as blocking the Department of Defense from punishing Navy SEALs for refusing to take COVID-19 vaccines, ruling against Biden's \"pistol brace\" rule, and issuing favorable decisions for Texas to halt amendments to Title IX.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nAfter Musk purchased Twitter in April 2022 on a promise to allow more free and open dialogue, the social media platform began to see losses in advertisement revenue after major corporations pulled out due to concerns over \"hate speech\" appearing on the platform.\n\nMusk announced in May of last year that Yaccarino would serve as the company's new head following months of backlash toward Musk serving as CEO of the platform.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaelan_deese@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Kaelan Deese", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Corp.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X Corp."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Yaccarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Health", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CVS Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraint_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Restraint of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_O'Connor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reed O'Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy SEALs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

He infamously told advertisers that had left his platform to go \"fuck\" themselves in November.\n\nSince then, he's tried to woo advertisers back. It's not clear that'll work, Business Insider's Peter Kafka wrote last month.\n\nHis return to aggression against advertisers who want out is mirroring a push by Republican lawmakers to investigate Musk's advertising opponents.\n\nThe GOP-led House Judiciary Committee stepped up its investigation of GARM earlier this year, sending out subpoenas as part of an inquiry into allegations of anti-conservative bias.\n\nA spokesperson for the committee said in May: \"These companies know the evidence collected shows that members of GARM have worked for years to spread their personal biases and censor conservative voices and journalists online.\"\n\nSeveral people close to the companies, meanwhile, told BI's Lara O'Reilly that they were concerned the allegations and investigations would intensify during an election year.\n\nAnother advertising-industry veteran said the inquiries would have a \"chilling effect.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Members include major tech companies, advertisers, agencies, ad tech firms and advertising coalitions.\n\nZoom in: The lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, argues GARM \"conspired, along with dozens of non-defendant co-conspirators, to collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue from Twitter, Inc. (\"Twitter,\" now X Corp.).\"\n\nWhat they're saying: On Tuesday, X CEO Linda Yaccarino alleged in an open letter to advertisers that GARM's \"behavior is a stain on a great industry, and cannot be allowed to continue.\"\n\nThe big picture: The lawsuit is part of a broader effort by X to litigate its way through advertising challenges.\n\nState of play: Rumble on Tuesday said it would join X in its lawsuit against WFA, GARM's parent, but added that it would also be suing WPP and its subsidiary GroupM.\n\nBy the numbers: X's advertising business has taken a significant hit since Musk purchased it in 2022. The company is expecting to earn roughly $2 billion in advertising revenue this year, a source told Axios.\n\nWhat to watch: GARM is considered a helpful tool by many players in the ad industry, letting them hand off to a third party potentially controversial calls about the acceptability of particular advertising environments.\n\nLinda Yaccarino: Hey, everybody. I was shocked by the evidence uncovered by the House Judiciary Committee, that a group of companies organized a systematic, illegal boycott against X. It is just wrong, and that is why we are taking action.\n\nToday, we filed an Antitrust lawsuit against the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, four of its key members, and the World Federation of Advertisers.\n\nThese organizations targeted our company and you, our users. The evidence and facts are on our side. They conspired to boycott X, which threatens our ability to thrive in the future.\n\nThat puts your Global Town Square - the one place that you can express yourself, freely and openly - at long-term risk. People are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is constricted. No small group of people should be able to monopolize what gets monetized.\n\nThis group is no match for the power of our users, all of you, the very same users that have driven usage of X to all-time highs. I joined X because I believe in the power of the Global Town Square. It's users like you, people of all backgrounds and opinions, who make X indispensable.\n\nYou deserve an open platform, where your views can be expressed without restriction and without fear. To all of you who have been part of this transformative journey that we're on, thank you.

In the wake of the takeover, 18 GARM members stopped advertising on the platform altogether, according to the lawsuit. Dozens of others reduced their spending by 70 percent or more, the filing said.\n\nThe effects on X's revenue have been severe. In the second quarter of this year, X earned $114 million in revenue in the United States, a 25 percent decline from the first quarter and a 53 percent decline from the same period the previous year, according to internal documents obtained by The New York Times. The company aims to reach $190 million in US revenue during the third quarter, bolstered by advertising associated with the Olympics, football, and political campaigns, the documents said -- but that target would still set X's quarterly earnings at 25 percent less than they were last year.\n\nBecause of reduced advertiser spending, X was forced to drop the price of its ads, the lawsuit said. But even though its ads were inexpensive compared with other social media platforms, advertisers did not come back.\n\nIn the lawsuit, X argued that advertisers' refusal to return was anticompetitive. \"By refraining from purchasing advertising from X, boycotting advertisers are forgoing a valuable opportunity to purchase low-priced advertising inventory on a platform with brand safety that meets or exceeds industry standards,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nSeveral major brands left X or reduced their spending there after Musk restored hundreds of banned accounts and researchers documented a surge in hate speech and misinformation on the platform. To advertisers, the accusations in the lawsuit sound \"so far-fetched and frankly ridiculous,\" Schreurs said.\n\nAfter Musk's takeover, the company allowed its membership in GARM to lapse, but X recommitted to the coalition in July. \"X is committed to the safety of our global town square and proud to be part of the GARM community,\" the company said in a statement that month.\n\nIn July, the House Judiciary Committee, led by Representative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, released a report that said GARM had attempted to influence the kinds of content that appear online by \"starving disfavored content, or even entire platforms, of advertising dollars needed to survive.\" And last week, the committee expanded its inquiry into GARM's activities, sending letters to more than 40 member companies that asked them to preserve documents and answer questions about their relationship with the group.\n\nGARM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives for CVS, Unilever, Mars, and Orsted also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nRumble, a right-leaning video platform, also filed a lawsuit Tuesday against GARM and several advertising agencies that had recommended their clients refrain from advertising on the service. \"The brand safety standards set by advertisers and their ad agencies should succeed or fail in the marketplace on their own merits and not through the coercive exercise of market power,\" Rumble said in its complaint.\n\nMusk has long had a tempestuous relationship with X's advertisers. Last year at The New York Times DealBook Summit, he accused advertisers of trying to \"blackmail\" him by pulling their advertising from X after he endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory online. Musk told brands \"Don't advertise\" and used an expletive several times to emphasize his point.\n\nMusk singled out Bob Iger, chief executive of Disney, which was a major advertiser on X at the time. Iger had said the company's association with \"Elon Musk and X was not necessarily a positive one for us.\"\n\nIn June, Musk appeared onstage at Cannes Lions, an advertising festival, to say his comments at the DealBook conference had been addressed not to \"advertisers as a whole\" but just to those who attempted to interfere with what is allowed on X.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com",

These efforts have apparently failed, and Linda Yaccarino, the current CEO of X and a former advertising exec announced a new strategy to improve the company's advertising revenue: suing advertisers that may have plotted a boycott against the company.\n\nThe X CEO penned an open letter to advertisers on X today where she announced a class-action lawsuit against a couple of advertising organizations, as well as big companies like Mars and Unilever. She also published a short video explaining the situation where she can be seen wearing a \"Mama Free speech\" pendant.\n\nIn her open letter to advertisers, Yaccarino cited a recent report from the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee's revealing that the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) and its members \"directly organized boycotts and used other indirect tactics to target disfavored platforms, content creators, and news organizations in an effort to demonetize and, in effect, limit certain choices for consumers.\" According to the Yaccarino, X is one of the platforms impacted by this boycott, which cost the company \"billions of dollars.\"\n\n\"This behavior is a stain on a great industry, and cannot be allowed to continue,\" Yaccarino said. \"That is why, today, X has filed an antitrust lawsuit against the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), and GARM members CVS Health, Mars, Orsted and Unilever. This is not a decision we took lightly, but it is a direct consequence of their actions.\"\n\nOn X, Elon Musk added fuel to the fire and said \"We tried peace for 2 years, now it is war.\" In a follow-up message, the X owner added \"I strongly encourage any company who has been systematically boycotted by advertisers to file a lawsuit.\"\n\nIt's quite ironic, especially for a former advertising executive, to join Musk in his crusade against advertisers. The same Musk who recently said in an interview with CNBC that \"If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is.\"\n\nThere's little chance that X is going to win back advertisers by suing them and threatening any potential clients. Musk previously admitted that this ad boycott was \"going to kill the company,\" but he'll only have himself to blame if this is what ends up happening.", "source": {"uri": "thurrott.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Thurrott.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laurent_giret@thurrott.com", "name": "Laurent Giret", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Yaccarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Health", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CVS Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Federation_of_Advertisers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Federation of Advertisers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blackmail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thurrott-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/web/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/X-CEO-Linda-Yaccarino.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795231", "eventUri": "eng-9795231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

GARM used those one-size-fits-all standards to perpetrate an advertiser boycott against Rumble and other platforms. The suit also notes that GARM has vast reach since it counts the six largest ad agency holding companies among its members, including defendant WPP.\n\n\"The brand safety standards set by advertisers and their ad agencies should succeed or fail in the marketplace on their own merits and not through the coercive exercise of market power,\" Rumble's complaint reads. \"All of this illegal conduct is done at the expense of platforms, content creators, and their users, as well as the agencies' own advertiser clients who pay more for ads as a result of their collusion.\"\n\nThe unlawful conduct alleged by Rumble is also the subject of an ongoing investigation by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in Congress. An interim committee staff report issued in July found that the way GARM has operated in this regard \"is likely illegal under the antitrust laws and threatens fundamental American freedoms.\"\n\nRumble is seeking a declaration that the defendants' conduct is illegal, a permanent injunction against the continued conduct, damages, interest, and legal fees, among other relief.\n\nABOUT RUMBLE\n\nRumble is a high-growth video platform and cloud services provider that is creating an independent infrastructure.

Many corporations bailed when racist and antisemitic content seemed to explode on Twitter after Musk acquired it in the fall of 2022. They've remained wary, and Musk himself has amplified controversial posts. The suit doesn't say advertisers can't boycott, but that they can'y decide together to do it.\n\n\"Defendants conspired, along with dozens of non-defendant co-conspirators, to collectively withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue from Twitter [now X] ... Concerned that Twitter might deviate from certain brand safety standards for advertising on social media platforms set through GARM, the conspirators collectively acted to enforce Twitter's adherence to those standards through the boycott.\"\n\nGARM is the Global Alliance for Responsible Media.\n\n\"This is an antitrust action relating to a group boycott by competing advertisers of one of the most popular social media platforms in the United States,\" X's suit said. \"GARM's members \"did, abruptly and in lockstep, boycott Twitter by discontinuing entirely or substantially reducing their previously substantial advertising purchases,\" calling it a conspiracy and collusion.\n\nThe company is asking for a jury trial with \"trebeled\" compensatory damages as well as injunctive relief, saying there is still boycotting.\n\nX said its brand safety standards are comparable to those of its competitors and meet of exceed GARMs parameters, but also that each social media platform should be free to set its own brand safety standards. It believes that the \"free market would see platforms with inefficient standards lag behind.\"\n\nWhether or not you buy that, the issues \"collective action among competing advertisers to dictate brand safety standards to be applied by social media platforms.\"\n\n\"The brand safety standards set by GARM should succeed or fail in the marketplace on their own merits and not through the coercive exercise of market power by advertisers acting collectively to promote their own economic interests through commercial restraints at the expense of social media platforms and their users.\"\n\nThe issue is the subject of an active investigation by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee, which emboldened the suit by an interim report finding that \"The extent to which GARM has organized its trade association and coordinates actions that rob consumers of choices is likely illegal under the antitrust laws and threatens fundamental American freedoms.\"\n\nX described a major economic hit from the boycotts. \"X became a less effective competitor to other social media platforms in the sale of digital advertising and in competing for user engagement on its platform. By sharply curtailing its revenues, the boycott has reduced X's ability to invest in new or improved functionality, thus harming the consumers who use X's platform.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jill_goldsmith@deadline.com", "name": "Jill Goldsmith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brand safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziff_Davis", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ziff Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Pharmacy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CVS Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNET", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Group boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market power"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/elon-musk-3.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795231", "eventUri": "eng-9795231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

To share their content and see more. To debate and be debated. To entertain and be entertained. To inspire and be inspired. There is no substitute for X.\"\n\nYaccarino, who joined X as CEO in June 2023 after a career in media and advertising, cited the power of the X community to foster global conversations as a primary reason for her excitement in taking on her role. However, recent findings by the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee have exposed significant challenges. The report, titled \"GARM's (Global Alliance for Responsible Media) Harm,\" revealed evidence of an illegal boycott targeting X and other companies.\n\n\"The report disclosed that their investigation had found evidence of an illegal boycott against many companies, including X,\" Yaccarino explained. \"As their report found: 'Evidence obtained by the Committee shows that GARM and its members directly organized boycotts and used other indirect tactics to target disfavored platforms, content creators, and news organizations in an effort to demonetize and, in effect, limit certain choices for consumers.'\"\n\nYaccarino emphasized the detrimental impact of this boycott on X's users, ranging from sports fans and gamers to journalists and political leaders. \"To put it simply, people are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is undermined and some viewpoints are not funded over others as part of an illegal boycott. This behavior is a stain on a great industry, and cannot be allowed to continue.\"\n\nIn response, X has filed an antitrust lawsuit against GARM, the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), and GARM members CVS Health, Mars, Orsted, and Unilever. \"This is not a decision we took lightly, but it is a direct consequence of their actions. The illegal behavior of these organizations and their executives cost X billions of dollars,\" Yaccarino stated.\n\nDespite these challenges, Yaccarino highlighted X's resilience and growth. \"Since arriving at X, I made it my mission to continue to build a platform where people, brands, and advertisers can thrive in our unique, dynamic, and safe environment. And because of this commitment to our users, even despite the boycott, usage has reached all-time highs.\"\n\nCiting impressive statistics, Yaccarino noted, \"Using a Twitter legacy metric, user active minutes, in August 2022, people spent 7.2 billion active minutes on the platform. Today, that number is more than 9 billion, a 25% increase. The same is true for video - even compared to last year, daily video views are up 45% to 8.2 billion. X is innovating and growing.\"\n\nYaccarino reaffirmed X's commitment to providing advertisers with effective tools and a safe platform, stating, \"We have met and surpassed the requests made by advertisers and groups such as GARM for new tools, both to improve advertiser controls and the effectiveness of our products to drive increased value for our customers.\"\n\nHowever, she expressed disappointment that despite these efforts, many companies chose to ignore the facts and continue their boycott. \"To those who broke the law, we say enough is enough. We are compelled to seek justice for the harm that has been done by these and potentially additional defendants, depending on what the legal process reveals.\"\n\nElon Musk also commented on the situation via X, urging other companies to take legal action. \"I strongly encourage any company who has been systematically boycotted by advertisers to file a lawsuit. Rumble confirmed it has joined to sue a cartel of advertisers and ad agencies who conspired to block ad revenue from going to certain platforms and content creators. GARM was a conspiracy to perpetrate an advertiser boycott of Rumble and others, and that's illegal. There may also be criminal liability via the RICO Act,\" Musk stated.\n\nYaccarino concluded her letter with a message of determination and gratitude. \"We will continue to innovate and ensure X has a vibrant future while the courts hold accountable those who engaged in illegal behavior. To all of you who have been part of the transformative journey we are on, thank you. Rest assured, we will not stop defending our global town square.\"", "source": {"uri": "thezimbabwemail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Zimbabwe Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Yaccarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Health", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CVS Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Football_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's Football Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Federation_of_Advertisers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Federation of Advertisers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metric system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal liability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/X-and-Rumble-45.jpg?fit=900%2C508&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795231", "eventUri": "eng-9795231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nX Corp., the Elon Musk-owned tech company that owns X (formerly Twitter), is suing a group of advertisers, alleging the advertisers conspired to \"withhold billions of dollars in advertising revenue\" from the social media platform.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed today in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, as spotted by The New York Times, argues that the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), four of its members: CVS Health, Mars, Orsted, and Unilever, and the World Federation of Advertisers, accusing this coalition of advertisers for pausing advertisements on X after it was acquired by Musk in 2022.\n\n\"We tried peace for 2 years, now it is war,\" Musk wrote in a post published today on X/Twitter. X CEO Linda Yaccarino also published an open letter on X/Twitter, announcing the company's plan for legal action against these advertisers. Yaccarino cited the House Judiciary Committee's report on GARM and how the organization sought to control online speech.\n\nThe House Judiciary's report notes that evidence it obtained showed \"that GARM and its members directly organized boycotts and used other indirect tactics to target disfavored platforms, content creators, and news organizations in an effort to demonetize and, in effect, limit certain choices for consumers.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Yaccarino published a video explaining the company's decision to sue these advertisers for their alleged co-conspiring to withhold ads and ad revenue from X/Twitter. \"They conspire to boycott X, which threatens our ability to thrive in the future,\" explained in the video. \"That puts your global town square, the one place you can express yourself freely and openly at long-term risk. People are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is constricted.\"\n\nThis is not the first lawsuit X Corp. has filed over the issue of an advertiser exodus on X/Twitter as the company announced in November that it was suing the left-wing watchdog group Media Matters for America after it published a report about X placing ads from companies such as Apple and IBM in front of antisemitic content. That particular lawsuit argues that the nonprofit organization is legally liable for X/Twitter losing advertising revenue. In July 2023, X Corp filed a separate lawsuit against the research nonprofit group Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), claiming that the organization \"embarked on a scare campaign\" to drive away advertisers on X/Twitter.\n\nMusk's acquisition of X/Twitter has been polarizing since he acquired the social media platform. From the removal of checkmarks and paywalling them behind a subscription service to multiple reports and studies showing an increase in hate speech, and the laxed moderation policies are among the frequent criticisms of X/Twitter since Musk purchased the social media platform.\n\nTaylor is a Reporter at IGN.

The lawsuit alleges these organizations orchestrated an illegal boycott against X to undermine its platform and limit consumer choices.\n\n\"Every day, hundreds of millions of people come to X to be part of the only global, real-time conversation,\" Yaccarino wrote in an open letter to advertisers. \"The consequence -- perhaps the intent -- of this boycott was to seek to deprive X's users, be they sports fans, gamers, journalists, activists, parents or political and corporate leaders, of the Global Town Square.\"\n\nThe lawsuit comes in the wake of a report by the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, which revealed evidence of an organized boycott by GARM and its members. The committee's report stated, \"Evidence obtained by the Committee shows that GARM and its members directly organized boycotts and used other indirect tactics to target disfavored platforms, content creators, and news organizations in an effort to demonetize and, in effect, limit certain choices for consumers.\"\n\nYaccarino underscored the severity of these actions, noting that they have caused significant financial harm to X Corp. \"The illegal behavior of these organizations and their executives cost X billions of dollars,\" she stated.\n\nDespite the alleged boycott, X has continued to thrive.

Video engagement has also seen substantial growth, with daily video views up 45% year-over-year to 8.2 billion.\n\n\"We have met and surpassed the requests made by advertisers and groups such as GARM for new tools, both to improve advertiser controls and the effectiveness of our products to drive increased value for our customers,\" Yaccarino emphasized. \"We have proven our platform provides advertisers a way to showcase their brands and reach their target audiences safely, efficiently, and effectively.\"\n\nThe decision to file the lawsuit was not taken lightly. \"To those who broke the law, we say enough is enough,\" Yaccarino declared. \"We are compelled to seek justice for the harm that has been done by these and potentially additional defendants, depending on what the legal process reveals.\"\n\nThe lawsuit aims to hold these organizations accountable and address the broader implications of such actions. \"This case is about more than damages -- we have to fix a broken ecosystem that allows this illegal activity to occur,\" Yaccarino asserted.\n\nThe announcement has sparked a wave of reactions across social media. Tim Heaton commented, \"I can think of no more important legal battle than this, the battle between authoritarian, dystopian, information control vs the free and open dissemination of all thought and knowledge.\"\n\nDr. Manhattva added, \"I'm rooting for you, Linda. I honestly view this as a fight for civilization, and you simply must win.\"\n\nOthers expressed their support for X as a platform for free speech and real information. Finance with Michael remarked, \"It is great to take such a strong stand for free speech. X is the place where people go for real information. Facebook is now just a place for nonsense.\"\n\nYaccarino reiterated X's commitment to innovation and growth. \"We will continue to innovate and ensure X has a vibrant future while the courts hold accountable those who engaged in illegal behavior,\" she wrote. Despite the challenges, X remains a dynamic and growing platform, dedicated to providing a unique space for global conversations.\n\n\"To all of you who have been part of the transformative journey we are on, thank you. Rest assured, we will not stop defending our global town square,\" Yaccarino concluded.\n\nThe stakes are high as X Corp. embarks on this legal battle, but with strong community support and a steadfast commitment to its mission, the platform is poised to continue its path of growth and innovation.", "source": {"uri": "webpronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WebProNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rich_ord@webpronews.com", "name": "Rich Ord", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Corp.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "X Corp."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linda Yaccarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Health", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CVS Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Football_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's Football Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Federation_of_Advertisers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Federation of Advertisers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-06-at-12.42.56\u202fPM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795231", "eventUri": "eng-9795231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

X CEO Linda Yaccarino also published an open letter on X/Twitter, announcing the company's plan for legal action against these advertisers. Yaccarino cited the House Judiciary Committee's report on GARM and how the organization sought to control online speech.\n\nThe House Judiciary's report notes that evidence it obtained showed \"that GARM and its members directly organized boycotts and used other indirect tactics to target disfavored platforms, content creators, and news organizations in an effort to demonetize and, in effect, limit certain choices for consumers.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Yaccarino published a video explaining the company's decision to sue these advertisers for their alleged co-conspiring to withhold ads and ad revenue from X/Twitter. \"They conspire to boycott X, which threatens our ability to thrive in the future,\" explained in the video. \"That puts your global town square, the one place you can express yourself freely and openly at long-term risk. People are hurt when the marketplace of ideas is constricted.\"\n\nThis is not the first lawsuit X Corp. has filed over the issue of an advertiser exodus on X/Twitter as the company announced in November that it was suing the left-wing watchdog group Media Matters for America after it published a report about X placing ads from companies such as Apple and IBM in front of antisemitic content. That particular lawsuit argues that the nonprofit organization is legally liable for X/Twitter losing advertising revenue. In July 2023, X Corp filed a separate lawsuit against the research nonprofit group Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), claiming that the organization \"embarked on a scare campaign\" to drive away advertisers on X/Twitter.\n\nMusk's acquisition of X/Twitter has been polarizing since he acquired the social media platform. From the removal of checkmarks and paywalling them behind a subscription service to multiple reports and studies showing an increase in hate speech, and the laxed moderation policies are among the frequet criticisms of X/Twitter since Musk purchased the social media platform.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Corp.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X Corp."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Health", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CVS Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Yaccarino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linda Yaccarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Countering_Digital_Hate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center for Countering Digital Hate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Matters_for_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media Matters for America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paywall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/06/xtwitter-suffers-widespread-link-outage-but-appears-to-be-wo-pqfn-1722977787173.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795231", "eventUri": "eng-9795231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

NewsGuard and the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) have been criticized as the most sophisticated components of a modern blacklisting system targeting conservative or dissenting voices. I recently had a series of exchanges with NewsGuard after a critical column. Now, the House Judiciary Committee under Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is moving forward in demanding documents and records from leading companies utilizing the GARM system, a company that I have previously criticized. It is a welcomed effort for anyone who is concerned over the use of these blacklisting systems to curtail free speech. However, time is of the essence.\n\nThe demand to preserve evidence went to various companies, including Adidas, American Express, Bayer, BP, Carhartt, Chanel, CVS and General Motors.\n\nIn my new book, I discuss the rating systems as a new and insidious form of blacklisting.\n\nIt is an effort to strangle the financial life out of sites by targeting their donors and advertisers. This is where the left has excelled beyond anything that has come before in speech crackdowns.\n\nYears ago, I wrote about the Biden administration supporting efforts like the Global Disinformation Index (GDI) to discourage advertisers from supporting certain sites. All of the 10 riskiest sites targeted by the index were popular with conservatives, libertarians and independents. That included Reason.org and a group of libertarian and conservative law professors who simply write about cases and legal controversies. GDI warned advertisers against \"financially supporting disinformation online.\" At the same time, HuffPost, a far-left media outlet, was included among the 10 sites at lowest risk of spreading disinformation.\n\nOnce GDI's work and bias was disclosed, government officials quickly disavowed the funding. It was a familiar pattern. Within a few years, we found that the work had been shifted instead to groups like the GARM, which is the same thing on steroids. It is the creation of a powerful and largely unknown group called the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), which has huge sway over the advertising industry and was quickly used by liberal activists to silence opposing views and sites by cutting off their revenue streams.\n\nNotably, Rob Rakowitz, head of GARM, pushed GDI and embraced its work. In an email to GARM members obtained by the committee last month, Rakowitz wrote that he wanted to \"ensure you're working with an inclusion and exclusion list that is informed by trusted partners such as NewsGuard and GDI -- both partners to GARM and many of our members.\"\n\nGARM is being used by WFA to achieve what GDI failed to accomplish. The WFA sites refers to Rakowitz as \"a career change agent\" who will \"remove harmful content from ad-supported digital media.\"\n\nRakowitz's views on free speech are chilling and his work shows how these systems can be used to conceal bias in targeting the revenue of sites with opposing views.\n\nRakowitz has denounced the \"extreme global interpretation of the US Constitution\" and how civil libertarians cite \"'principles for governance' and applying them as literal law from 230 years ago (made by white men exclusively).\"\n\nHe appears to be referring to free speech. If so, it is deeply troubling. Some of us believe that free speech is a human right, not just an American right. Those \"white men\" include philosophers from the enlightenment whose ideas were incorporated in the Framer's view of inalienable rights like free speech.\n\nThe threat against free speech today is being led by private groups seeking to exercise an unprecedented level of control what people can read and discuss.\n\nPundits and politicians, including President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama, have justified their calls for censorship (or \"content moderation\" for polite company) by stressing that the First Amendment only applies to the government, not private companies. That distinction allows Obama to declare himself last week to be \"pretty close to a First Amendment absolutist.\" He did not call himself a \"free speech absolutist\" because he favors censorship for views that he considers to be \"lies,\" \"disinformation,\" or \"quackery.\"\n\nThe distinction has always been a disingenuous evasion. The First Amendment is not the sole or exclusive definition of free speech. Censorship on social media is equally, if not more, damaging for free speech. Those who value free speech should oppose blacklisting system, as was the case during the McCarthy period. Now that conservatives and libertarians are being blacklisted, it is suddenly less troubling for many on the left.\n\nRakowitz now wields massive influence over public discourse in this collaboration with corporations and groups like GDI. As was done to the left in during the McCarthy period, blacklisting systems are now being used to control public access to information by choking off the revenue of sites.\n\nThe current anti-free speech movement is the most dangerous in history due precisely to this sophistication and the unprecedented alliance of corporate, media, academic, and government interests.\n\nGARM and other media rating systems have been embraced by many who would prefer to silence opposing voices than respond to them. Rakowitz was wildly popular at Davos in calling for a \"safer\" Internet that would target dangerous sites much like GDI: \"GARM has been officially recognized as a key project for 2020 within the WEF's platform on Shaping the Future of Media Entertainment and Culture.\"\n\nThe House committees are pushing forward with a sense of urgency. It is clear that the investigations in government-supported censorship and these blacklisting operations will end if the Democrats retake the house. It is expected that these companies will seek to delay any disclosures in the hope that the House will switch hands and this system will again be allowed to recede back into the darkness.", "source":

GARM used those one-size-fits-all standards to perpetrate an advertiser boycott against Rumble and other platforms. The suit also notes that GARM has vast reach since it counts the six largest ad agency holding companies among its members, including defendant WPP.\n\n\"The brand safety standards set by advertisers and their ad agencies should succeed or fail in the marketplace on their own merits and not through the coercive exercise of market power,\" Rumble's complaint reads. \"All of this illegal conduct is done at the expense of platforms, content creators, and their users, as well as the agencies' own advertiser clients who pay more for ads as a result of their collusion.\"\n\nThe unlawful conduct alleged by Rumble is also the subject of an ongoing investigation by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in Congress.

The complaint, filed in the Northern District of Texas, accuses them of forming an advertising cartel that allegedly colluded to withhold advertising dollars from X Corp's social media platform to enforce compliance with certain brand safety standards.\n\nWe obtained a copy of the complaint for you here.\n\nAccording to the legal documents, this group, under the umbrella of the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), orchestrated a boycott impacting the revenue streams of X significantly, following its acquisition of Twitter. The collective action allegedly aimed at maintaining stringent content moderation standards, a move X Corp argues went beyond competitive or consumer interest to serve the cartel's shared economic goals.\n\n\"The boycott and its effects continue to this day,\" states the complaint, detailing how these actions have allegedly stifled competition and innovation in social media advertising. The complaint highlights internal communications within GARM celebrating the economic damage inflicted on X, which they claim fell \"80% below revenue forecasts\" due to the boycott.\n\nA focal point of the lawsuit is the alleged breach of the Sherman Act, asserting that the defendant's actions constitute an unlawful restraint of trade. \"In a competitive market, each social media platform would set its brand safety standards...but collective action among competing advertisers to dictate brand safety standards shortcuts the competitive process,\" the lawsuit contends.\n\nFurther exacerbating the issue, the House Judiciary Committee has taken an interest, with their investigation suggesting that the conduct of WFA and GARM \"threatens fundamental American freedoms\" and could be \"likely illegal under the antitrust laws.\"\n\nX Corp seeks not only compensatory damages but also injunctive relief to prevent future boycotts and ensure a fair competitive environment.\n\nRumble has also joined forces with X in filing a comprehensive antitrust lawsuit against the key players in the advertising industry.\n\nWe obtained a copy of the complaint for you here.\n\nGARM, with its cartel-like behavior, Rumble asserts, has orchestrated a boycott against it and similar platforms, unfairly cutting them off from vital advertising revenue streams.\n\n\"The brand safety standards set by advertisers and their ad agencies should succeed or fail in the marketplace on their own merits and not through the coercive exercise of market power,\" Rumble's complaint reads. \"All of this illegal conduct is done at the expense of platforms, content creators, and their users, as well as the agencies' own advertiser clients who pay more for ads as a result of their collusion.\"\n\nThe lawsuit elaborates on the detrimental impact of this alleged collusion, stressing that it not only harms digital platforms and content creators by strangling their primary revenue sources but also inflates advertising costs. Consequently, this leads to higher expenses for the agencies' own clients, spiraling into a broader negative impact on the digital advertising ecosystem.\n\nAdding a layer of gravity to their claims, both Rumble and X highlight ongoing investigations by the US House Judiciary Committee, which has expressed concerns that GARM's actions might violate antitrust laws and impinge on fundamental American freedoms. With this legal action, Rumble seeks not only financial redress but also a judicial affirmation that the defendants' actions are illegal, alongside a permanent injunction to halt these practices, signaling a critical juncture in the fight for fairness in digital advertising practices.", "source": {"uri": "reclaimthenet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reclaim The Net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cindy_harper@reclaimthenet.org", "name": "Cindy Harper", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brand safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Collective action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Health", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CVS Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Federation_of_Advertisers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Federation of Advertisers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00d8rsted_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00d8rsted (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sherman Antitrust Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "False imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market power"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/x-rumble-garm-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795231", "eventUri": "eng-9795231", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Stay ahead of the shifts impacting the media landscape and gain fresh strategies to drive platform growth. Save 20% on passes.\n\nX is back to warring with advertisers, and advertisers are back to executing caution when engaging with the platform, buyers told ADWEEK.\n\nTwo buy-side sources who have advertised on X this year said X's new lawsuit against the Global Alliance of Responsible Media, an advertising trade body, makes them reconsider future investment in the platform.\n\nX today filed a lawsuit against the Global Alliance of Responsible Media, the World Federation of Advertisers (of which GARM is a subsidiary), and GARM members CVS Health, Mars, Orsted and Unilever for using their influence to inspire brands to boycott X and depriving the platform of ad revenue. GARM is an industry organization that formed in 2019 to help brands avoid monetizing illegal or harmful content on digital media platforms.\n\nX owner Elon Musk said on the platform today, \"We tried peace for 2 years, now it's war,\" as he reposted CEO Linda Yaccarino's post about the lawsuit.\n\nThis is an about face from Musk's conciliatory presence at the Cannes Lions Festival earlier this summer, where he called brand safety \"critical,\" and said that \"advertisers have a right to appear next to content that they think fits with their brand.\"\n\nOne buy-side source, who is not authorized to speak with the media on the record, said a brand they work with had paused advertising on X last year after Musk made antisemitic comments in November but returned to the platform this year as the dust settled around that controversy.\n\n\"A lot of brands had kind of like slowly warmed back up,\" to advertising on X, the source said, noting incentives X has given to advertisers.\n\nToday's lawsuit could change that calculus.\n\n\"Every advertiser needs to stop and think very hard right now, and decide if, Twitter just doesn't fit a campaign, and [a brand is] not going to spend with them on this quarter or this initiative, is Elon going to just tell Linda Yaccarino to sue?\" the buyer said. \"Here's a guy ...who can fund any lawsuit forever.\"\n\nA major CPG brand who advertised on X around the Olympics said the lawsuit would make the brand reconsider whether to even post organically on X. Their paid activation has ended.\n\n\"Why would I want to be in any way, shape or form, involved in a place that wants to sue individual advertisers and the bodies that authentically represent them for choosing to not advertise there?\" the source said.\n\nX currently takes the most time for VaynerMedia employees to monitor for their clients out of every other platform, given the myriad controversies and drama on X, said Anthony Scarola, vp of media and programmatic lead at VaynerMedia. He said today's lawsuit is another example of the volatility of the platform, though noted the platform's reporting on brand safety has become more granular, and thus has flagged more brand safety issues as a result.\n\n\"We've definitely had those conversations as to, is the juice worth the squeeze?\" Scarola said.\n\nX's lawsuit comes on the heels of a report from republican members of the House of Representatives which found GARM limited choice for consumers by organizing to demonetize content it doesn't favor, specifically pointing to X and conservative creators and outlets, like Fox News and The Daily Wire.\n\nBut sources said there were many reasons brands chose to stop advertising on X, starting with Musk's takeover in 2022, that had nothing to do with politics or brand safety. Axios reported that X is supposed to make $2 billion in advertising revenue this year, compared to the $4.5 billion in revenue in 2021, the last full year X reported its earnings publicly.\n\nFirst, the most successful digital media companies like Meta and Google typically attract performance budgets, which are focused on linking advertising with sales. X has never been good at this and still isn't, the first buy-side source. \"It's never been about cost per acquisition,\" they said.\n\nPlus, at the time of Musk's takeover, brands had concerns about X's operational capacity that sparked reconsideration of ad spend, said Arielle Garcia, director of intelligence at industry watchdog Check My Ads, who served as chief privacy officer at ad buying giant UM Worldwide at the time of the Musk takeover.\n\n\"You had agency reps that were just kind of gone.

New FEMA rules aim to cut the red tape\n\nFEMA's NEW RULES TO MAKING GETTING HELP EASIER AND FASTER\n\nNew rules went into effect in March to help cut the red tape for people in need.\n\nHELP FOR HOMEOWNERS WITH NOT ENOUGH INSURANCE\n\nUnder previous rules, homeowners who had received payments from their insurance company for home repairs but not enough to cover all of the damage were essentially out of luck when it came to getting help from FEMA. Now those homeowners can apply to FEMA for help. Deanne Criswell, who heads FEMA, gave an example of a homeowner who has $80,000 in damage but receives only $45,000 from the insurance company. Previously, FEMA couldn't help them because their insurance payout already exceeded the agency's assistance cap of $42,500 per disaster. Now, that homeowner can get money from the agency to make up the difference.\n\nGETTING RID OF THE LOAN RULE\n\nUnder previous rules, disaster survivors first had to apply for a loan with the Small Business Administration and get rejected before they could apply for FEMA assistance. Criswell said survivors found the SBA application requirement \"confusing and challenging,\" so the agency is eliminating that requirement.\n\nCHANGES TO CRITICAL NEEDS ASSISTANCE\n\nThe agency has had something called critical needs assistance, currently $750, that survivors can use for whatever they need right after a disaster: baby formula or food, for example. But states or tribal nations had to specifically request that category of assistance, and it was only done on a case-by-case basis. Now, anytime a disaster is declared that includes FEMA's individual assistance funding stream, those $750 payments will be available. Survivors still have to apply, and there is some vetting to prevent fraud. But it bypasses the application that states and tribal nations had to make. That doesn't mean that every disaster will include these payments. Many declared disasters are more limited in scope.\n\nOTHER CHANGES\n\nDisaster survivors with disabilities can use FEMA money to make changes to their homes that make them more accessible. Under previous rules the agency would only pay to rebuild things damaged in the disaster. People with pre-existing problems in their home, like a leaky roof, can now get money from the agency to fix the house.\n\nAnd FEMA is creating a new category of aid called displacement assistance, designed to help those who can't return to their home. It gives them money for housing while they're looking for a long-term rental and has flexibility so that they can, for example, use the money to pay a friend's utilities if they're crashing on a couch.\n\nStay informed with KPRC 2's Breaking News Alerts\n\nEmail AddressBreaking News Alerts", "source": {"uri": "click2houston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPRC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karen_araiza@click2houston.com", "name": "Karen Araiza", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Flood_Insurance_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Flood Insurance Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Harvey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Harvey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Small Business Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conroe,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conroe, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Conroe, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_tape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red tape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deanne_Criswell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deanne Criswell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPRC-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KPRC-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/3XLM2OPBIFAPDABWTSAO3XZGUA.jpg?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551013", "eventUri": "eng-9551013", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Sanders, Welch, and Balint also highlighted areas where FEMA assistance has fallen short for Vermonters, including inadequate direct housing assistance, an unclear application process, and insufficient technical assistance for impacted Vermonters seeking aid.\n\nTo help Congress and FEMA improve its future disaster response, the Delegation today requested answers to several questions - accompanied by a staff briefing - no later than May 29, 2024.\n\nRead the full letter below or here:\n\nDear Administrator Criswell:\n\nWe appreciate the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) continued efforts to respond to the catastrophic July 2023 flooding in Vermont. We write to request information regarding potential improvements to FEMA's provision of Individual Assistance (IA) to affected communities.\n\nAs you know, in July 2023, severe flooding caused significant damage to cities and towns across Vermont, leading President Biden to issue a Major Disaster Declaration on July 14, 2023. Support from FEMA -- including IA -- has been crucial to the state's recovery efforts: among other aid, FEMA has provided over $25 million in individual and household assistance to over 3,600 households. We sincerely appreciate FEMA's efforts to work with state, local, and other officials to help Vermont rebuild.\n\nVermont's experience recovering from the July 2023 floods, however, also highlighted areas of improvement for FEMA's IA process. For example:\n\nInadequate Direct Housing Assistance. Following the flooding, FEMA worked in coordination with state officials to ultimately provide more than $23 million to Vermonters in housing assistance through the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). However, just 11 households in the state ultimately received Direct Housing Assistance, and many Vermonters struggled to access the assistance they needed. FEMA's process for providing Manufactured Housing United (MHUs), in particular, was poorly communicated and implemented. Initially, FEMA committed to siting about 20 MHUs in Montpelier, one of the hardest hit flood communities. Shortly before the planned siting, however, FEMA announced it would be exploring \"alternative options\" to relocating those residents, rather than placing them in MHUs. State officials and the congressional delegation were not informed in advance. Ultimately, FEMA only delivered five MHUs across the entire state. One of the residents being moved was not able to access the MHU until December -- three months after the MHU was delivered and five months after the flood. Caseworkers in our offices worked with families who were still in unsafe, severely damaged housing six months after the flood.\n\nUnclear application process. FEMA updated the format of its IA determination letters in 2022, following a 2020 report by the Government Accountability Office which found that the determination letters were a barrier to disaster survivors accessing assistance and did not comply with federal communication guidelines. Reports received from our constituents suggest that, despite FEMA's efforts, the IA determination process continues to be confusing for disaster survivors. In some cases, constituents reported not knowing whether they were being asked for additional information or that they could appeal an initial determination. In other cases, constituents reported submitting an application to FEMA on multiple occasions before the application was finally accepted. This lack of clarity created a barrier to Vermonters seeking assistance after the flooding -- particularly low-income families who often have less time and resources to devote to working through the bureaucratic process.\n\nInsufficient technical assistance. Though Vermont, working with FEMA, ultimately applied for, and received federal funding to support technical assistance through Disaster Case Management (DCM), it took over three months for the state's application to be approved so that it could begin setting up the DCM program. As a result, Vermonters relied on volunteer organizations across the state in addition to -- and in some cases in lieu of -- federally- and state-funded resources. Constituents reported receiving inconsistent information from FEMA staff at the national call center, local disaster recovery centers, and a field representative.\n\nWe appreciate that FEMA has taken steps to improve its IA program. For example, FEMA recently released the Interim Final Rule \"Individual Assistance Program Equity,\" an effort to better support disaster survivors by expanding eligibility for housing assistance and simplifying the application process. FEMA has also recently implemented changes to the IA program for Presidentially Declared Disasters on or after March 2024.\n\nTo help us better understand the steps that FEMA and Congress can take to further improve disaster response, and to ensure FEMA addresses the challenges faced by our constituents, we request answers to the following questions -- accompanied by a staff briefing -- no later than May 29, 2024:\n\nWith respect to Immediate Disaster Case Management (IDCM) and Disaster Case Management (DCM) assistance:\n\nPlease describe the needs required for states to receive Immediate Disaster Case Management (IDCM).\n\nHow many communities with Presidential Declared Natural Disasters were granted IDCM in 2023?\n\nWhat barriers, if any, does FEMA face in distributing DCM funding in a timely manner following disasters?\n\nWhat process changes, if any, could FEMA consider to make it easier for state, local, and volunteer-run organizations providing technical assistance and case management services to access funds?\n\nWhat steps, if any, should Congress consider to better streamline the provision of case management funding?\n\nWith respect to Direct Housing Assistance:\n\nWhat challenges, if any, does FEMA face in housing disaster victims under the Direct Housing Assistance program in a timely manner?\n\nWhat metrics does FEMA use to determine whether Direct Housing Assistance is needed following a disaster, and in what timeframe is that determination made?\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, immediately prior to the flooding, the rental vacancy rate in Vermont, as determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was just 1.8 percent. What steps, if any, could FEMA take to expedite providing housing for those with housing damage to ensure that victims are not living in damaged homes?\n\nWith respect to IA determination letters:\n\nPlease provide examples of determination letters sent to Vermonters in 2023, including determination letters that include final denials of IA assistance and determination letters that inform individuals they can appeal their determination.\n\nWhat steps is FEMA taking to improve the clarity and efficacy of its mailed correspondence surrounding IA determinations, including any efforts to solicit and implement survivor feedback?\n\nHow often does FEMA update its determination letter process to ensure applicants are aware of appeal options?\n\nWhat is FEMA doing to ensure survivors do not have to submit multiple applications for the same benefits?\n\nWith respect to FEMA's new streamlined process for the Individuals and Households Programs (IHP), what is the national denial rate for IA applications before the IHP process updates and what does FEMA project the denial rate for IA applications will be under the new process?\n\nWhat improvements could FEMA make to ensure survivors are receiving consistent and accurate information, provided across disparate outlets, such as the national call center, local recovery centers, and field representatives?\n\nSincerely,\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders Senator Peter Welch Representative Becca Balint", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title":

FEMA may actually already have many of the documents it requested from the communities, and the communities seem to have misunderstood the terminology FEMA staffers used to request certain documents.\n\nREAD MORE: FEMA raising flood insurance rates in Southwest Florida, blames bad Hurricane Ian rebuild\n\nThe result, so far, has been a handful of 30-day extensions before FEMA makes its final call on whether the communities get to keep their flood insurance discounts.

Lee County, Estero, Cape Coral, Bonita Springs and Fort Myers Beach all have until June 10 to submit all requested documents.\n\nDave Harner, Lee County's manager, told the Herald that weekly meetings between FEMA representatives and the five communities have helped everyone understand the issues and work together to solve them.\n\n\"FEMA said that may have been a gap that happened and now we're rectifying that gap through the meetings we're having,\" he said. \"We ultimately believe we have the documentation.\"\n\nFEMA also provided extra staff to help Lee County find and share the documents the agency asked for, which Harner cited as one of the major problems that may have led to the mix-up in the first place.\n\n\"The big issue is you're dealing with the third biggest storm in the country's history and you're dealing with a massive manpower issue,\" he said. \"We need upwards of 600 people to do an evaluation across the county. We don't have that, the state didn't have that.\"\n\nLee County has a list of 414 properties that FEMA had questions about; Cape Coral has 207; Bonita Springs has 106; Fort Myers Beach has 105.\n\nThe other communities in FEMA's crosshairs said they were \"working hard\" to comply with all the agency's requests ahead of the deadline. However, none of the other communities would confirm whether or not they thought they could retain their flood insurance discounts.\n\n\"It's not appropriate for me to speculate on FEMA's decision,\" wrote Melissa Mickey, spokesperson for the city of Cape Coral.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_harris@miamiherald.com", "name": "Alex Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Florida"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Ian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Ian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lee County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lee County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Myers_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Myers Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Myers Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estero,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Estero, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Estero, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonita_Springs,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bonita Springs, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bonita Springs, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Coral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cape Coral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Coral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Communication", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Communication", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Safety_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Safety and Security", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Intentional_Communities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Intentional Communities", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/seqtsx/picture275450696/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MIA_Ian_Day_3_Venice_MJO_53.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551013", "eventUri": "eng-9551013", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-01", "textStart": 1427, "textEnd": 1433}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 1590, "textEnd": 1597}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The declaration was made for multiple counties that experienced damage caused by storms in late July and August 2023. During that time, storms brought strong winds and heavy rain that caused significant flooding, in addition to seven tornadoes.\n\nThe approval of the disaster declaration request means Michigan residents affected by those storms now have access to assistance through the federal government. The deadline for residents and business owners to apply for this assistance was April 8, 2024, though that date was extended to May 8.\n\nWednesday is the deadline to request assistance. Here's how that process works.\n\nWhat assistance is available?\n\nHome owners and business owners who experienced damages or other issues related to the August storms and flooding are eligible to apply for assistance. The assistance comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA for short.\n\nHowever, the exact type of assistance available varies depending on the needs of the person, family or business.\n\nFor some, assistance from FEMA may come in the form of grants for temporary housing or home repairs. FEMA could also offer low-cost loans to \"cover uninsured property losses,\" officials said.\n\nThe FEMA assistance is meant to help people and businesses recover from the effects of the storms.\n\nTo see what kind of assistance you may qualify for, you'll have to submit an application with the federal government online, by phone, or on the FEMA app.\n\nWho's eligible for assistance?\n\nThe disaster declaration was approved for the following counties:\n\nEatonInghamIoniaKentLivingstonMacombMonroeOaklandWayne\n\nResidents and business owners in those counties can apply for assistance.

Those companies oversee 1,335 direct leases with Maui property owners to house people who lost their homes in the Aug. 8 fire in Lahaina.\n\nEach month, FEMA is writing checks to North Carolina-based Aesthetic Home Investments, California-based Lima Charlie and Florida-based Fedcology/Parliament to cover the costs of all the properties participating in the program, regardless of whether anyone is living in them, according to FEMA officials. Those companies keep a percentage of the money in fees and other costs and then in turn pay the property owners who are leasing their homes out, generally under one-year contracts.\n\nFEMA officials would not provide a breakdown of how the money is being spent or how much has been paid to date.

(Cammy Clark/Civil Beat/2024)\n\nAs of last week, fire survivors had moved into 835 of the 1,335 units the agency has leased directly from property owners, Curtis Brown, FEMA's deputy federal coordinating officer, said in an interview with Civil Beat.\n\nThat left 500 vacant units at that time that FEMA was paying for. Brown has said at public Lahaina recovery update meetings for the past few months that people are still getting paid for empty units.\n\nData posted on the federal website usaspending.gov indicates total costs including rent, property management fees, utilities, maintenance and other expenses average more than $12,000 per month per unit.\n\nOne of the contracts with Lima Charlie, for instance, shows FEMA has paid the company $59,000 since January. The agency has committed to pay up to $420,000 through next January, according to the federal data. But it's unclear how many properties that includes, where they are located or if anyone lives in them yet because FEMA would not provide the individual contracts.\n\nFederal data online shows one of the numerous contracts FEMA has awarded Lima Charlie to house Maui fire survivors through its direct-lease program. (USASpending.gov/2024)\n\nWith 500 or so vacant units as of last week, FEMA would have spent more than $5 million on empty housing in April alone.\n\nThere were roughly 600 vacant units one month ago being paid for by FEMA as the agency tried to quicken its pace. And most of the vacancies date to January or February when the majority of the contracts were signed, the point at which the payments begin.\n\nThe program started in November as an interim solution to move thousands of fire survivors out of pricey and cramped hotel rooms and into longer-term, more comfortable homes with kitchens. Property owners signed up for the relatively lucrative deal, but it was still a challenge to get people to move into the units -- largely because most are outside of West Maui, away from jobs, schools, doctors and their community.\n\nFEMA officials, property managers, fire survivors and others say it has taken months to successfully match survivors with units.\n\nIn addition to location issues, overly strict federal regulations governing living arrangements have been a problem. In some cases, larger families have been required to have units with more bedrooms even though they would accept smaller places. Some people have been unable to pass background checks or had problems getting them.\n\nRoughly 13,000 people were displaced by the Aug. 8 fires in Lahaina and Upcountry Maui. Nearly 1,600 are still living in hotels set up as emergency shelters while hundreds of other households have moved into FEMA's direct-lease units. (Nathan Eagle/Civil Beat/2023)\n\nFEMA would not provide the individual contracts with the companies, but Bob Fenton, who has been leading FEMA's Maui fire recovery efforts since August, told Civil Beat last month that property owners in the program were being paid an average of $6,000 per month.\n\nBut without the contracts, it's impossible to tell how much is going to the property owner versus the management company and other costs.\n\nLocal property managers say the average monthly rate for property management of long-term leases on Maui is 10% to 15%, with a higher first month rate for setting up the account, conducting background checks and inspections.\n\n\"Obviously, anything with government has additional costs; we have to meet certain protections,\" Fenton said when asked why FEMA was paying so much more than the going rate for property management.\n\nFEMA would not provide a breakdown of the number of units managed by each company, but according to federal data, the agency has committed to pay Lima Charlie $128.3 million, Fedcology/Parliament $46.9 million and Aesthetic Home Investments $23.7 million for a total of $198.87 million. That figure fluctuates day to day based on how many property owners are contracted, as some have dropped out of the program and new ones have been added.\n\nCurtis Brown, FEMA's deputy federal coordinating officer, says of about 1,300 units contracted with the direct-lease program, about 500 were still sitting empty as of this week. (Kevin Fujii/Civil Beat/2024)\n\nDavid Greenburg, who heads Fedcology/Parliament, and David Waldbauer, president of Lima Charlie, did not respond to repeated calls and emails. Iesha Carmichael, president of Aesthetic Home Investments, declined an interview request.\n\nR. Austin Oyler, an attorney representing Aesthetic's president, said in an email last month that \"AHI processed over 180 units in the prior three months, which it believes to be a tremendous result.\"\n\nAll three companies provided property owners a list of requirements to make sure their unit could pass a FEMA inspection -- including changing out double beds for single beds in some rooms, providing a specific type of fire extinguisher and installing smoke alarms. Several property owners said they took care of these requirements themselves before a lease was signed.\n\nAn owner of a two-bedroom, 1.5-bath home on South Kihei Road received two rent payments of approximately $9,000 each while the property was sitting empty. Fire survivors have since moved in, the owner said. The owner asked not to be named for this story.\n\nWith about 13,000 people losing their homes in the fires on Maui, which already was experiencing a housing crisis, the direct-lease program was set up to convert short-term rentals into long-term housing fire survivors for at least a year, and possibly up to two years, while new housing projects are built in Lahaina and elsewhere on Maui.\n\nCounty, state and federal officials have said for months that the biggest reason many units have sat empty is the challenge of getting fire survivors to move away from West Maui.\n\nGov. Josh Green said last week at a press conference about housing that some people have turned down matches \"four, five, six times.\"\n\nFrom left, Maui Mayor Richard Bissen listens to Gov. Josh Green as an ASL interpreter relays a message from FEMA's Bob Fenton during a press conference in October in Wailuku. The state will have to pick up the tab for housing fire survivors in hotels after Friday unless FEMA again extends the deadline. (Kevin Fujii/Civil Beat/2023)\n\nIn an effort to more quickly move survivors out of the resorts, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency on March 14 announced a policy that limits the number of times survivors can turn down federal or state-provided housing options and still remain in the emergency temporary program.\n\n\"We're just at a point now where more people are engaged in filling out the paperwork,\" Fenton said. \"We have the units. It's a matter of them completing the background checks. It's a matter of matching people up. It's a matter of them being responsive.\"\n\nThe direct-lease program also has had difficulty securing enough units that could accommodate pets and people with disabilities.\n\nBrown, of FEMA, said the process is now being expedited by having all three property management companies use the same background checks and a \"deeper communication with the survivor.\"\n\nHe said about 27 households per day are now being moved into a direct lease home.\n\nPeople like Joy Newman, a 71-year-old with medical problems whose Lahaina apartment was destroyed in the Aug. 8 fire, have appreciated what the program offers. She said she had tried to find a place on her own, but after a fruitless search, she gave up and went through the FEMA process for a direct lease.\n\nIt took months, but finally two weeks ago, Newman, who uses a walker and had recently undergone surgery for cancer, was matched with a unit in West Maui that could accommodate her needs and her Chihuahua named Malia. The unit had been sitting empty for a couple of months.\n\nFire survivor Joy Newman, 71, and her dog Malia were happy to move out of a resort hotel and into a condo in West Maui through FEMA's direct-lease program. (Cammy Clark/Civil Beat/2024)\n\nWhile Newman wishes it had happened sooner, she said it has been a relief to move out of the hotel room at the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa, her sixth lodging since the fire, and into a condo along the beach with turtles.\n\n\"Oh my heavens,\" she said. \"I can cook the food I can eat. With my rheumatoid arthritis, there's so many things I can't have. This is making a huge difference in how I feel. And my dog is finally settling in.\"\n\nIt almost didn't happen because FEMA personnel were concerned about Newman having to negotiate three stairs into the condo. But Newman said she convinced them she could handle it.\n\nAnd while she is planning to have her bed moved into the living room because the wind and street noise in the bedroom make it difficult to sleep, she said everything else is wonderful.\n\n\"It's not the perfect system, but it's a system we've been able to make work,\" Fenton said.\n\nMeanwhile, FEMA is also funding approximately 135 households still living in the resorts through its temporary emergency housing program that it contracted with the state and is being run by the American Red Cross. The program was at one point costing an estimated $1,000 per day per household, but likely is less now that the survivors are being provided two less meals per day.\n\nGreen said last week that the state thinks the remaining households eligible for the FEMA program living in the hotels is closer to 400 and is continuing to discuss this with FEMA. For months, the state has been paying for the households who are not eligible for FEMA housing.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there were 629 households representing 1,596 people and 149 pets living in the hotel program at seven locations. Friday is the deadline for FEMA to stop reimbursing the state for its eligible households in this program.\n\nFEMA has extended the deadline several times, but it has not said if it will do so again, which would leave the state to pick up the tab while it tries to find homes for those still staying in the hotels.\n\nGreen has said he expects to have almost everyone out of the hotels by July 1.",

Those companies oversee 1,335 direct leases with Maui property owners to house people who lost their homes in the Aug. 8 fire in Lahaina.\n\nEach month, FEMA is writing checks to North Carolina-based Aesthetic Home Investments, California-based Lima Charlie and Florida-based Fedcology/Parliament to cover the costs of all the properties participating in the program, regardless of whether anyone is living in them, according to FEMA officials.

The funding is available through the fiscal year 2023 Swift Current funding opportunity, made possible by President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\n\"Thanks to President Biden's Investing in America agenda we were able to extend additional funding to help flood-prone communities as they continue to grapple with the climate crisis,\" said Administrator Criswell. \"Michigan and Washington now join the 16 states and Tribal Nation we announced in April that will receive faster access to these valuable flooding mitigation grants. FEMA is looking forward to working with these states to ensure they take advantage of this new funding opportunity as they build resilience to future flood threats.\"\n\nThis announcement complements the April 17 announcement of 16 states and one Tribal Nation being eligible for up to $295 million for the same funding opportunity.\n\nSwift Current is designed to get funding on the ground as soon as possible after a flood-related disaster to help communities implement upgrades to reduce their flood risk. This funding will support National Flood Insurance Program policyholders who have experienced repetitive and substantial flood-damage. Each of the states and Tribe selected declared a flood-related major disaster since June 2023.\n\nThe opportunity aligns with FEMA's Year of Resilience and helps communities build local capacity to withstand tomorrow's hazards from climate change.\n\nThis announcement advances the President's Justice40 Initiative, which set a goal to deliver 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments to disadvantaged communities that have been marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution. Swift Current provides more equitable access to mitigation grants by increasing the federal cost share for eligible applicants above the standard 75% cost share and offering tailored pre-application support to disadvantaged communities that often face challenges meeting their non-federal match.\n\nExamples of projects eligible for this funding opportunity include property acquisition, demolition, elevation and relocation. To be eligible, buildings must be insured through the National Flood Insurance Program.\n\nThe following have been selected for funding:\n\nFor more information about the selections visit FEMA.gov. FEMA will distribute funding on a rolling basis as eligible applicants submit applications until the total available funding amount of $300 million is exhausted.\n\nThe applicant must meet the Swift Current activation criteria, including having a major disaster declaration for a flood-related disaster event beginning June 1, 2023, through May 31, 2024. A flood-related disaster event includes coastal storms, hurricanes, remnants of hurricanes and floods. Additional criteria may be found on FEMA.gov.\n\nThe application period for this opportunity opened Nov. 15, 2023. All eligible applicants must submit their fiscal year 2023 Swift Current grant applications to FEMA via MT eGrants. Upon Swift Current activation, FEMA will provide the application deadline to the applicant.\n\nThe application deadlines are for the applicants only. Local governments should consult with their state, tribal or territorial agency to confirm deadlines to submit subapplications for their consideration.\n\nFEMA will work with states, tribes and territories to explore their participation during this cycle of funding. Potential applicants who have questions may contact their FEMA regional office while interested subapplicants should contact their state or territory hazard mitigation officer.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Current", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swift Current"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Swift Current"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deanne_Criswell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deanne Criswell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Flood_Insurance_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Flood Insurance Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States of Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551013", "eventUri": "eng-9551013", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 1186, "textEnd": 1194}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-11-", "textStart": 3302, "textEnd": 3309}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Some of the kinds of projects that can be funded with the money include property acquisition, demolition, elevation and relocation.\n\nThe states and the tribe selected have each declared a flood-related major disaster since June 2023.\n\nSevere storms starting Aug. 24 hit Lower Michigan last year, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without power, destroying trees and walloping parts of western Wayne County with rain and flooding. In February, President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for nine counties affected by the storms.\n\nCalifornia, Florida, Colorado and the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians are some other examples of entities that are eligible for the Swift Current funding opportunity. The application period for the opportunity opened Nov. 15, 2023.

He also said a report that claimed resources were diverted from Trump to Jill Biden is \"very wrong\" and that the agency did not divert resources away from Trump.\n\nJordan also detailed other questions he expects the panel's members to ask Wray in the hearing, including why the rooftop of the building that the shooter accessed was unsecured and what coordination there was between various agencies ahead of the rally.\n\nWray and Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle briefed members of the House and Senate in two calls Wednesday.\n\nSenators were told that the 20-year-old suspected shooter -- who left Trump with an injured ear and one rally attendee dead -- had been flagged as suspicious by the Secret Service more than an hour before he fired.\n\nA classified briefing for House members is in the works for next week, according to a source familiar with the plans.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is also promising a bipartisan task force with subpoena authority to investigate the assassination attempt.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

However, the agency failed in its mission to protect Trump because it allowed a man with a rifle to climb atop a building less than 450 feet away with a direct line of sight of the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks, 20, set up on that building while Trump was appearing at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and fired several shots, officials said. Trump was bloodied, taking a grazing hit to his ear and cheek. A local man was killed and at least two people were seriously injured. Crooks was later killed by the USSS.\n\nShortly before Crooks fired, rallygoers noticed a man climbing on the roof and warned local police, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. The building is owned by American Glass Research, according to The Washington Post.\n\nA local police officer \"climbed to the roof and encountered Crooks, who pointed his rifle at the officer,\" the AP reported. \"The officer retreated down the ladder, and Crooks quickly took a shot toward Trump, and that's when Secret Service snipers shot him.\"\n\nThe USSS agents in Trump's personal protection detail (PDD) should be lauded \"because they threw their bodies on him as human shields until they heard the bad guy was neutralized,\" the former agent said. \"Secret Service pre-coordination failed. The PDD relies on the local USSS to have their shit in place.\"\n\nTrump was whisked away after the firing stopped.\n\nThe main question is why the roof was left unprotected to begin with said the former agent, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details. The agent has no direct knowledge of events but is speaking from past experience protecting a president and other VIPs.\n\n\"The biggest question I would ask is why the high points were not manned,\" the former agent wondered. \"I was on a rooftop with task force agents on the USF campus in 2012 during the Republican primaries. And that was just a primary debate among the Republicans. So why that rooftop was not manned by a team kinda baffles me.\"\n\nIt is especially puzzling considering how close the rooftop was to where Trump was standing.\n\n\"I can't imagine why they wouldn't want that rooftop so close to the venue. Even from the perspective of owning it so that could have an observation point.\"\n\nThe New York Post graphic below provides the scope of the scene.\n\nState or local law enforcement officers would have been the ones most likely to have patrolled the rooftop where Crooks perched himself because it was outside the Secret Service security perimeter for the rally, the former agent told us. However, the onus \"without a doubt\" lies on the USSS to ensure that the building was covered, the ex-federal agent said.\n\n\"That doesn't mean [USSS] had to man it,\" the former agent continued, \"but they definitely were responsible for coordinating coverage by state, local, or another federal agency to assist if they didn't have the manpower in-house.\"\n\n\"Especially outside the zone if there is a direct line of sight,\" the former agent told us. \"On initial notification, we examine every potential and I've been on more rooftops and highrises that even covered motorcade arrivals and departures near the venue.\"\n\nAn image of police reaching the body of shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks on the rooftop is seen below.\n\nSecuring high-elevation locations outside a security perimeter is true for sitting presidents and candidates alike, the ex-FBI agent said.\n\n\"USSS were impressive but must have been stretched thin,\" the former agent postulated. \"I've done those with USSS when [then-President Bill] Clinton visited Seattle\" for a World Trade Organization (WTO) event in 1999. \"And even during the Republican National Convention in 2012 for [candidates Mitt] Romney and [Paul] Ryan. They always snatch the high rooftops around the venue. And I was with them when they did.\"\n\nCoordination is \"tough\" in these circumstances, said the former agent, who recalled that during Cllnton's visit to Seattle as the WTO protests unfolded in 1999, agents narrowly averted a friendly fire tragedy.\n\n\"Seattle PD and King County Sheriff deputies were in an observation post during WTO in a high-rise adjacent residential building,\" the former agent said. \"With their tags around their neck. Calling in protester movements to the Joint Operations Center (JOC).\"\n\nAs they were calling out violent demonstrators' movement, \"USSS kicked in their door with weapons drawn on the two detectives at their assigned location. That was a failure of the counter-assault team and PPD to work with local USSS coordinating intel. The USSS snipers saw two guys with radios looking out a non-opening window and thought they were a threat to Clinton.\"\n\nThe veteran FBI agent posited that some of the problems Saturday could have been caused by \"a higher level resource allocation issue and that the ground agents had to make the best of what they had. I can't believe there wasn't even a local or state law enforcement officer at least requested to be on that roof.\"\n\n\"It's a bad breach of security,\" he concluded.\n\nIn a Tweet on Sunday, USSS spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied any accusation that additional resources requested by Trump's team were not provided.\n\n\"There's an untrue assertion that a member of the former President's team requested additional security resources & that those were rebuffed,\" stated Guglielmi. \"This is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources & technology & capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.\"\n\nThe War Zone reached out to USSS, the FBI which is now investigating the situation, the Pennsylvania State Police (PASP) who are investigating the murder of bystander Corey Comperatore. and the Butler County Sheriff's Office (BCSO) for more details. A man answering the phone at the PASP local office deferred questions to USSS and FBI. The FBI deferred us to the USSS, which did not return our message by deadline.\n\nIn a short speech from the Roosevelt Room at the White House Sunday afternoon President Joe Biden said Trump \"as a former president and nominee of the Republican Party already receives a heightened level of security. And I've been consistent in my direction of the Secret Service to provide him with every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure his continued safety.\"\n\nBiden also \"directed the head of the Secret Service to review all the security measures for the Republican National Convention which is scheduled to start tomorrow\" in Milwaukee. In addition, he has \"directed an independent review of the national security at yesterday's rally to assess exactly what happened. And we will share the results of that independent review with the American people as well.\"\n\nBiden's call for an investigation into what happened in Butler follows one by the Justice Department and the House of Representatives.\n\nWith several investigations underway, we should know more in the coming days and weeks about what failed and why.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

The USSS Special Agent in Charge Tim Burke reportedly told law enforcement partners that the USSS had limited resources that week because the agency was covering the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Washington, D.C. FBI personnel were present at those briefings. While the Committee recognizes that the FBI is one of many agencies represented in the WPFC, it is the lead federal investigative arm and a key source of intelligence on potential threats for special events in its area of responsibility.\n\nWhile it seems like it was a lifetime ago, the NATO Summit took place in D.C. from July 9 to July 11. Remember: President Joe Biden's \"Big Boy presser\" was just a week ago at the close of the summit.\n\nIf the information from the whistleblowers is accurate, the Secret Service knew ahead of time that it was stretched thin due to the summit, knew that there were competing events involving the first lady and former president requiring stepped-up security, and the FBI was aware of the understaffing. Yet, in spite of recent intelligence assessments regarding a plot to assassinate Trump, they just sort of shrugged and went ahead with the events.\n\nREPORT: US Intelligence Was Warned About an Iranian Plot to Assassinate Trump\n\nAt this point, there's no indication that the shooter was acting in concert with or at the behest of others, and his motives remain opaque. But he was just a 20-year-old kid, and he managed to kill a 50-year-old husband and father, wound several others, and nearly send the U.S. over the brink. Imagine had there been an organized effort by sophisticated actors with the level of (in)security now coming to light. Unsecured rooftop only 150 yards from the former president? No problem. Unprepared Secret Service egress plan? No problem. Agents not physically large enough to shield the 6'3\" president? No problem. Uninterdicted \"person of interest\" with a range finder in the area? No problem. Just let Trump trot out to the podium and keep those fingers crossed.\n\nSaturday was a virtual perfect storm of failure. Answers need to be forthcoming.

Was there coordination between the FBI, USSS, and the WPFC prior to President Trump's event on July 13? How many buildings had to be secured inside and outside of the security perimeter for President Trump's event on July 13? Why was the roof of the AGR International building left unsecured? How much time elapsed between identifying the shooter as a potential threat and the attempted assassination? How much time elapsed between the local police officer encountering the shooter on the sloped roof and the attempted assassination? Has the FBI interviewed the local police officer who encountered the shooter? What does the FBI's evaluation of the shooter's phone and digital activity show about his actions and movements in the days and hours leading up to the attempted assassination? Is the FBI's investigation limited to the shooter and his motivations or does it include the security failures that led to the attempted assassination? Was the security posture at President Trump's event limited due to resource constraints with the NATO Summit and/or Jill Biden's event in Pittsburgh? How did communication breakdowns between various law enforcement entities affect the ability of local law enforcement and USSS to identify the shooter as a potential threat and mitigate the threat before he took action? What actions did the USSS take to remove or cover President Trump after a threat was known or detected?\n\nSandy Fitzgerald \u2709\n\nSandy Fitzgerald has more than three decades in journalism and serves as a general assignment writer for Newsmax covering news, media, and politics.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sandy_fitzgerald@newsmax.com", "name": "Sandy Fitzgerald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Mayorkas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Mayorkas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

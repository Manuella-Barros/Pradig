The Ecuadorian consulate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nIn court Wednesday, prosecutors said Inga-Landi told police during his taped confession that he recorded portions of his attack and went off to buy drugs afterward, according to the New York Post.\n\nInga-Landi, scratches visible on his face, scowled and kept his head lowered throughout the hearing in which a judge ordered him held without bail until his next appearance on July 1, the newspaper said.\n\nAfter the court appearance, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said the arrest resulted from \"an amazing citywide manhunt.\" She also said the victims, despite the trauma they experienced, provided key details to police, including information about a tattoo.\n\nOne resident who helped capture him said residents were sure they had the right person when his shirt came off and they saw the tattoo.\n\nIn a release, Katz said the attack \"on two children in broad daylight in a city park strikes the very core of our society.\"\n\nKenny said members of the community, including a landlord who said Inga-Landi had tried to rent a room from him two weeks earlier, provided \"crucial information\" as the police department saturated the area with detectives and distributed pictures and a video of the suspect on social media.\n\nThe response from the community even before the arrest was so strong that police knew Inga-Landi's identity, had accessed his Facebook page and had a \"dead-on\" sketch along with photographs and video, Kenny said.\n\nHe said local residents who lived on the block where the arrest occurred ensured that once he was spotted, he couldn't go anywhere, apparently even using a belt to hold his feet together.\n\nKenny said at least 10 individuals kept him in place until police arrived. Authorities said he was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital after his arrest.\n\nAngela Sauretti told The Daily Beast that she spotted Inga-Landi, wearing a black hoodie, in the deli and put him in a headlock when he tried to flee.\n\n\"He said, 'Let me explain!' I'm like, 'There's nothing to explain. You're a rapist,'\" she recalled.\n\nSauretti said Inga-Landi crawled under a car \"like a cat,\" but community members surrounded it to prevent his escape.", "source": {"uri": "wbal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissena_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kissena Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona,_Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corona, Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corona, Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machete", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicatessen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delicatessen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queens County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_Katz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melinda Katz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confession (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhunt (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2100/2023/06/06143349/wbal-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663308", "eventUri": "eng-9663308", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1989, "textEnd": 1995}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

The Ecuadorian consulate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nKenny said members of the community, including a landlord who recalled that Inga-Landi had tried to rent a room from him two weeks ago, provided \"crucial information\" as the police department saturated the area with detectives and distributed pictures and a video of the suspect on social media.\n\nThe response from the community even before the arrest was so strong that police knew Inga-Landi's identity, had accessed his Facebook page and had a \"dead-on\" sketch along with photographs and video, Kenny said.\n\nHe said local residents who lived on the block where the arrest occurred ensured that once he was spotted, he couldn't go anywhere, apparently even using a belt to hold his feet together.\n\nKenny said at least 10 individuals kept him in place until police arrived.\n\nAngela Sauretti, 23, told The Daily Beast that she spotted Inga-Landi, wearing a black hoodie, in the deli and put him in a headlock when he tried to flee.\n\n\"He said, 'Let me explain!' I'm like, 'There's nothing to explain. You're a rapist,'\" she recalled.\n\nSauretti said Inga-Landi crawled under a car \"like a cat,\" but community members surrounded it to prevent his escape.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

A sketch was also released of the suspect which included his unique tattoo of a boar. However, the information regarding his tattoo is unclear, as other sources have claimed that it actually depicts a bull.\n\nQueens residents responded to the call for help by giving Inga-Landi's name, his discovered Facebook account, and pictures that matched his tattoo, as well as the clothing he wore during the sexual assault, Kenny said.\n\n\"One of the tips we actually received was from a landlord who stated [that] the male had come to his building about two weeks previous trying to rent the room,\" he said.\n\n\"Inga-Landi has no prior arrests in New York City and one out-of-state arrest for entering the United States illegally through Eagle Pass, Texas in June 2021,\" according to ABC 7 News.\n\nAfter being released from custody, Inga-Landi reportedly traveled to Queens, where police issued him three summonses and later encountered him in a domestic violence situation after they were called by neighbors. However, he somehow managed to escape arrest in NYC at the time.\n\nAuthorities were informed that after the suspect flashed his machete-style knife, he then led the two teens to a secluded area and tied their wrists together with shoelaces before he sexually assaulted the girl. He then reportedly stole both victims' cell phones and told them to stay put for 20 minutes while he fled, according to police.\n\nAfter he left, the teens quickly ran to their nearby school, where they alerted staff of what took place. The school called 9-1-1 in response.\n\nThe attack prompted a massive manhunt in the area, and a larger-than-usual police presence in the park was made apparent for multiple days.

Inga-Landi then allegedly drew a \"large machete-style knife\" and forced the teens to a remote, wooded area of the park, where he allegedly bound the victims together and raped the young girl, as Blaze News previously reported.\n\nAt the scene, police recovered a water bottle with DNA that matched a DNA sample Inga-Landi gave for his immigration case in 2021.\n\nFive days later, Inga-Landi was apprehended in a citizens' arrest and then handed over to police. Not only did Inga-Landi match images of the suspect shared by law enforcement, but he also has braces and a boar tattoo across his chest, as the victims had described.\n\nInga-Landi has now been charged with 11 total counts, the vast majority of which are felonies. His charges include rape, predatory sexual assault, robbery, and kidnapping.\n\nOn Wednesday, he appeared in court for arraignment, his face still marked with scratches. Prosecutors did not have to do much to convince Judge Joanne Watters to deny him bail.\n\nAll they had to do was read the transcript of a video of Inga-Landi speaking with investigators. The details of the transcript included in the Post's report are bone-chilling.\n\nDuring their conversation, Inga-Landi not only admitted to police that he committed the crime, but he also bragged that he filmed it, the transcript showed. \"I was nervous at first, then got comfortable and recorded it,\" he apparently said on video, an admission that prompted \"sighs from the audience,\" according to the Post.\n\nHe also apparently offered cops other details of the incident from his perspective. For instance, he alleged that he caught the victims having \"sexual relations.\" He also claimed that, before the assault, he stuffed a banana in the girl's mouth, ostensibly to keep her quiet.\n\n\"I went to buy drugs, afterwards,\" Inga-Landi added, according to the transcript read by prosecutors.\n\nAt the scene, police recovered a water bottle with DNA that matched a DNA sample Inga-Landi gave for his immigration case in 2021. The following year, a judge ruled that he had made unlawful entry into the U.S. and ordered him to leave. Whether he ever followed that directive is unclear.\n\nBetween his history of breaking border laws and the current accusations of a vicious kidnapping and sexual assault, Assistant District Attorney Kasey Esposito requested that Judge Watters deny Inga-Landi bail. \"The brazen and brutal nature of this defendant's actions are indicative of someone who does not follow the law, and who has no regard for anybody else, but himself, and he will not return to court,\" Esposito argued.\n\nJudge Watters quickly agreed, though Lisa Saltzman, Inga-Landi's public defender, did not make a request for bail during the hearing. Instead, she asked that Inga-Landi receive medical attention, which Watters granted.\n\nInga-Landi is scheduled to appear in court again on July 1. An investigation into the alleged film of the rape remains ongoing.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A&E_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A&E Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissena_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kissena Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen's_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizen's arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Banana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_defender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public defender"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/courtroom-gasps-after-illegal-alien-apparently-admits-he-filmed-himself-raping-13-year-old-in-nyc-park.jpg?id=52480077&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C232", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663308", "eventUri": "eng-9663308", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 3334, "textEnd": 3340}], "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Wednesday, the Ecuadorian migrant accused of raping a 13-year-old girl in a Queens park, where he bound and gagged her, confessed to recording the assault.\n\nThe chilling admission by Christian Geovanny Inga-Landi, 25, broke the otherwise-hushed court hearing in which he was arraigned on charges of rape, kidnapping and a raft of other felonies from the shocking June 13 attack in Kissena Park.\n\n\"I was nervous at first, then got comfortable and recorded it,\" Inga-Landi admitted in the video, prosecutors said in Queens Criminal Court, drawing sighs from the audience.\n\nInga-Landi, who had scratches visible on his face, scowled and kept his head down throughout the arraignment, including as a judge ordered him held without bail until his next court appearance July 1.\n\nThe shocking videotaped statement, a transcript of which was read in court by Assistant District Attorney Kasey Esposito, revealed new details about the broad-daylight attack in which the girl and a boy, both 13, were held at knifepoint with a \"machete-style\" blade.\n\nInga-Landi, who contended he had a drug problem, told cops he stumbled across the two teens having \"sexual relations,\" Esposito read.\n\nHe pulled out a knife he found in the park and threatened the teens with it, he told authorities.\n\nThe migrant tied the teens together with a shoelace, stuffed a bandana in the girl's mouth and cut off her shorts and underwear, Inga-Landi allegedly said in the video.\n\n\"I went to buy drugs, afterwards,\" he said, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe assault prompted a five-day manhunt that ended Tuesday in a dramatic, caught-on-video takedown by neighborhood good Samaritans who said they recognized Inga-Landi as the wanted rapist, swarmed him and tied him up.\n\n\"Once we noticed it was him, everyone just was going crazy on him,\" said Angela Sauretti, who called 911 while her brother pounded on the suspect.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

And everything just spiraled from there.'\n\nFootage of his capture went viral on Tuesday showing Inga-Landi cowering under car and surrounded by furious residents before being tied to a post as police raced to the scene.\n\nA woman, thought to be Sauretti was recorded roaring 'I beat the s*** out of him', before explaining on Tuesday how she was determined to impress on the suspected rapist that his downfall had come at the hands of a woman.\n\n'As a woman, I had to really set the tone and remind him, 'It wasn't a man that did this to you. It was a woman,' the aspiring radiologist explained.\n\n'You did that to a woman, and a woman got back and did this to you.\n\nInga was seen on Tuesday being led out of police custody to be taken to court to face charges\n\nWitnesses said that Inga-Landi attempted to flee before police arrived but was tied to the lamppost with a belt\n\nAn image showed the shirtless suspect being led away by police wearing just one shoe after the tussle with a group of locals\n\n'So it had him contemplating, 'Maybe I won't mess with the next woman.' Because you never know. There's nice ones and there's ones that will really defend themselves and go all out.\n\n'He said, 'Let me explain!' I'm like, 'There's nothing to explain. You're a rapist, you raped a little girl', he said, 'I don't care'.\n\n'So that's why we put our hands and feet on him. I don't regret it at all.'\n\nBy this time more had joined the attempt to restrain him, including Isabel Caizado, 67, who kicked him before taking off one of her shoes to hit him with it.\n\nThe man's hoodie and T-shirt came off as he struggled to get away revealing a chest tattoo that Sauretti recognized from the NYPD appeal.\n\n'That's what made us go even harder,' Sauretti said.\n\nInga-Landi crossed the southern border at Eagle Pass, Texas, in 2021, and Daniel Ramos, who assisted in his capture, said he overheard him an hour earlier revealing he planned to board a plane for his native Ecuador later that morning.\n\nPolice arrested him and took him from the 112 Precinct station house on Tuesday morning to court where he faces multiple charges of rape, kidnap and sex abuse.\n\nPolice said Christian Geovanny Inga-Landi approached the girl and a 13-year-old boy at Kissena Corridor Park while brandishing a machete\n\nThe attack took place on Thursday around three miles from the Citi Field stadium, in the neighborhood of the victim's school\n\nSauretti, the daughter of a school crossing guard may be in line for the $10,000 reward put up for Inga-Landi's capture, but says it was not on her mind as she restrained the heavily built suspect.\n\n'I would have done it even if it wasn't a reward, because at the end of the day, I feel as if that's the right thing to do,' she said.\n\n'I have structure. I have boundaries. I know where I stand, what I like, what I don't like, what I want to do, what I don't want to do.\n\n'Nobody can peer pressure me. Nobody can tell me what to do.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanted_poster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wanted poster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_light", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Street light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peer pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machete", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoodie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Pass,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eagle Pass, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eagle Pass, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Men's", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Men's", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Rape", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Rape", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/19/05/86299061-0-image-m-24_1718772304310.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663308", "eventUri": "eng-9663308", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He had been on the run for several days after the attack on a 13-year-old girl in Kissena Park in Queens.\n\nThe New York Post reported that the Ecuadorian migrant was charged with predatory sexual assault, first-degree rape, two counts of second-degree kidnapping, two counts of first-degree robbery, second-degree rape, first-degree sexual abuse, obstructing governmental administration, and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child.\n\nProsecutors said in court that Inga-Landi, who illegally entered the U.S. in 2021, stated during a videotaped confession: \"I was nervous at first, then got comfortable and recorded it.\" Assistant District Attorney Kasey Esposito reportedly read the transcript of the videotaped statement.\n\nInga-Landi told law enforcement that he came across two teenagers who were having \"sexual relations,\" and he threatened them with a knife.\n\nThe illegal alien tied them together, stuffed a bandana in the girl's mouth and cut off her shorts and underwear, and then raped her.\n\nHe then took their phones, ran away, and bought drugs, prosecutors said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nDNA from the crime scene matched a sample Inga-Landi gave to immigration authorities three years ago, the report said.\n\nAuthorities were still investigating his claim that he recorded the rape, which could result in numerous additional charges being filed.\n\nThe New York Post separately reported that a federal immigration judge ordered him to be deported in February 2022, according to sources at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

A story that begins with a man from Ecuador who entered the United States illegally, and remained in the United States illegally, is bad enough. But when he attacks two 13-year-old children, a boy and a girl, in New York, tying them up and raping the girl, and recording it, that's a new level of awful:\n\nThe Ecuadorian migrant charged with raping a 13-year-old girl he bound and gagged in a Queens park told cops he recorded the attack during a sickening taped confession, prosecutors alleged Wednesday.\n\nThe chilling admission by Christian Geovanny Inga-Landi, 25, broke the silence in an otherwise-hushed court hearing in which he was arraigned on charges of rape, predatory sexual assault, kidnapping and a raft of other felonies from the shocking June 13 attack in Kissena Park.\n\n\"I was nervous at first, then got comfortable and recorded it,\" Inga-Landi admitted in the videotaped statement, prosecutors said in Queens Criminal Court, drawing sighs from the audience.\n\nInga-Landi, who had scratches visible on his face, scowled and kept his head down throughout the arraignment, including as Judge Joanne B. Watters ordered him held without bail until his next court appearance July 1.\n\nHe got comfortable.\n\nHe got comfortable with committing forcible rape.\n\nHe got comfortable with raping a child.\n\nHe got so comfortable with raping a child that he recorded it. What he intended to do with that recording does not bear contemplation.\n\nFortunately, he was caught, by the citizens, as well as a sharp-eyed New Yorker who recognized him. Honestly, Inga-Landi is more fortunate than he probably realizes that he was not immediately ripped apart by an angry mob. And if he had been, well, most of our sympathies would be with the mob:\n\nThe assault prompted a five-day manhunt that drew a torrent of tips and ended Tuesday in a dramatic, caught-on-video takedown by neighborhood good Samaritans who said they recognized Inga-Landi as the wanted rapist, swarmed him and tied him up.\n\n\"Once we noticed it was him, everyone just was going crazy on him,\" said Angela Sauretti, who called 911 while her brother pounded on the suspect.\n\nAny American worth the name would have happily tossed a few punches on this creature.\n\nPreviously on RedState: Watch: When the Government Fails to Uphold Justice, the People Take Justice Into Their Own Hands\n\nYikes! 80K 'Dreamers' With Arrest Records Let in to US in First Five Years of DACA\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nInga, who entered the U.S. through Eagle Pass, Tex., with a 3-year-old child in June 2021, was staying at a single-room occupancy in a Queens basement, police said.\n\nAfter he crossed into the U.S., he lost his immigration status and was required to return to Ecuador, but never did. He currently has a warrant out for his arrest by immigration authorities.\n\nHe entered with a 3-year-old child. Whose child? He apparently has an ex-wife and two children. Was the child his? If not, whose was the child? Where is the child now? No one knows.\n\nThis incident can be laid directly at the feet of DHS Secretary Aljandrp Mayorkas, who has overseen the calamitous collapse of our southern border, and his boss, President Joe Biden. In a just world, they would be lying awake in bed every night, subjected to images of the faces of the two, 13-year-old New Yorkers assaulted by Christian Geovanny Inga-Landi, broadcast on the ceiling and all four walls, non-stop. Inga-Landi committed the crime, and with any luck, he will never breathe free air again - and we can hope the death penalty is not off the table for this person who essentially forfeited his humanity by this attack.\n\nBut there can be no evading the fact that the Biden administration, by its deliberate reversal of Trump-era policies and its subsequent abandonment of any pretense of control over our southern border, created the conditions by which Inga-Landi was able to enter the United States and remain here, in violation of the law.\n\nTwo children have paid for that abandonment, and their lives are forever changed. But they are not politically useful to the administration, so it's unlikely we will hear anything more about this from the White House or DHS.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news",

He even had three summonses from the city, plus what ABC called \"a domestic violence encounter with police that did not result in arrest.\"\n\nAlthough Inga-Landi entered the U.S. illegally, he will benefit -- and should benefit -- from the American legal system's presumption of innocence. He broke the law in crossing the border. But we cannot assume, without trial, that he also raped a child.\n\nIf he did commit that heinous crime, however, perhaps his recent experiences with America's once-vaunted legal system helped embolden him.\n\nOn Thursday, around 3:30 p.m. in Kissena Park, Queens, a person described as a 5-foot-5 Hispanic male in his 20s approached two schoolmates, a 13-year-old male and a 13-year-old female.\n\nThe assailant then produced a weapon that police called a \"large machete-style knife.\" He forced the children to walk into a wooded area, took their cellphones, tied their wrists with shoelaces and raped the girl before fleeing on foot.\n\nConsidering the brazenness of the crime -- an attack in broad daylight -- would it be unreasonable to speculate that perhaps an illegal immigrant, who hitherto had suffered no consequences for his lawbreaking, might have assumed that he would get away with this crime, too?\n\nAfter all, what evidence could possibly convince an illegal immigrant that federal officials care about Americans' safety?\n\nIn addition to the two surviving victims, this story does have heroes.\n\nAccording to NBC New York, a group of people who live in the same rooming house as Inga-Landi, including a man named Jeffrey Flores, recognized him from wanted posters.\n\nFlores and some friends then waited on the suspect at a local bodega he was known to frequent. When he appeared, they ambushed him and tied his legs together with a belt.\n\n\"Come get him,\" they said after calling 911.\n\nMeanwhile, information provided by the two victims made that capture possible.\n\nBefore fleeing the scene of the assault, the rapist ordered the children to stay put for 20 minutes. They obeyed, undoubtedly from fear and shock, before returning to school and reporting the attack.\n\nNew York Police Department Commissioner Edward Cab\u00e1n credited the children with providing \"crucial\" information about the assailant. Cab\u00e1n also praised everyone involved in the apprehension.\n\n\"This is exactly what we mean when talk about public safety is a shared responsibility,\" the NYPD commissioner said. \"The past few days proved to the world again that the people in this city can come together and get the job done like no one else.\"\n\nInga-Landi now faces multiple charges, including rape, sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery and endangering child welfare.\n\nWhile the legal presumption of Inga-Landi's innocence remains, so does the indisputable crime of Biden's open border.\n\nEarlier this year, police in Georgia arrested illegal immigrant Jose Antonio Ibarra of Venezuela and charged him with the murder of nursing student Laken Riley. A grand jury has since indicted Ibarra on charges in addition to murder.\n\nDuring his tyrannical State of the Union address in March, Biden twice botched Riley's name. Afterward, Democrats fumed -- not at the insult to Riley and her family, but because Biden had referred to Ibarra as an \"illegal.\" The repellent president later apologized for using the word \"illegal\" to describe an illegal immigrant and alleged murderer.\n\nWomen and girls have always faced threats from predators. In the absence of Biden's open border, they would continue to face such threats. After all, legal citizens commit heinous crimes, too.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that illegal immigrants stand charged with Riley's murder, the rape of a 13-year-old girl in New York and other violent crimes. And those particular crimes would not have occurred had Biden and the Democrats not refused to secure the border.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump returns to the White House, those crimes will no longer happen.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_schwarz@westernjournal.com", "name": "Michael Schwarz", "type":

which he was arraigned on charges of rape, kidnapping and a raft of other felonies from the shocking June 13 attack in Kissena Park.\n\n\"I was nervous at first, then got comfortable and recorded it,\" Inga-Landi admitted in the video, prosecutors said in Queens Criminal Court, drawing sighs from the audience.\n\nInga-Landi, who had scratches visible on his face, scowled and kept his head down throughout the arraignment, including as a judge ordered him held without bail until his next court appearance July 1.\n\nThe shocking videotaped statement, a transcript of which was read in court by Assistant District Attorney Kasey Esposito, revealed new details about the broad-daylight attack in which the girl and a boy, both 13, were held at knifepoint with a \"machete-style\" blade.\n\nInga-Landi, who contended he had a drug problem, told cops he stumbled across the two teens having \"sexual relations,\" Esposito read.\n\nHe pulled out a knife he found in the park and threatened the teens with it, he told authorities.\n\nThe migrant tied the teens together with a shoelace, stuffed a bandana in the girl's mouth and cut off her shorts and underwear, Inga-Landi allegedly said in the video.\n\n\"I went to buy drugs, afterwards,\" he said, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe assault prompted a five-day manhunt that ended Tuesday in a dramatic, caught-on-video takedown by neighborhood good Samaritans who said they recognized Inga-Landi as the wanted rapist, swarmed him and tied him up.\n\n\"Once we noticed it was him, everyone just was going crazy on him,\"

The incident, which occurred June 13, came to light during the hearing where Inga-Landi's videotaped confession was presented, revealing he recorded the attack after initially feeling nervous, according to the New York Post.\n\n\"I was nervous at first, then got comfortable and recorded it,\" Inga-Landi admitted in the videotaped statement, the outlet reported.\n\nInga-Landi remained silent and downcast as prosecutors detailed the allegations against him. Inga-Landi encountered two teenagers in the park and allegedly escalated an assault using a machete-style knife, according to Assistant District Attorney Kasey Esposito, New York Post stated. He allegedly tied the victims with a shoelace, gagged the girl and proceeded to rape her. After the assault, he allegedly stole their phones and discarded them before buying drugs.\n\n\"I went to buy drugs, afterwards,\" he said, the outlet reported.\n\nThe case has drawn attention due to the heinous nature of the crime and Inga-Landi's background, including a prior order by an immigration judge in 2022 to leave the U.S. after he was deemed an inadmissible alien.

Himself and a group of others identified Inga-Landi in a photograph as the suspect who allegedly tied up a 13-year-old boy and girl with a shoelace in the woods, where he then allegedly raped the young girl.\n\nRamos said he joined roughly ten of his friends in a deli located at 108th and Waldron Street, where the suspect was said to frequently be located. The suspect arrived at the deli around midnight where the group waited for hours.\n\n\"When he came to the store, my friend Jeffrey and Angelo -- they both came in, they saw him when he went to the store, and they're the ones who took him out of the store. They tried to apprehend him in the store, and then we just caught him outside,\" Ramos told Fox News' Bill Hemmer and Sandra Smith during a Thursday segment.\n\nFootage showed the group surrounding Inga-Landi after he had been forcibly dragged out of the deli, according to the New York Post. The suspect reportedly crawled under a parked car to hide from the group after he failed to fight back. Police arrived shortly after and escorted Inga-Landi in handcuffs, the outlet reported. (RELATED: 'No One's Been Worse Than Him': Brian Kilmeade Pushes Wes Moore To Condemn Joe Biden's Border Policy)\n\n\"He knew better not to put up a fight,\" Ramos continued. \"He couldn't really put up a fight because he was outnumbered and it probably would've went worse if he did. It was better that he didn't. And he was just trying to come up with a plea, like trying to say, you know, 'let me explain.' At first he said he didn't care what he did, then he tried to say 'let me explain,' but we wasn't trying to hear any of it and there was nothing really to explain. What he did was horrible and he did that to an innocent 13-year-old little girl. So we don't condone that.\"\n\nAnother Good Samaritan, Jeffrey Flores, told NBC News that he punched and kicked Inga-Landi before placed him in a headlock and used a belt to tie his legs down. The suspect reported yelled \"help\" repeatedly in Spanish, but did not deny the rape allegations, Flores added.\n\n\"Yeah he admitted to it. He said, 'Alright, alright, fine, fine. Just leave me alone, don't hit me, don't hit me,'\" Flores told NBC New York.\n\nInga-Landi is charged with several counts including rape, robbery, sexual assault, kidnapping and endangering child welfare, according to NBC News. The New York Police Department had reportedly offered a $10,000 award for information leading to the arrest along with a photograph of the suspect.\n\n\"This is exactly what we mean when talk about public safety is a shared responsibility,\" NYPD Commissioner Edward Cab\u00e1n said regarding the arrest, NBC News reported. \"The past few days proved to the world again that the people in this city can come together and get the job done like no one else.\"\n\nThe two children were allegedly located on a field in Kissena Park around 3 p.m. after school when a curly-haired man with braces approached them and demanded they follow him into the woods, the NYPD said at a press conference. He allegedly pulled out a \"large machete-style knife\" in response to the kids' refusal, forcibly led them into the woods, tied them up with a shoelace, and raped the girl.\n\nNYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said in the press conference that Indi-Landi illegally entered the U.S. through a border entry in Eagle Pass, Texas, on June 25, 2021.\n\nThe kids told authorities he warned them to remain at the location for 20 minutes, and ran away with their phones, NBC News reported. They rushed to their school after that period of time and informed administrators what had happened, leading to an immediate 911 call.\n\nCrimes committed by illegal immigrants have seemingly risen as border apprehensions have soared to record-highs throughout President Joe Biden's administration. Authorities in Maryland arrested 23-year-old Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, in connection to the rape and murder of 37-year-old Rachel Morin, a mother of five.\n\nProsecutors charged Jose Ibarra, an illegal immigrant from Venezuela, with the murder of 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley. Ibarra allegedly seriously disfigured her skull with an inanimate object outside of the University of Georgia's campus in February, documents obtained by WSB-TV say.\n\nBorder apprehensions have surged to record-highs since Biden assumed office in January 2021. Border authorities apprehended over 1.5 million migrants in the 2024 fiscal year thus far, with a record of over 300,000 crossing the border in December alone, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Apprehensions surged above 2 million in the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years.\n\nThe number of apprehensions totaled 400,651 in the 2020 fiscal year, the final year of former President Donald Trump's term,

Most of the major networks omitted the story, as it does not reflect favorably on Biden's immigration policy.\n\nShockingly, the most Biden-sycophantic network reported on the arrest of the illegal alien child rapist that was busted in New York City after citizens intervened. Watch the report in its entirety, as aired on ABC World News Tonight on Tuesday, June 18th, 2024:\n\nABC WORLD NEWS TONIGHT\n\n6/18/24\n\n6:39 PM\n\nDAVID MUIR: Tonight here in New York City, the NYPD arresting the suspect after a horrific daytime sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl in a park. Here's Aaron Katersky.\n\nAARON KATERSKY: This is the suspect police in New York say sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl after school in a Queens park, forcing her into the woods at knifepoint. The broad daylight attack shocked the city, and tonight, police are crediting people in the neighborhood for the arrest.\n\nJOE KENNY: They knew who he was. When they saw him out on the street, they tried to detain him. They called 911.\n\nKATERSKY: This photo obtained by ABC News shows police detaining Christian Geovanny Inga-Landi early this morning. The migrant from Ecuador entered the U.S. illegally in 2021 through Eagle Pass, Texas. After Thursday's attack, police released this video of the suspect. People in the neighborhood recognizing him.\n\nHEROIC NEIGHBOR: I see him walk into the store, and I had to take him out. And I told everybody, Yo, this is the rapist. You know, I punched him. I kicked him a little. I ain't going to lie.\n\nKATERSKY: The 13-year-old and a male friend were in the park after school when police say Inga-Landi pulled a large knife and ordered them into a secluded part of Kissena park and sexually assaulted the girl in front of her friend. Police said the suspect told them, David, that he happened to find that large knife, had never done anything like this before, and had a drug problem. Tonight, he's charged with rape, with kidnapping, and a slew of other crimes, David.\n\nMUIR: Aaron Katersky here in New York tonight. Thank you, Aaron.\n\nWhy might ABC cover this story, as opposed to CBS or NBC? Geography, for starters. ABC is the network likeliest to report on local New York crime stories. But beyond that, we're baffled.\n\nThe story of the arrest of an illegal alien child rapist, complete with the sort of pre-arrest neighborhood beatdown one normally sees on the Spanish-speaking side of the dial, on such programs as Univision's Primer Impacto or Telemundo's Al Rojo Vivo, which routinely depict alleged child rapists getting beaten within an inch of their lives. And sometimes beyond. For those keeping score at home, Univision reported on the arrest while Telemundo did not.\n\nBack to ABC- they hit all the spots. They reported the arrest, the details of the crime, the neighborhood beatdown, and the fact that the suspect entered the country illegally in 2021.\n\nThe Regime Media largely chose to hide this story on the day that Biden offered more immigration relief, and perhaps additional incentives for others to stream illegally into the country. To ABC's credit, they reported the inconvenient story anyway. CBS and NBC did not.", "source": {"uri": "newsbusters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://newsbusters.org/"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_World_News_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ABC World News Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Muir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Muir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alien (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Pass,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eagle Pass, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eagle Pass, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_Impacto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primer Impacto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemundo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telemundo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univision", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Univision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://cdn.newsbusters.org/styles/mobile_thumb_700x400_/s3/2024-06/ABC%20World%20News%20Tonight%20With%20David%20Muir-6_40_15%20pm-2024-06-18%20%281%29.jpg?itok=nAonwd38", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663308", "eventUri": "eng-9663308", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

by a torrent of tips from the local Queens community, from surveillance video provided by neighbors and shopkeepers to a 911 call from a woman -- Angela Sauretti -- who spotted Inga-Landi outside a bodega, police and witnesses said.\n\nOne good Samaritan, Jeffrey Flores, told The Post he waited outside a 108th Street deli near the park all day because he knew the suspect frequented it -- and then tied up Inga-Landi after a crowd beat up on him.\n\n\"We're New Yorkers and we stick together,\" said Joseph Kenny, the NYPD's chief of detectives, on Fox News. \"When we something's wrong, we band together and make things right.\"\n\nThe reward was offered a day after the June 13 attack, in which police said an \"animal\" forced the victim and a boy, both 13, into a secluded wooded area in Kissena, Park at knifepoint, tied them up and raped the girl.\n\nSources told The Post that $3,500 of the reward came from the Crime Stoppers Program, with the remaining sum coming from the New York City Police Foundation.\n\nIf and when a tipster comes forward to claim the reward, a police foundation committee will review the claim and divvy out the prize accordingly, sources said.\n\nThe

Greg Abbott making the popular illegal crossing destination a focal point of \"Operation Lone Star\" last year.\n\nAs part of the operation at Eagle Pass, Texas authorities placed razor wire near popular border crossings, erected a wall of shipping containers near the river, and deployed thousands of Texas National Guard troops and Department of Public Safety officers to the area in a bid to deter illegal immigrants from crossing.\n\nMIGRANT ARRESTED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT RAPE OF 13-YEAR-OLD IN NEW YORK PARK\n\nIn February, the state announced plans to build an 80-acre camp near the city that will serve as an operating base for roughly 2,000 more National Guard troops, an escalation of its feud with the federal government.\n\nWhile Texas has been pushing more resources to Eagle Pass since 2021, it has increased efforts in the area significantly over the last year, blaming the expiration of Title 42, a pandemic-era order that allowed authorities to quickly deport illegal migrants.\n\nThe federal government has been ramping up pressure on the state to limit its operations throughout the last year as well, filing lawsuits against the state and having federal agents cut the razor wire laid by Texas authorities. A lower court ruling initially barred Border Patrol agents from cutting state-owned wire, but that ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 5-4 October decision.\n\nThe fight over control of the border at Eagle Pass is the result of its unique position, being one of the most popular crossing points for illegal migrants into Texas.\n\nNEW YORK CITY GIRL, 13, SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AT KNIFEPOINT DURING BRAOD DAYLIGHT IN PARK: POLICE\n\n\"As a key point in the busy sector of del Rio, Eagle Pass has seen an unprecedented movement of migrants in the past three years,\" Alfonso Aguilar, the director of Hispanic outreach at American Principles Project, told Fox News Digital. \"It has received particular attention because it is one of the areas where Texas Gov. Greg Abbott decided to make a stand to try to stem the massive flow of migrants.\"\n\n\"Gov. Abbott has been forced to take action since the federal government has broken its compact with the states to protect the border,\" Aguilar added.\n\nInga-Landi was just one of thousands who have crossed the border in the area, with police sources telling Fox News that he was processed, released and given a court hearing date. Police sources say he told agents his destination was an address in Queens, New York.\n\nHe is accused of the rape of the 13-year-old girl in broad daylight last week, with police saying he allegedly wielded a machete as he approached the girl and a 13-year-old boy she was with, tied the two together, and raped the girl at a popular park.\n\nBIDEN, TEXAS FEUD OVER ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION LAW AS MIGRANTS RUSH BORDER: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nSurveillance video of the area led police to identify Inga-Landi as the primary suspect, after which tips pertaining to his whereabouts came flooding in.\n\nHe was eventually arrested after a group of neighbors recognized him from a wanted poster, with about 10 people holding him down until police could arrive to arrest him in the early morning hours Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Aguilar, more criminals like Inga-Landi will be allowed in at crossings like Eagle Pass if such hot spots aren't secured.\n\n\"By not enforcing the law and by countering the efforts of states like Texas to protect the border, the Biden administration is ensuring that more criminals and individuals linked to terrorist organizations can easily enter the country, putting the lives of our citizens everywhere in the country at risk,\" Aguilar said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for

He is still here, this \"Ecuadorian migrant\", as The New York Post dubs him. Just yesterday, he sat in a courtroom with his public defender (funded by the taxpayers) and admitted to recording his attack on this young girl:\n\nI was nervous at first, then got comfortable and recorded it.\"-Christian Geovannny Inga-Landy\n\nNervous at first? This sick you-know-what decided to pull out his phone (probably sponsored by Biden and Mayorkas) and record this heinous act. Inga-Landi held two teenagers-a boy and a girl-at knifepoint with a \"machete-style blade\" in the attack in Kissena Park in Queens on June 13th. He raped the 13 year-old girl. This sick SOB also has a child of his own, and was detained in Texas after crossing illegally in 2021.\n\nHe crossed the besieged US-Mexico border on June 25, 2021, with his son into Eagle Pass, Texas, where he was captured, processed and released by Border Patrol agents, according to the sources.\n\nHe and his then-3-year-old son were released to a local nonprofit organization with a document providing a future court date known as a Notice to Appear document,'-Jennie Tier, The New York Post\n\nIllegal \"migrants\" can only be held for 72 hours, apparently. So, Inga-Landi was released to go sponge off the system because of \"humanitarian\" reasons. He claimed he was going to live in an apartment in Flushing, New York.\n\nThe migrant tied the teens together with a shoelace, stuffed a bandana in the girl's mouth and cut off her shorts and underwear, Inga-Landi allegedly said in the video.\n\nAfter Inga-Landi raped the girl, he told the kids to wait 20 minutes while he ran off with their phones and threw them away.\"-Assistant District Attorney Kasey Esposito\n\nAnd, what did this illegal piece of trash do after he violated a 13 year-old girl?\n\nI went to buy drugs, afterwards.\"-Christian Geovannny Inga-Landy\n\nSo, here we are, folks. Inga-Landy is being held without bail until July 1. Inga-Landy gets a public defender. But Inga-Landy somehow, has enough capital to \"buy drugs afterwards\".\n\nThank God for some sanity. Enter Jeffrey Flores, a Corona, Queens resident, who tracked down the perp and turned him in. Inga-Landy was described as having a large boar tattoo on his chest. Appropriate because the poor excuse for a man is a pig, but I do not want to insult pigs. Inga-Landy also was described as having \"dental braces\" on his teeth.\n\nBraces are expensive? WHO paid for them?\n\nInga-Landy is also now blaming his crime on drug addiction. He's \"never done this before\". This was the \"first time\" he raped a teenage girl.\n\nMust be all of the troubles he saw and trauma he endured in Ecuador. This is why he takes drugs and behaves this way, the bleeding heart, pro-(illegal) immigration advocates would say. He wanted to give his son a \"dream\", or something.\n\nI call BS. And, meanwhile...\n\nThis is more than the fault of the illegal criminals who come into this country to do crime because crime is the only lifestyle they know. This is not only on the hands of Joe Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas. This is on the hands of New York Governor, Kathy Hochul, and NYC Mayor, Eric Adams. They've also allowed this to happen.\n\nCouldn't happen to a nicer guy, but don't bet the farm that justice will be served and that he will get his ass beaten at Rikers. They will continue to \"game\" the system, as Mayorkas says because Biden and Mayorkas will let them \"game\" the system. This scumbag will be sprung. He will be let off, free to roam the streets again, sadly, this useless piece of human excrement.\n\nThe reality is that some people do indeed try to game the system. That does not speak to everyone whom we encounter, but there is an element of it, and we deal with it accordingly.\"-Alejandro Mayorkas\n\nDeal with it accordingly? Define \"accordingly\", Mr. Mayorkas...\n\nGotta keep those \"American families seeking asylum together\" even when they are not, in fact, American. Just a random musing here...has anyone asked Christian Geovannny Inga-Landy where his son is? You know, the son he illegally crossed into Texas with in 2021? I'd be willing to wager that he does not have any idea where this kid is at nor that he has done anything for this young boy since arriving in America.\n\nTo Democrats, I say this. You voted for this. Yes, there is such a thing as an illegal human. Take your \"no human is illegal\" virtuous platitude and shove it where the sun does not shine on this lovely solstice day.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

She's a 23-year-old from Queens who helped capture the city's most-wanted rapist.\n\nPolice had been searching for their suspect Christian Geovanny Inga-Landi, an illegal immigrant from Equador, who pulled a knife on a 13-year-old girl, used her shoelaces to tie her hands, and raped her in a city park. It was such a horrific crime, committed by someone who shouldn't have even been in the country, that Donald Trump talked about it during his rally in Racine.\n\nWanted posters with the suspect's picture had been plastered around the Queens neighborhood. That's when Angela Saurettispotted him coming out of a bodega. \"That's him,\" she said to her boyfriend. \"Let's take him down.\" Angela, who appears to be a petite woman, jumped him from behind and put him in a headlocked. He boyfriend joined in. And soon a large crowd gathered around. During the struggle, the suspect's shirt came off, revealing his distinctive tattoos. There was no doubt that he was the suspect. He would have been a victim of mob justice if he didn't roll underneath a car until police arrived to take him away.\n\nLet's see what happens to Christian Geovanny Inga-Landi. New York is a low-bail/no-bail city. Even violent criminals are often back on the streets the day they're arrested. There's evidence that he was planning to leave the country, knowing he was a hunted man.\n\nI'm interested in the back-story, because there's enough outrage surrounding this case that policy could actually change. Did this animal cross our southern border under the Biden Administration's policies? Was he flown to New York on one of those late night Air Biden flights?

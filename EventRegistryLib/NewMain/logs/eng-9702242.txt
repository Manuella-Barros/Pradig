The details of the deal are still unknown as this is a rapidly developing situation.\n\n\"The Golden State Warriors are in serious talks on a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Buddy Hield, league sources tell The Athletic. Warriors and 76ers have been in deep discussions, working to finalize the deal for one of the NBA's best three-point shooters.\"\n\nHield has been one of the best shooters in the NBA for the better part of the last decade. His career 3-point percentage is 40.0%, with Hield ranking fourth in total three-pointers made since he was drafted in 2016. The only players he trails are new teammate Stephen Curry, Warriors' legend Klay Thompson, and Damian Lillard, who all shot on a higher volume than Hield.\n\nBuddy averaged 12.1 points on 38.6% from three last season, playing for the Pacers and 76ers. He averaged 12.0 points on 38.4% from three in 52 games with the Pacers before averaging 12.2 points on 38.9% from three in 32 games with the 76ers.\n\nHield played in 84 games last season due to the midseason trade and broke a career-long streak of never making the playoffs. Unfortunately, he struggled in his first postseason appearance and averaged 5.5 points in under 15 minutes per game during the 76ers' first-round elimination to the Knicks.\n\nHield will replace Thompson's sharpshooting on the Warriors' lineup, possibly thriving in the team's motion offense. He has been a poor defender his entire career, even poorer than what Klay provided last season, so the Warriors will likely make additional moves to shore up their defense as well.\n\nIt's unclear what the Warriors are sending for Hield or what contract the sharpshooter is signing on. Rumblings suggest Andrew Wiggins might have found a new home, which would leave a major hole in the Warriors' wing defense which the franchise will hope Jonathan Kuminga can fill.\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

The No. 6 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft averaged 12.1 points per game over a league-best 84 regular-season games and shot a solid 38.6 percent mark from 3-point range.\n\nHere's what to know about the trade between the Warriors and 76ers as each team reshapes its roster during the 2024 NBA offseason.\n\nMORE: Why Klay Thompson chose Mavericks over Lakers after Warriors departure\n\nThe full terms of the Hield sign-and-trade have yet to be disclosed, but it stands to reason that the Warriors would surrender some second-round draft assets to acquire Hield. That would be enough for the Sixers to part with the veteran swingman, as Philadelphia would create a valuable trade exception by dealing Hield.\n\nThe Warriors can easily fit Hield onto the roster thanks to the trade exception created by Thompson's departure. That would allow this deal to come together quickly.\n\nIt's easy to understand why the Warriors would want Hield. He serves as a like-for-like swap with Thompson and should be able to provide Golden State with extra shooting talent alongside Stephen Curry. That will help offset the loss of Thompson without putting too much pressure on Brandin Podziemski.\n\nAs for the Sixers, they already made a couple of splash moves in free agency, signing Paul George to a max contract and giving Tyrese Maxey an extension worth over $200 million. Luxury-tax implications would have made keeping Hield costly, so offloading him and likely picking up a trade exception could prove valuable. It should allow Philadelphia to flesh out the roster beyond George, Maxey and Joel Embiid with some role players.\n\nMORE: Full details of LeBron James' new contract with the Lakers\n\nHield has been a solid contributor during his NBA career and is one of the league's top 3-point shooters. He has made 40 percent of his career 3-point shots and once averaged 20.7 points per game -- during the 2018-19 NBA season -- thanks to his sharpshooting capabilities.\n\nBeyond that, Hield has been ultra-durable. He has led the NBA in games played three times, including his career-high 84 contests between the Pacers and Sixers last season.\n\nBelow is a look at Hield's per-game and rate stats from the 2023-24 NBA season:", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swingman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swingman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/Buddy%20Hield%20070324.jpg?itok=nhbyjG-A", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Though expected to be a major part of the organization's rotation, his usage tailed off even further in the playoffs as the 76ers were bounced in the first round by the New York Knicks.\n\nHield finished the 2023-24 season averaging 12.1 points in 25.7 minutes per game. He also amassed 3.2 rebounds and 3.0 assists per contest while shooting a respectable 38.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nThough Hield's role in Philadelphia may have left something to be desired, he fills an immediate hole in Golden State following the departure of Thompson. The Warriors will be without another outside shooting presence alongside Steph Curry after his fellow Splash Brother reportedly left for Dallas via sign-and-trade on a deal that will pay him $50 million over the next three years.\n\nThe 76ers also took a big swing in the early days of free agency, landing former Los Angeles Clippers wing Paul George on a four-year, $212 million deal. The two-way forward would assuredly cut into Hield's time on the court, likely resulting in motivation for both the 31-year-old and the Sixers to move on.\n\nHield will now get the chance to help Curry, Draymond Green and the rest of the Warriors improve upon last season's 46-36 record and play-in tournament exit.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Warriors in Talks on Sign-and-Trade Deal for 76ers' Buddy Hield, per Report.", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/idp8g9/picture289720369/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/27c37191-6857-40a8-b69e-5b73a5554c41", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

He spent half a season in New Orleans before being shipped to the Sacramento Kings as part of the deadline deal involving DeMarcus Cousins.\n\nHield would remain in Sacramento until the deadline of the 2021-22 season, where he was sent to the Indiana Pacers as part of the blockbuster trade involving Tyrese Haliburton and Domantas Sabonis.\n\nThen, Hield was in Indiana until the 2023-24 deadline, when he was traded to the 76ers. He was the headliner in that deal.\n\nAcross the Pacers and 76ers this past season, Hield averaged 12.1 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game while shooting 43.6 percent from the field, 38.6 percent from deep, and 88.1 percent from the free throw line. He played in an incredible 84 games due to switching teams midseason.\n\nHield has always been coveted due to his sharpshooting ability, especially from 3-point land. Hield averaged 2.6 made 3-pointers a game this past season, while averaging 3.0 treys a game in his career.\n\nHield had a down year in terms of minutes per game in 2023-24, but has proven his ability to be a 20-point-per-game scorer. Hield's career-high in points per game in a season came in 2018-19, when he averaged 20.7 points per game while shooting 42.7 percent from deep en route to finishing fourth in Most Improved Player award voting. He's averaged double-digit points per game in all eight of his seasons in the NBA, and has averaged at least 15 points per game in five of those seasons.\n\nHield is not the defender that Thompson once was, but he's one of the best shooters in the league, making him a near-perfect replacement for the other half of the \"Splash Brothers\" duo.\n\nMore news: Steph Curry Breaks Silence After Klay Thompson Leaves Warriors\n\nThis is a developing story, but it sounds like the Warriors are close to bringing one of the league's best shooters to Golden State to play with superstar Stephen Curry.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noah_camras@newsweek.com", "name": "Noah Camras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domantas_Sabonis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domantas Sabonis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMarcus_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeMarcus Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splash_Brothers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Splash Brothers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Improved_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Improved Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2421405/buddy-hield.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=d036eebe7d0604913f15ff056760ad8d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Hield has been one of the NBA's best three-point shooters of the last decade, compiling impressive numbers from beyond the arc. The addition of Hield to the Warriors would come shortly after the franchise lost Klay Thompson in free agency, paving the way for him to be Curry's new back-court shooting partner.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Klay Thompson's departure to the Dallas Mavericks in free agency, the Golden State Warriors are looking to fill the three-point shooting void. The Warriors are making a real attempt to land one of the league's most consistent long-distance shooters, Buddy Hield, from the Philadelphia 76ers through a sign-and-trade deal, according to NBA insider Shams Charania.\n\nHield is coming off his first season with the 76ers after being acquired via trade. He averaged 12.2 points while knocking down three-pointers at a 38.9 percent clip during the regular season. While he didn't see the court often during the 76ers' most recent playoff run, his value remains high, as he's built a reputation as one of the best pure shooters the game has seen.\n\nHield's success as a long-range threat has been well-documented since he arrived in the league with the New Orleans Pelicans, who selected him with the No. 6 overall selection in the 2016 NBA Draft. After a brief stint in New Orleans, he was traded during his rookie season to the Sacramento Kings, where he would later enjoy the best season of his career to date.\n\nIn 2019, Hield averaged a career-high 20.7 points on a blistering 42.7 percent from distance, connecting on the fourth-most three-pointers that season with 278. He was shipped to the Indiana Pacers during the 2022 season and then sent to the 76ers two seasons later in 2024. With another trade on the horizon for Hield, he'll likely have his best chance of sticking with an NBA franchise as a member of the Warriors.\n\nHield's Potential Fit in Golden State Dangerous three-point threat may make his mark on the Warriors in 2024-25 and beyond\n\nHield's career could be given many different labels to this point, but 'underrated' may be the biggest one to mention, as he's made some incredible three-point shooting history before entering his ninth season. A career 40 percent shooter from the outside, he's just 76 three-pointers short of 2,000 total.\n\nIn a four-year stretch from the 2019-20 season to 2022-23, he placed second in the entire league for most three-pointers made, only trailing the likes of some of the most legendary three-point marksmen in the history of the game, like James Harden, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. As a potential new Golden State Warrior, there's good reason to believe that a player like Hield will thrive in their free-flowing offensive system around Curry.\n\nHield could prove to be a promising addition to the Warriors because of his ability to impact the game without the ball, as well as his catch-and-shoot ability. In 2023-24, he knocked down his catch-and-shoot opportunities from deep at a 41.8 percent rate. His corner three-point shooting also proved to be a major key to the 76ers offense in his 25.8 minutes, as he shot 51.2 percent from that spot on the floor during his time in Philadelphia.\n\nBuddy Hield Career Stats\n\nCategory\n\nStat\n\nPTS\n\n15.5\n\n3PT%\n\n40.0%\n\nTS%\n\n57.1%\n\nTotal 3PTM\n\n1,924\n\nAs a Warrior, he would be able to somewhat replace Thompson's three-point shooting threat while providing spacing and drive-and-kick potential to a team that will be solely focused on Curry if the Warriors do not acquire another star-caliber player.\n\nIf that is the case, Hield could use his time with Golden State as a return-to-form, with the opportunity to prove that he can turn back the clock as a 20-plus point scorer. With another backcourt combination of two of the league's greatest shooters, the Warriors could build a team reminiscent of years past after the acquisition of Hield.\n\nRelated Draymond Green Says Paul George Wanted to Join Warriors, Reveals What Transpired\n\nBefore joining the Philadelphia 76ers, George could have found himself as the newest member of the Golden State Warriors.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u201320_Oklahoma_City_Thunder_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019\u201320 Oklahoma City Thunder season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-24-jun-2024-05-00-pm-4451.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Hield, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft, split last season between the Indiana Pacers and the 76ers after a midseason trade. Now, he will move to the Bay Area and join a very fitting team. The Warriors will send the 76ers the Mavericks' second-round pick in 2031, per Charania.\n\nThe Warriors have been led by the Splash Brothers, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, for the past 13 years. That duo split up when free agency began and Thompson joined the Dallas Mavericks. That left the Warriors with a need for more 3-point shooting, but very few players in league history are capable of making 3s at the volume that Thompson did.\n\nWell, Hield is one of them. In all of NBA history, there have been 22 individual seasons in which a player made at least 270 3-pointers. Nine of them belong to Curry. Two belong to Thompson. And, amazingly, four belong to Hield, more than anyone else in that group besides Curry. He has made exactly 40% of his 3-pointers in the NBA on 7.6 attempts per game. Thompson shoots the same volume at 7.6 attempts per game, but is slightly more efficient at 41.3%. Hield is the closest thing the Warriors could have found to a new Splash Brother. Hield has never been Thompson's equal as a defender, but Thompson's decline in that regard was steep.\n\nThe Warriors have spent the early portion of this offseason remaking their roster with the goal of building a cheaper team. They waived Chris Paul and let Thompson walk, but have added De'Anthony Melton through the non-taxpayer mid-level exception and Kyle Anderson through a sign-and-trade. In Hield, they would be finding a player meant to replace some of Thompson's shooting volume, whereas Melton and Anderson add defense and playmaking, respectively. The Warriors are also reportedly being aggressive in attempting to land Utah Jazz star Lauri Markkanen, and given the talent drain of the past few years here, another star is probably needed for the Warriors to seriously contend for a fifth championship since 2015.\n\nOnly time will tell if they can actually do so, but Hield would be a valuable role player on a contending team.

A career 40% three-point shooter, Hield could start or come off the bench for Golden State, and play a similar role to the one Klay Thompson occupied last season.\n\nWhile this isn't the big splash some were expecting from Golden State, it is still a solid move depending on what they are sending back to the 76ers. Philadelphia expects to contend this season, so even sign and trades would be made with that in mind, which will make the return in this deal very interesting.\n\nFor Golden State, they may not be done making moves, but they have been a bit more active the last two days.\n\nDraymond Green Fires Back at NBA Legend's Outlandish Warriors Statement\n\nMajor Update on Golden State Warriors' Offseason Plans Revealed", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2913,h_1638,x_0,y_194/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_warriors/01j1vd36q3sp09q8tw03.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Though expected to be a major part of the organization's rotation, his usage tailed off even further in the playoffs as the 76ers were bounced in the first round by the New York Knicks.\n\nHield finished the 2023-24 season averaging 12.1 points in 25.7 minutes per game. He also amassed 3.2 rebounds and 3.0 assists per contest while shooting a respectable 38.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nThough Hield's role in Philadelphia may have left something to be desired, he fills an immediate hole in Golden State following the departure of Thompson. The Warriors will be without another outside shooting presence alongside Steph Curry after his fellow Splash Brother reportedly left for Dallas via sign-and-trade on a deal that will pay him $50 million over the next three years.\n\nThe 76ers also took a big swing in the early days of free agency, landing former Los Angeles Clippers wing Paul George on a four-year, $212 million deal. The two-way forward would assuredly cut into Hield's time on the court, likely resulting in motivation for both the 31-year-old and the Sixers to move on.\n\nHield will now get the chance to help Curry, Draymond Green and the rest of the Warriors improve upon last season's 46-36 record and play-in tournament exit.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3898,h_2192,x_0,y_124/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j1vegfr95g0h8ywjtr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

After four straight seasons in the top five, he dropped to seventh last year, attempting 12.6 shots per 48 minutes played.\n\nThompson (14.5) was only behind Warriors superstar Steph Curry (17.4) last season, so he doesn't quite match that volume, but maybe Hield, 31, can be a Splash Cousin of Curry's if he joins him in the Golden State backcourt.\n\nThat volume is justified: Hield has shot better than 36 percent on 3-pointers in all eight of his NBA seasons, including topping 42 percent three times.\n\nIt is also sorely needed on a team that last season had no player outside of Curry and Thompson attempt even four 3-pointers per game. With Thompson leaving, the Warriors must replace some of that volume to stretch defenses.\n\nHield started 14 of the Sixers' 32 regular-season games after acquiring him from the Pacers this spring, but he fell out of the rotation toward the end of the year as Philly's roster regained health. He played only 30 minutes over the first five games of the 76ers' playoff series against the Knicks before coach Nick Nurse rode his hot shooting in a close Game 6 loss.\n\nOne thing Hield does not provide is much resistance on the defensive perimeter. The good news is that his contribution on that end is not terribly different from Thompson's at age 34 after two major leg injuries. The five-time All-Star's defense was a liability for the Warriors, as his defensive rating of 116.1 last season was slightly worse than Hield's 115.7.\n\nFor years, the Warriors didn't have to plan for that problem with Thompson, who freed up Curry by taking the tougher backcourt assignment. While Hield would fill the shooting role vacated by Thompson, Steve Kerr may prefer to start a stronger defender alongside Curry and bring Hield off the bench to avoid placing more of a defensive burden on his 36-year-old star guard.", "source": {"uri": "eastbaytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Bay Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_nowels@eastbaytimes.com", "name": "Michael Nowels", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Nurse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Nurse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BNG-L-WARRIORS-0704-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Hield, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft, split last season between the Indiana Pacers and the 76ers after a midseason trade. Now, if Golden State can complete this trade, he will move to the Bay Area and join a very fitting team.\n\nThe Warriors have been led by the Splash Brothers, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, for the past 13 years. That duo split up when free agency began and Thompson joined the Dallas Mavericks. That left the Warriors with a need for more 3-point shooting, but very few players in league history are capable of making 3's at the volume that Thompson did.\n\nWell, Hield is one of them. In all of NBA history, there have been 22 individual seasons in which a player made at least 270 3-pointers. Nine of them belong to Curry. Two belong to Thompson. And, amazingly, four belong to Hield, more than anyone else in that group besides Curry. He has made exactly 40% of his 3-pointers in the NBA on 7.6 attempts per game. Thompson shoots the same volume at 7.6 attempts per game, but is slightly more efficient at 41.3%. Hield is the closest thing the Warriors could have found to a new Splash Brother. Hield has never been Thompson's equal as a defender, but Thompson's decline in that regard was steep.\n\nThe Warriors have spent the early portion of this offseason remaking their roster with the goal of building a cheaper team. They waived Chris Paul and let Thompson walk, but have added De'Anthony Melton through the non-taxpayer mid-level exception and Kyle Anderson through a sign-and-trade. In Hield, they would be finding a player meant to replace some of Thompson's shooting volume, whereas Melton and Anderson add defense and playmaking, respectively. The Warriors are also reportedly being aggressive in attempting to land Utah Jazz star Lauri Markkanen, and given the talent drain of the past few years here, another star is probably needed for the Warriors to seriously contend for a fifth championship since 2015.\n\nOnly time will tell if they can actually do so, but Hield would be a valuable role player on a contending team.

The aim of the dialogue has been to \"finalize\" a sign-and-trade for 3-point specialist Buddy Hield.\n\nAn eight-year NBA veteran, Hield ranks 10th among active players in total career 3s (1,924). He's one of 13 active players shooting at least 40 percent from 3 for their career, a list that includes Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. He's also an NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest champion, winning in 2020.\n\nUltimately, Hield will replace Thompson, who left the Warriors for the Dallas Mavericks this week.\n\nThompson has the advantage on Hield in terms of stature, with Hield just 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds. Thompson's shooting release is a shade quicker. Though he's not necessarily more likely to, Hield is more capable of scoring off-the-dribble at this stage of his career, as he's unhindered by injury complications.\n\nNonetheless, the similarities in their strengths and shot profiles are overwhelming. In fact, Hield is even more of a 3-point specialist than Thompson. Over the past three seasons, 58.1 percent of Thompson's field goal attempts have come from beyond the arc, whereas Hield has a 65.7 percent 3-point attempt rate in that span. So, when it comes to finding a player who they can put into Thompson's offensive role, he's as good as it gets.\n\nAn underrated aspect of Hield's arrival is his willingness to accept a bench role.\n\nOf course, most players will admit to wanting to start. While there will always be players who are more comfortable coming off the bench, it's more or less understood that being in the starting five comes with a level of prestige. This, in some ways, was the source of Thompson's chagrin. A part of him understood that his physical decline made him a defensive liability in the first unit. However, his pride was wounded by being relegated to the bench, especially in favor of a rookie.\n\nAfter all, he helped make Golden State 'the Warriors.'\n\nHield would undoubtedly love starting beside Curry. Nonetheless, if Warriors head coach seems it better for him to be in the second unit, he will. Hield simply wants his talents to be appreciated. No franchise appreciates the art of the 3 more than Golden State.\n\nIf Hield does start, it'll probably be because he's taken more pride in playing defense the last three seasons.\n\nHe's added muscle in order to guard small forwards, aware that he isn't the best at shading shiftier players. If Golden State trades for Hield without giving up a player like Andrew Wiggins, he could start. This could lead to cross-matches when Wiggins guards opposing shooting guards, as he'll likely draw a forward defender. If so, it'll enhance Warriors' transition offense, with teams scrambling to find their man.\n\nWith that being said, Golden State generated a sizable trade exception when they executed a sign-and-trade with the Mavs for Thompson. With it, they may be able to absorb Hield's salary without giving up a player.", "source": {"uri": "lastwordonsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Last Word on Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "quenton_s_albertie@lastwordonsports.com", "name": "Quenton S Albertie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiggins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Wiggins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://lastwordonsports.com/basketball/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/IMG_9690.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

He appeared in 32 games with the Sixers to close the regular season, but was limited to spot duty in the playoffs, when he averaged just 5.5 points in just less than 13 minutes per night.\n\n\"It's unclear if Golden State would be sending out any salary in the proposed sign-and-trade,\" wrote Luke Adams of Hoops Rumors. \"There are ways for the team to pull it off with little to no outgoing money as long as Hield's starting salary isn't too high, but moving off an expiring contract -- such as Gary Payton II and/or Kevon Looney -- would give the Warriors more flexibility under their first-apron hard cap and could allow for a more lucrative contract for Hield.\"", "source": {"uri": "fanbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL | NCAA | NBA |  WWE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_amico@fanbuzz.com", "name": "Sam Amico", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Payton_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Payton II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevon_Looney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevon Looney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://fanbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/hield.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

While fans mourn his exit, the front office is looking for a replacement and has reportedly zeroed in on Buddy Hield to take Thompson's place in the starting lineup.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Shams Charania, the Warriors are discussing a deal with the Philadelphia 76ers to land the 31-year-old guard. He reported,\n\n\"The Golden State Warriors are in serious talks on a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Buddy Hield. Warriors and 76ers have been in deep discussions, working to finalize the deal for one of the NBA's best three-point shooters.\"\n\nCharania's report suggests there's a high possibility that Hield will ply his trade for the Warriors next season. The 76ers traded for the guard in February, hoping he'd help boost their bid to venture deep into the Eastern Conference playoffs. However, he did not have the impact they hoped for. Hield played 36 games for the franchise and averaged 11 points, three rebounds, and 2.8 assists.\n\nThe 76ers felt he was surplus to requirements and let him test free agency. He remains unsigned but the Warriors are willing to negotiate a sign-and-trade deal with Philadelphia to land the veteran.\n\nStylistically, Hield is an ideal replacement for Thompson. Like the four-time NBA champion, the former 76ers guard is one of the best three-point shooters in the league. He's a career 40% shooter from beyond the arc, a stunning conversion rate that perfectly fits the Warriors' ethos. They're hoping to wrap this deal quickly but will be wary that it could fall through considering their failed attempt to land Paul George via a sign-and-trade offer.\n\nThe Warriors tried to land the veteran forward to soften the blow of Thompson's exit. However, the Clippers felt their offer wasn't up to the mark and opted to retain financial flexibility, allowing the forward to test free agency. Ironically, he signed a four-year, $212 million deal with the 76ers, ending Hield's hopes of extending his stay in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Warriors did not let their failed pursuit of George deter their offseason plans. They moved on quickly and signed another former 76ers guard, De'Anthony Melton, to a one-year deal. Their second attempt at a sign-and-trade went swimmingly as they landed forward Kyle Anderson from the Minnesota Timberwolves for a future second-round pick swap and cash considerations.\n\nIn addition to Hield, the Warriors are reportedly interested in Utah Jazz star Lauri Markkanen. The 27-year-old forward would be a stellar addition to the roster but will likely cost the team a fortune. For now, the Warriors are focused on landing Thompson's replacement in the starting lineup and are seemingly close.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prateek_singh@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Prateek Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De'Anthony_Melton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De'Anthony Melton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauri_Markkanen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lauri Markkanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/0c544808-untitled-design-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Or, he can at least fill a big part of it.\n\nThe former Oklahoma Sooners star shot 38.6 percent from distance last season during his time with the Sixers and Indiana Pacers while also scoring 12.1 points per contest. Hield's reliability would also be key for a Warriors squad that gets bit by the injury and suspension bugs on occasion.

Mandatory Credit: Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports / Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers seem to be talking shop with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAs free agency passes through the first wave moves, the Sixers could find themselves cutting ties with their notable trade acquisition from last season.\n\nWhile Buddy Hield was a candidate to leave the Sixers in the open market -- leaving them losing him for nothing -- it turns out Philadelphia could get something in return for the veteran sharpshooter.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Shams Charania, the Warriors and the Sixers have been \"in serious talks\" on a potential sign-and-trade involving Hield. Over the next few days, the Sixers could have a new asset or two, while the Warriors would acquire one of the league's most efficient three-point shooters.\n\nWhen the Sixers initially traded for Hield back in February, they hoped there could be a long-term fit. With Philadelphia desiring a high-volume three-point shooter, Hield's skillset is exactly what Nick Nurse's system needed. Unfortunately, the on-court sample wasn't as great as on paper.\n\nFollowing a tenure with the Indiana Pacers, Hield was off to a hot start with the Sixers. Over time, he began playing himself out of the rotation.\n\nBy the end of the 2023-2024 regular season, Hield clocked 32 games, 14 of which were starts. In an average of 25 minutes, Hield produced 12 points per game, shooting 39 percent from deep on seven attempts per game.\n\nEvery trade the Sixers make at the deadline is struck with intentions of snagging a impact player for the upcoming playoff run. Although Hield lacked postseason experience, the Sixers believed his game would translate well. But in two of six games, Hield was a healthy scratch. In the four games he played, Hield averaged just 12 minutes, averaging five points as he took fewer than five shots per game.\n\nHield seemed open to a return to the Sixers at the end of the postseason. 76ers President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey was open to a reunion for next year, but he was quite honest about the Hield addition not panning out the way the team had hoped.\n\nThe Warriors just might value Hield more than the Sixers at this time. Therefore, the two squads are expected to work out an arrangement to send the sharpshooter out West to join his fifth team since 2016.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zavier_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zavier Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedExForum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FedExForum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Morey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daryl Morey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3461,h_1946,x_0,y_52/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_76ers/01j1wh4n3633ffwyhx0m.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Over the course of his eight-year career, Hield has knocked down 40.0% of 7.6 three-point attempts per game.\n\nIn 2023/24, Hield appeared in a league-high 84 regular season games, exceeding the typical 82-game limit as a result of a midseason trade that sent him from Indiana to Philadelphia. He averaged 12.1 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 2.8 assists in 25.7 minutes per game for the Pacers and Sixers, with a .386 3PT%.\n\nHield's elite shooting made him the No. 24 free agent on our top-50 list, though as I wrote within that article, his game doesn't really stand out in many other areas. His value also took a bit of a hit this year, as he was essentially dumped for non-rotation players and a couple second-round picks by a Pacers team that eventually made it to the Eastern Conference finals, then barely saw the court in the Sixers' first-round playoff series vs. New York.\n\nStill, depending on the cost - in terms of both his salary and the piece(s) going to Philadelphia - that outside shot could make him a worthwhile investment for the Warriors.\n\nIt's unclear if Golden State would be sending out any salary in the proposed sign-and-trade. There are ways for the team to pull it off with little to no outgoing money as long as Hield's starting salary isn't too high, but moving off an expiring contract - such as Gary Payton II and/or Kevon Looney - would give the Warriors more flexibility under their first-apron hard cap and could allow for a more lucrative contract for Hield. A third team might be required in that scenario if the Sixers aren't interested in taking on salary from the Warriors.

Mandatory Credit: Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Golden State Warriors might have lost a key piece but the team has no plans of taking their foot off the gas. While it was heartbreaking to see Klay Thompson leave the team, the franchise is wasting no time in replacing the sharpshooter this offseason. According to NBA Insider Shams Charania, the Warriors already have their eye on Buddy Hield.\n\nRevealing the news on The Rally, the analyst said,\n\n\"I'm told the Golden State Warriors are working to finalize a sign-and-trade to get Buddy Hield from the Philadelphia 76ers. Ever since they lost Klay Thompson to the Dallas Mavericks, the Warriors have really targeted Buddy Heild.\"\n\nThe Warriors front office is planning to bring Hield and Kyle Anderson to the team, along with D'Anthony Melton as a backup guard. Talking about the Hield's relevance to the squad, Charania said,\n\n\"[Buddy Hield]Him and Steph Curry are the two top three-point leaders over the last five seasons in the mix across the entire NBA. They already got Kyle Anderson in a sign-and-trade with Minnesota.\"\n\nBringing the former Pacer to the roster would immediately fill the void that Thompson left. He is a proven shooter, averaging 40% from the three-point line.\n\nAs for Anderson, widely referred to as 'Slow Mo', he excels in slowing down the pace of the game and using it to his advantage. Though the Warriors already have enough for the forward position, let's see how Steve Kerr utilizes Anderson's skillset.\n\nWhile the Warriors have already signed three new players in Thompson's salary portion, the team is also rumored to be in talks with the Utah Jazz. They are reportedly targeting the All-Star forward, Lauri Markannen.\n\nMarkannen has been producing some of his best years in the league. He was selected for his first All-Star game last season and also took home the Most Improved Player award.\n\nThe 7ft forward is a big man that excels at spacing the floor. A 37.5% three-pointer shooter for his career, Markannen's shooting numbers appear even more impressive for his size and frame. The decisions of who's going to start and who comes up off the bench will be a tough one on Kerr. Will he be able to make the right move?", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_dhariwal@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Abhishek Dhariwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Improved_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Improved Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/fcd7c0f0-untitled-design-32.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-01-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Why 76ers trade isn't Warriors' best option to fill Splash Brother role", "body": "Klay Thompson's Warriors legacy will never be replaced, but Golden State will have to move on because the league stops for no one.\n\nThe Warriors already made two moves to fill Thompson and Chris Paul's minutes, bringing in De'Anthony Melton and Kyle Anderson on mid-tier contracts. Another one may be in the works. Golden State is in \"serious talks\" to land Buddy Hield in a sign-and-trade. It would likely take some of the second-round pick capital that the franchise gained in trading Thompson, per Yahoo's Jake Fischer.\n\nCould Hield, Melton and Anderson be upgrades from Thompson and Paul? Here's how the team could look next year.\n\nMORE: Free agency grades for all 30 NBA teams\n\nHield looked like a quality starter throughout his tenure in Indiana, averaging 15.4 points per game on 40.2 percent shooting from 3 over two and a half seasons. He couldn't quite find that same groove in Philadelphia, where his regular season scoring dropped to 12.2 per game. His role fell substantially in the playoffs, but he did drop 20 points and keep the 76ers competitive in their elimination game against the Knicks in the first round.\n\nOne thing that will never change about Hield's game is that he's going to find a way to fire off a ton of 3s. His 12.6 attempts per 100 possessions ranked 12th in the league last season, slightly below Thompson's 14.7. (Curry led the league with 17.5.) Hield has been in the top 15 in each of the past five years. He's a 40 percent career shooter from deep, so those are great shots for a team.\n\nThere is more to shooting 3s than simply getting them up and hitting them. What made Thompson such a dangerous player for the Warriors was his shooting off movement. He was still a great pull-up 3-point shooter last season, hitting 41.4 percent of his attempts. Hield was nowhere near that mark, hitting only 30.2 percent last season. But he did hit 43.8 percent in 2022-23.\n\nThe movement sets that Hield has been used in throughout his career should translate directly to Golden State, as pointed out by NBA analyst Joe Viray.\n\nThompson has also been a willing cutter, getting the occasional dive to the rim off Golden State's split-cut action. Hield doesn't cut nearly as much. He does finish them at a good rate, though, ranking in the 63rd percentile of players.\n\nBoth players are not considered good defenders. Thompson at one time was an All-Defensive talent. These days, he has trouble staying in front of speedier guards. Hield has seen his role fluctuate throughout his career because of weak defense.\n\nMORE: Draymond Green reveals he almost left Warriors, reacts to Klay Thompson trade\n\nMelton isn't as big of a name as Thompson or Hield, but he might be the best player out of the three. He's a great two-way guard with ball-hawking instincts and tough point-of-attack defense. He's not an advantage creator and he's a weak finisher at the rim, but he has turned into a reliable 38.3 percent 3-point shooter over the past four years of his career. He doesn't offer nearly the shooting versatility of Thompson or Hield, but he can hit the open ones.\n\nThe Warriors were able to grab Melton on a bargain one-year, $12.8 million contract. He was in line for a much bigger payday, but back injuries limited his effectiveness last season. If he can get back into his form from two seasons ago, he is a great fit for Golden State. He's a smart player who fits well into Steve Kerr's read-and-react system.\n\nMelton can't shoot it like Thompson, but he does other more important things. He's a great help defender and a better rebounder than Thompson. He won't get blown by on the perimeter nearly as much. And his shot selection will be better.\n\nMORE: Why Klay Thompson chose Mavericks over Lakers\n\nThe Warriors need a very specific type of player to play in their system. Talented players like Kelly Oubre Jr. look terrible if they can't make high-level reads or play off Curry.\n\nAnderson is one of the smarter players in the league and a great passer. He sets good screens within the flow of an offense, and he will help get Curry quality looks. He's also a versatile defender who will make Golden State better on that side of the floor.\n\nAnderson isn't going to help out Golden State's transition attack. He's one of the slowest players in the league. His shot also has a comically long release, and he's a career 33.8 percent shooter from the perimeter. Even so, this is an ideal place to hide those weaknesses, and a $9 million average value for a good rotation player is a bargain.\n\nIt stings to lose Thompson, but the reality is that he was no longer worth the money last season. The three new players that the Warriors brought in to replace him should make them better, and Thompson will have a much better role in Dallas where he can simply catch and shoot off passes from Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De'Anthony_Melton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De'Anthony Melton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Oubre_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Oubre Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/Buddy%20Hield%20USA%20070324_0.jpeg?itok=wSaqfNyg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

But doing so -- offering the 34 year-old small forward out of Fresno, a $212M four-year contract, has left them in a bit of a cap crunch. They were able to lock up Tyrese Maxey on a $204M deal of his own, one that the first-time All-Star deserved.\n\nBut the reason the team was able to sign PG in the first place was because they didn't take on any long-term salary either last offseason, or around the 2024 NBA Trade Deadline.\n\nOur Paul Hudrick wrote about the guts it took Daryl Morey to thread the needle there, doing what it took to help the team last season, without costing themselves the chance to pursue bigger fish last week.\n\nOne \"needle-thread\" move they did make, however, was when they acquired former Kings, and Pacers guard, Buddy Hield last February. Hield had his moments in a Sixers' uni, but once Joel Embiid went down with a torn meniscus, he didn't really deliver what coach Nick Nurse was hoping for.\n\nAnd now it appears as if the Bahama Mamba may be departing for the Golden State Warriors.\n\nPer Shams Charania, of The Athletic and FanDuelTV:\n\nWe've yet to get more details, but you can be sure that Philadelphia would love to recoup any type of asset, even if it were merely a future second-round pick or a trade exception.\n\nWe won't expect miracles here but anything like that would be better than letting Hield, acquired for a couple of second-round picks, (while also parting ways with Marcus Morris, Sr. and Furkan Korkmaz in a three team trade that also included the San Antonio Spurs) walk for nothing return.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors recently bid fairwell to future Hall of Famer, Klay Thompson, a four-time champion with The Dubs, so apparently their newish front office wanted to bolster the shooters that Steph Curry can work with.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, current Warrior, Draymond Green shared his thoughts on the Warriors push to land Paul George that fell apart when the Clippers didn't want to play ball with a Conference rival. That was just one of the things Daryl Morey and the Sixers needed to go their way.\n\nPhilly still has a few first-rounders and some cap space to work with. There was recently a report from Hoops Hype's Michael Scotto that Philadelphia could be interested in acquiring Brooklyn Nets' wing Dorian Finney-Smith, or potentially Warriors' Lester Quinones.\n\nSo we'll see if LQ might not be exchanged for Hield. The Sixers have already had sad goodbyes with De'Anthony Melton (a Warrior) and Nico Batum (a Clipper once again).

To build a superteam around Steph Curry for the upcoming season, the Warriors need to bring in star power. Here are three potential targets for the Warriors this offseason.\n\nKevin Durant\n\nKevin Durant became an unrestricted free agent on July 1. As multiple title contenders are already eyeing him, the Warriors have a prime opportunity to bring Durant to Golden State.\n\nMeanwhile, Warriors executive Jerry West recently had a phone conversation with Durant. What's more, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Warriors players have been in communication with Durant throughout the season.\n\nBrandon Ingram\n\nBrandon Ingram is frequently mentioned in trade rumors, and for good reason. He is coming off a stellar season, averaging 20.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 5.7 assists. Ingram's athleticism and scoring ability could fill the void left by Thompson, pairing effectively with Curry to maintain Golden State Warriors's offensive firepower.\n\nEric Gordon\n\nEric Gordon will opt out of his contract with the Phoenix Suns, becoming an unrestricted free agent. Gordon is known for his offensive capabilities, and he could be a valuable addition to the Warriors. The former 2016-17 Sixth Man of the Year averaged 16.0 points, 2.8 assists, and 2.4 rebounds while shooting 37.1% from deep.\n\nThe Athletic's Shams Charania has recently shared that the Golden State Warriors are reportedly in \"serious talks\" with the Philadelphia 76ers about a sign-and-trade deal involving Buddy Hield.\n\n\"The Golden State Warriors are in serious talks on a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Buddy Hield, league sources tell @TheAthletic@Stadium. Warriors and 76ers have been in deep discussions, working to finalize the deal for one of the NBA's best three-point shooters,\" Charania shared on his X account.\n\nHield has garnered attention for his three-point shooting prowess, making him a valuable addition to the Warriors' roster. If the deal goes through, he could potentially fill the void left by Klay Thompson. He can also provide significant support for Stephen Curry in the upcoming season.\n\nAlso Read: VIDEO: Draymond Green Looks Back on the Glory Days With Klay Thompson as the Warriors' Era Comes to an End.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shabiha_akter@totalprosports.com", "name": "Shabiha Akter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Ingram", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Ingram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Sixth_Man_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2148349169-scaled-e1719981981470.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 402, "textEnd": 408}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

While the job's not yet done, even at this juncture, any rational mind would hoist the franchise up as a success story this offseason.\n\nAs you already know though, their newfound success can be a bit alienating, especially since last season was one riddled with questions coming from everywhere. One move in particular was a huge mistake, and a rumored trade close to its finishing touches is an admission that the 76ers indeed made a miscalculation.\n\n76ers admit huge mistake as they inch closer to shocking Buddy Hield trade\n\nAccording to the latest on the free agent market, the Warriors are finalizing a sign-and-trade that would net them Buddy Hield from the 76ers. Philly has not been reported to have any interest in bringing the veteran sharpshooter back, and it seems like Golden State is zeroing in on him as a replacement for Klay Thompson, who has now departed the franchise.\n\nThanks to his regressed play last season, especially in the playoffs, there was a realistic chance that the 76ers can re-sign Hield on a relative discount. However, that has been far from reality, with the front office even facilitating his exit and foray into the Western Conference.\n\nPhiladelphia flipped a total of three second-round picks to obtain Hield at the trade deadline in a three-team trade with Indiana and San Antonio, and it's safe to say that the move didn't pan out. It was certainly a short-sighted one, albeit by design, but that the team had to dangle away all those assets ultimately proved to be a mistake.\n\nHield became unplayable when it mattered the most, and the 76ers basically realized they traded for a half-season rental of a player who only played well before the All-Star break. Thankfully, this has become one of the impetuses behind the front office avoiding one-dimensional players this summer as they create a legitimate title contender.\n\nAs of speaking, the trade hasn't been finalized just yet with Hield still needing to come to full terms with the Warriors on his contract.

That, perhaps, would allow them to combine his salary and Paul Reed's to acquire a player not attainable with Reed's salary alone, such as Cleveland's Caris LeVert or Sacramento's Kevin Huerter.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Reed_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Reed (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Huerter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Huerter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caris_LeVert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caris LeVert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/4V28798D4yCU_2u9mK58XyU8z_1440x1046.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

While Thompson may not be the All-Star he once was, he still was second on the team in scoring (17.9 points per game) and knocked down 38.7 percent of his threes on nine attempts per game.\n\nFilling that void wasn't going to be easy, but on Thursday the Warriors were able to land the best pure shooter on the market to help replace what was lost in that area with Thompson's departure, agreeing to a sign-and-trade with the Sixers to bring in Buddy Hield. Hield will be brought into the trade exception created in the Thompson deal, and will send one of the second round picks they acquired for Klay to Philly.\n\nThe contract for Hield is fairly complex as it is technically a 4-year deal, but only two are guaranteed, with a partial guarantee on the third year and a player option for a non-guaranteed fourth year.\n\nHield never quite found his footing as part of the Sixers rotation last season, as he was not much of a factor for them by the time they reached the postseason, but he did shoot 38.6 percent from three on 6.8 attempts per game last season in Indiana and Philadelphia, and will bring some needed floor spacing to the Warriors backcourt rotation. Hield will likely fill the bench shooting role the Warriors envisioned for Thompson this season, as Brandin Podziemski figures to take the starting two-guard spot.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "megan_armstrong@uproxx.com", "name": "Megan Armstrong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "grant_sharples@uproxx.com", "name": "Grant Sharples", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Hoosiers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/buddy-hield.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702242", "eventUri": "eng-9702242", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 457814415, "relevance": 2}

{"id": 225054492, "title": "Barcelona confirm Hansi Flick as head coach on two-year contract", "text": "Barcelona have appointed former Germany and Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick as their head coach on a two-year contract. Flick, who has not managed a club since being sacked by Germany in September 2023, will be tasked with reviving Barcelona\u2019s fortunes after they failed to win a trophy this season under Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, who was dismissed on Friday. Barcelona said in a statement announcing Flick\u2019s appointment: \u201cFC Barcelona have chosen a man well known for his teams\u2019 high pressing, intense and daring style of play which has brought him great success at club level and international level, winning pretty much all there is to win in the world of football.\u201d Flick\u2019s trophies with Bayern included a Champions League and two Bundesliga titles. He guided Bayern to a treble in 2020, when they beat Barcelona 8-2 on course to winning the Champions League, and left in 2021 to manage Germany. He had been the assistant to Joachim L\u00f6w when Germany won the World Cup in 2014. Xavi took charge of his final Barcelona game on Sunday, having been told two days earlier that he would not be staying beyond the end of the season, and afterwards issued a stark message.\u201cTo the new manager, I tell you: you will suffer,\u201d Xavi said. \u201cThis is a very complicated place to be. This is a difficult job and you have to be patient.\u201d", "summary": "<ul><li>Former Bayern Munich manager replaces Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez</li><li>He has not worked since sacking by Germany in September 2023</li></ul><p>Barcelona have appointed former Germany and Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick as their head coach on a two-year contract.</p><p>Flick, who has not managed a club since being sacked by Germany in September 2023, will be tasked with reviving Barcelona\u2019s fortunes after they failed to win a trophy this season under Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/24/barcelona-hansi-flick-coach-xavi\">was dismissed</a> on Friday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/29/barcelona-confirm-hansi-flick-as-head-coach\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/29/barcelona-confirm-hansi-flick-as-head-coach", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ee02d2bb86bb337db186f04c9463ae0003a8229/0_279_4061_2437/master/4061.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:01:38", "author": "Guardian Sport,Reuters and Guardian sport", "authors": ["Guardian Sport", "Reuters and Guardian sport"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.199}

But somewhere along the way, the messaging became garbled. It was no longer, \u201cYou can have it all,\u201d but \u201cYou\u2019re expected to do it all.\u201d What I see today is a generation of women who are more professionally successful than any that came before them. Over the past 50 years, women\u2019s earnings have risen dramatically, with the percentage of women in heterosexual marriages who earn as much or more than their husbands tripling in the last 50 years. This is great news for women, but the problem is, we haven\u2019t traded domestic for professional work. We\u2019ve simply added more to our plates. And we are more burned out than any generation before, with U.S. women reporting burnout 32% more than their male counterparts. America Ferrera\u2019s speech in the Barbie movie summed it up for millions of American women. So what can working women do? Heading back to 1950 isn\u2019t an option, and I doubt many of us, especially those of us of color, would want to return to that time period anyway. What we can do is embrace solutions that allow us to have what\u2019s important to us\u2014without compromising our sanity.

If you don\u2019t have the resources to follow these suggestions to the letter, see if you can tailor them to what is available to you. Believe me, I\u2019ve been there. As the child of immigrant parents, money was always scarce growing up. This is how I learned the importance of enlisting others for support.) 1. Outsource at the office and at home. As your professional success grows, recalibrate where your skills and time will achieve the greatest ROI. What is the opportunity cost of doing mundane tasks when you could be growing your business or creating memories with your family? Incrementally outsource things you don\u2019t enjoy or that hinder your growth at work and at home. Grocery delivery, a weekly house cleaner and a virtual assistant can make a tremendous difference in your quality of life. Time is our most valuable resource. Anything you can do to buy it back is well worth the money. 2. Loosen the control grip. I\u2019m type A. I want to have control over everything. But if you want to have it all, you have to loosen your grip on control. Last year, I was bottlenecking my team because everything needed my approval. I realized I had to let go and transfer my knowledge to others who could approve projects in my stead. This slowed things down in the short term, but once they were trained, I never had to worry about those tasks again. 3. Prioritize Your Glass Balls. Coca-Cola\u2019s CEO Bryan Dyson gave a commencement speech that included the \u201c5 Balls of Life\u201d metaphor. He said that life is about juggling 5 balls: work, family, health, friends and spirit. Work is a rubber ball\u2013if you drop it, it will bounce back. But the other balls are glass. Drop one of them, and it can \u201cbe irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered.\u201d I\u2019ve found I can only prioritize what\u2019s important if it\u2019s built into my schedule. Between 4 and 8 p.m. every night is family time, set on my calendar like a business meeting. Kids activities, field trips, and dates with my husband are all added to my calendar first, then I schedule everything else. 4. Add layers to your management onion. As your business grows, add new layers to your management team to remove burdens from your shoulders. While it will temporarily decrease your margins, it will pay off. Building a business is a marathon, not a sprint. Management layers allowed me to eject myself from certain areas so I could start working more on my business rather than in the business. 5. Bring your business skills home. Successful professionals know how to plan, execute, innovate and iterate. These skills can help you get the most out of home life, too. My husband and I do annual planning for our family just like we would with our businesses, asking what we want to accomplish, how we want to grow and what memories we want to make. Aligning on our personal goals helps us streamline our busy lives and show up better for one another. 6. You can do anything for 20 minutes. When your schedule is tight, you may be tempted to procrastinate, thinking if you don\u2019t have to complete a task, why start? I\u2019ve found a trick. See what you can get done in 20 minutes. A lot of time, you can make serious progress in a head-down 20-minute sprint. 7. Give up on perfection. Women tend to be perfectionists. It bothers us when things don\u2019t get done. We think our partners and children expect perfection, but that\u2019s a fallacy. We do this to ourselves. If you want to have it all, it won\u2019t all be picture perfect. That\u2019s okay. Done is better than perfect, and sometimes undone is best. Frankly, the life of a mom entrepreneur is very messy behind the scenes. 9. Know your kids are happiest when you\u2019re happy. Mom guilt is real. Before I leave for a business trip, I\u2019ll find myself cooking my kids\u2019 favorite meals out of preliminary guilt. I accept these feelings as part of being a loving mom, but I don\u2019t let them run me into the ground. The truth is, kids are happiest when they see their parents happy. My kids see me working hard and accomplishing things, and I think that\u2019s great modeling for them. My son and my daughter both need to understand that women are capable of doing whatever they want with their lives. We Should Be Proud Of All We Do As women, we need to give ourselves some grace. Where we carry guilt for not \u201cdoing it all,\u201d we should instead take pride in all that we do. By saying no and doing less, we can show up more for the things important to us. My success as a female entrepreneur didn't come overnight. It's been decades in the making by prioritizing one professional and personal milestone at a time and leaning on those around me for support with my rubber balls.

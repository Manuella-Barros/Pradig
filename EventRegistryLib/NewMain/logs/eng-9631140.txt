Now, she's finally getting the chance to call the NBA's biggest series.\n\nHighlights Doris Burke makes history as the first woman to call a major U.S. Men's Championship game on TV. Burke has been a basketball announcing mainstay for 30 years, excelling in various broadcasting roles. Known for her incredible work, Burke is now a marquee name and will call the NBA Finals with Breen and Redick.\n\nThere is plenty of history being made in the 2024 NBA Finals, from all-time great players establishing their legacies to players making Hall of Fame bids, or coaches trying to prove themselves as leaders. However, another type of groundbreaking history will be made in the announcer's booth.\n\nESPN's Doris Burke will become the first woman to call a major U.S. Men's Championship when she opens the telecast of NBA Finals Game 1 alongside Mike Breen and J.J. Redick. This accomplishment has been a long time coming, both for women and Burke herself, after doing great work in various places across the basketball universe.\n\nBurke Has Been An Announcing Mainstay For 30 years Working at ESPN since 1991, she has elevated to the top of the broadcasting heap\n\nDoris Burke is a basketball lifer, in the purest sense of the term. She was an excellent college basketball player at Providence College from 1984 to 1897, earning two All-Big-East selections as well as an All-American spot in 1987. She led the conference in assists as a freshman and left Providence as their all-time leader in dimes, eventually being inducted into the Providence Hall of Fame.\n\nShe built on this success by immediately moving into the broadcasting space in 1990. Burke called Big East women's and men's basketball games, WNBA games, and was the primary radio voice for the New York Liberty for several years. In 2003, she began working for ESPN's men's college basketball, as well as working on NBA pregame shows and as a sideline reporter.\n\nIn 2017, Burke earned a job as a main broadcaster for ESPN's NBA games, becoming one of the marquee names in the basketball announcing space. She has quickly become one of the more iconic voices of the last decade of NBA action, working in several incredible booths over the past seven years.\n\nAfter announcing the NBA Finals and Conference Finals on the radio for several years, Burke was elevated to the main ESPN announcing team upon the departure of Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson.

Now, she's on the cusp of history. - The Boston Globe", "body": "Burke, 58, will make history this week as the first woman to call a championship telecast in a major American men's sports league. Colleagues say her gig as a ESPN and ABC color announcer for the NBA Finals is the culmination of decades of preparation.\n\nA standout basketball player at Providence who still calls Rhode Island home, the Hall-of-Fame broadcaster never lost her point guard's eye for details. People close to Burke say that shows up in the trust she builds with coaches and players, and her ability to communicate even the smallest details to millions of viewers.\n\n\"The point guard position is a great one from which to attack this business, because your responsibility as point guard is to know the strengths and weaknesses of every one of your teammates,\" Burke said in an interview. \"It's to know the game plan on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nNow, as the Celtics prepare to face the Mavericks on Thursday, Burke isn't shying away from this important moment for women in sports broadcasting.\n\n\"I'm closer to the end than the beginning of my career,\" Burke said. \"There are so many gifted and talented women in professional sports doing their jobs at high levels. If, in fact, something I have done has made their life easier, than there would be nothing more meaningful that I have achieved in my career than that.\"\n\nAmong Burke's disciples is Cassidy Hubbarth, her colleague at ESPN who also covers the NBA. Hubbarth called Burke a \"trailblazer\" who has climbed the ranks of a male-dominated industry saturated with ex-NBA players and coaches.\n\n\"She's freely admitted that she's had many moments of imposter syndrome,\" Hubbarth said. \"When you see someone like that -- who you have the utmost respect for, who you strive to be like -- be able to relate to on that level, that is invaluable.\"\n\nBurke discovered basketball as a child in Manasquan, N.J. She recalled seeing a boy dribbling a basketball between his legs without losing control, sparking her ball-handling obsession.\n\n\"I feel like I picked the ball up at seven years of age and I haven't put it down since,\" Burke said.\n\nAt Providence, Burke was \"scrappy\" on defense and brought an intense edge, according to her former teammate Sheila Harrity.\n\n\"You never wanted to be on the receiving end of a high five because your hand would sting for many minutes after,\" Harrity said.\n\nAfter graduating in 1987, Burke joined the coaching staff before stepping back to help raise her family. She was a stay-home mom in 1990 when a local radio station was looking for someone to call Friars women's basketball games. The athletic director asked Burke, who said yes.\n\nBurke described herself as shy and quiet off the court, which didn't naturally translate to being an on-air analyst. She joked that she didn't have many listeners.\n\nBut someone was listening.\n\nBurke began to draw interest from other broadcasts and was soon calling games for NESN, ESPN, and other networks. In 1997, Burke said, she got an unexpected call from Mike Gorman. The Celtics play-by-play announcer, who retired this year, urged her to get involved with the nascent WNBA.\n\nBurke started calling games for the New York Liberty on the radio, then moved to TV, and eventually filled in to call a Knicks game.\n\n\"That was an enormous break,\" Burke said.\n\nAs she rose to call college basketball tournaments and the NBA, so did her reputation as an astute observer of the game. Coaches took notice.\n\n\"She came in with notes. She was prepared,\" said Bucks coach Doc Rivers, who led the Celtics to their last title in 2008. \"You can tell she did her homework, and coaches really appreciate that.\"\n\nShe has an eye for the intangibles -- pointing out players' positioning, footwork, and hustle.\n\n\"She might ask me about pick angles and things that most people wouldn't want to know,\" said Rivers, who worked with Burke and Mike Breen on ESPN before taking the Bucks job in January.\n\nAdmiration of Burke stretches across the media world. Jackie MacMullan, a former Globe Sports columnist and ESPN senior writer, said Burke is \"at the top of her game\" and \"always has been.\" New Yorker editor David Remnick has called Burke \"the smartest\" voice in basketball.\n\nBut Burke is quick to deflect the praise elsewhere. She quickly turns from her own accomplishments to Breen and JJ Redick, who will call the Finals with Burke on ABC. She called Redick a \"brilliant\" broadcaster and Breen a \"master of the play by play position.\"\n\n\"She's tremendously generous with her partners,\" said O'Brien. \"She's a point guard at heart. She wants the team to win -- she doesn't care who gets the credit for it.\"\n\nHer selflessness extends most to her family. Burke has two children with her ex-husband, Greg Burke, who is the head golf coach at the University of Rhode Island. She has one home just outside of Philadelphia near her daughter Sarah and her two grandchildren, and another in Rhode Island close to her son Matthew.\n\nBurke said the biggest challenge in her career has been not being present for key moments of her kids' lives. She remembered how, just minutes before tip-off of a women's college basketball national championship game, her daughter Sarah called her about her first true breakup.\n\n\"I couldn't hold my daughter on that particular day. You have to get your mind right back to the task at hand which is calling a national championship,\" Burke said. \"That was a challenge.\"\n\nThat's a hardship for many working mothers, and fathers too. It's even harder while climbing the ranks of basketball broadcasting.\n\n\"We were both young mothers trying to navigate that in a pretty competitive world where you had to travel a lot and you had to figure out how to balance home and work,\" said MacMullan of her and Burke. \"I hardly knew anybody that had that same challenge.\"\n\nBurke previously worked the NBA Finals on TV but was a sideline reporter, a lower profile but key role interviewing coaches, players, and reporting on injuries.\n\nHer colleagues and her friends are proud of this moment and feel it's fitting that it's Burke.\n\nHubbarth said it \"was always supposed to be her.\" Rivers quoted a longtime saying of his mom: \"you're right where you're supposed to be.\" And former Providence teammate Joanie Kostacopoulos called it \"poetic.\"\n\nBurke's peers know she that she understands the gravity of the moment. But they also know she will be laser-focused on the task at hand. \"Her strength is she puts the game first,\" Breen said.\n\n\"It's not lost on her that calling an NBA final in the home of the Celtics is a huge deal,\" O'Brien said. \"It won't be lost on her for one second. But then when that second passes, she's got the ball. She's ready to go.\"\n\nThey know her well.\n\n\"I know I'm going to be nervous as hell,\" Burke said. \"But I'm going to just try to call the game.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com",

But I would be lying if I didn't tell you that I am sort of mindful that there is something meaningful here, right,\" she said. \"And the meaning for me would be if, in some way, this assignment makes life for women in sports easier or somehow aids in their process, then nothing could be more meaningful.\n\n\"Anybody calling their first NBA Finals game would probably be nervous, and I think if I allow my mind to drift too much into that space, it will make that nervousness a little bit worse.\"\n\nAnn Meyers Drysdale, the first woman to work an NBA game for one of the broadcast networks in 1997 for NBC, said Burke has deserved this opportunity.\n\n\"She's worked hard. Somebody has given her an opportunity, she's taken it and been productive,\" Meyers said.\n\nBurke has also acknowledged she feels \"fortunate to be operating at the point in history within which I'm operating.\" Quite simply, she saw the experiences Roberts and Meyers went through breaking barriers while also forging their own path. But Burke is also in a position to mentor analysts and announcers who are coming up.\n\n\"I say it every time I see her and Ann Meyers Drysdale. I wouldn't have the role and the position that I have without them not only having done the job, but doing it with so much competence and diligence,\" said Sarah Kustok, an analyst for Brooklyn Nets games on YES Network. \"How she has thrived in that role has set the table for so many of us.\"\n\nBurke's influence goes beyond basketball. Jessica Mendoza said she pushed management at ESPN to start doing baseball after seeing Burke call a game. Mendoza started doing MLB games in 2015, was part of \"Sunday Night Baseball\" from 2016 to '19, and has done the World Series on ESPN Radio since 2020.\n\n\"When I heard Doris on an NBA game as an analyst, not a reporter, it just completely changed my thoughts about my own position but also women in general that have played the sport,\" Mendoza said. \"She has helped me out with advice and how to approach things like she experienced her first few years. You know, all the questions that I can only ask a handful of women in the world.\"\n\nDuring a conference call this week, Burke did not get emotional discussing her milestone, but in praising her teammates -- announcer Mike Breen and analyst JJ Reddick.\n\nBreen will be calling his 19th finals, but his first since 2006 where Jeff Van Gundy hasn't been an analyst. Van Gundy and Mark Jackson were laid off last July as part of job cuts by the network. Breen, Van Gundy and Jackson called 15 finals together.\n\nLast August, Breen, Burke and Doc Rivers were announced as ESPN's main NBA team. Those plans changed in late January when Rivers left to coach the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\n\"He's never said it's been difficult, but knowing Mike and the position he's been put in, you know, this probably has not been easy, necessarily, throughout the course of the year,\" Burke said. \"There's points at which Mike has navigated us through spaces, and I am incredibly appreciative. JJ has been as good a teammate on the air and off as I could possibly hope for.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doris Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Meyers", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ann Meyers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Kustok", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Kustok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Van_Gundy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Van Gundy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Breen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Breen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Night_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunday Night Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YES_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YES Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6UlmDKKURmGBQxoizcRrsw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/2b8faf342192c134fff9108c33e5c534", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9631140", "eventUri": "eng-9631140", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

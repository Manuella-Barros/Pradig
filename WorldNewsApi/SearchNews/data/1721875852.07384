Trump hit his usual marks, from attacking migrants and border complaints to touting his role in erasing women\u2019s reproductive rights by appointing Supreme Court justices who ended the federal right to abortion access, and some other truly wild stuff in between. The two candidates have taken different approaches in the lead-up to their upcoming debate. Biden has reportedly been at Camp David with his senior campaign aides preparing for the debate. Meanwhile, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee spent Saturday speaking at the conservative Faith & Freedom Coalition\u2019s \u201cRoad to Majority\u201d conference in Washington D.C. and held a rally in the swing state of Pennsylvania at Temple University in Philadelphia. Trump brought up the debate during his Pennsylvania appearance, claiming that Biden will need some medicinal help. \u201cThey want to get him good and strong. So a little before debate time, he gets a shot in the ass \u2014 they want to strengthen him up,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cI\u2019ll say he\u2019ll come out all jacked up, right?\u201d The unfounded accusation prompted some to allege that Trump spoke from his own treatment experiences. Continuing with his fear-mongering regarding the U.S. border and migrants in the country, Trump proposed the dehumanizing idea to have migrants be made to fight against professional UFC fighters during both of his appearances on Saturday. \u201cI said, \u2018Dana, Dana [White, President of Ultimate Fighting Championship], I have an idea for you to make a lot of money. You\u2019re gonna go and start a new migrant fight league. Migrants, only migrants,\u2019\u201d Trump said during his Philadelphia speech, echoing what he proposed during his D.C. speech earlier in the day. \u201cAnd then at the end of the year, the champion migrant is going to fight your champion.\u201d \u201cAnd I hate to tell you, Dana, I think that migrant might win. That\u2019s how tough they are. These are not, this is not a normal situation\u2026 These people are drug dealers, gang members, killers in so many different ways. Now, and we probably have 18 million we\u2019ll have 20 million by the time we get this guy [Joe Biden] out of there,\u201d Trump further claimed. Earlier on Saturday, during his speech for Christian right group, Faith & Freedom Coalition in D.C., he talked about his favoring having the Ten Commandments posted at schools. \u201cHas anybody read \u2018the Thou Shall Not Steal?\u2019,\u201d he said, teeing himself up for one of his favorite subjects: falsely claiming that he lost the 2020 election due to stolen votes \u2014 never mind other commandments, such as Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery. During his D.C. speech, he played martyr as well. \u201cI have the wounds all over my body,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIf I took this shirt off you\u2019d see a beautiful, beautiful person.\u201d He didn\u2019t follow through with removing his clothing, thankfully, but added: \u201cBut you\u2019d see wounds all over. All over me. I\u2019ve taken a lot of wounds, I can tell you. More than I expect any president ever.\u201d It appears he may have forgotten about the assassinations of Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, John F. Kennedy, and also the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan. Trump also took credit for the eradication of Roe v. Wade. \u201cI want to thank the six Supreme Court justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett \u2014 for the wisdom and the courage they showed for the wisdom and courage to end Roe v. Wade,\u201d Trump said during his appearance in D.C. Biden and Trump\u2019s debate on Thursday will be hosted by CNN in Atlanta at 9 p.m. ET, with CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash serving as moderators.", "summary": "The presumptive GOP presidential nominee touted the dehumanizing idea at a Faith &#38; Freedom Coalition event and at a Pennsylvania rally", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/donald-trump-proposes-migrant-fight-league-rally-speech-1235045165/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DonaldTrump-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:33:38", "author": "Althea Legaspi", "authors": ["Althea Legaspi"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.047}

There are several reasons that can happen, including pollen counts being higher in the morning and dust mites that live in and around your bed. Along with buying a humidifier, investing in some anti-allergy pillows or hypoallergenic pillows should be at the top of your to-do list. These Silentnight anti-allergy pillows from Amazon may help reduce or prevent an allergic reaction to dust mites, pet hair and pollen. Approved by the British Allergy Foundation, they are filled with anti-bacterial, anti-allergy fibres that actively protect against spores and dust mites, helping to prevent allergies and keep your pillows feeling fresh and clean. A pair of medium support pillows has been reduced to \u00a316, but you can also choose from firm support and soft support depending on your sleep style. They can be easily washed, dried, and back on your bed in no time, plus users praise them for being 'comfortable' as well as practical.

One very impressed user wrote: \"I have year-round allergies. It never occurred to me that my bedding might be making my symptoms worse. I needed new pillows and a duvet so when I spotted the anti-allergy ones it made sense to give them a go, nothing to lose right? Anyway, after using them for the first time last night, I awoke this morning, for the first time in my life, without, a runny nose, wheezy chest and a blocked nose.\" Another person shared: \"So pleased I bought these as my hay fever and allergies have abated so much. Will make sure I replace them regularly to keep me sneeze-free.\" And a third said: \"It was time to change pillows and these fit the bill exactly; I'd had a dreadful few months of hay fever and these brought comfort to bear. Good price, good job.\" You won't have to switch up your pillows with the change of the season, as the Silentnight anti-allergy pillows will provide comfort all year round, whether you're dealing with hay fever or not. They've been described as 'very soft and plump' while still offering 'support to the head, neck and shoulders'. However, not everyone was pleased with the Silentnight pillows and preferred Dunelm alternatives instead. A disappointed shopper wrote: \"I have had a mixed experience. Out of the two pillows, one has become noticeably slimmer after some use, which is disappointing. The other pillow, however, has maintained its shape and offers good support. Overall, they are decent pillows and might be worth trying, but be aware that the quality may vary between the two.\" These Dunlem Dorma Pack of 2 Full Forever Anti-Allergy Side Sleeper Pillows are \u00a324 with shoppers saying they have 'never had such comfortable pillows to sleep on'. In terms of hay fever help, one review explained: \"I was suffering from a blocked nose and hay-fever-like symptoms before the penny dropped that it could be my pillows that were causing these symptoms. I was right! These are so great - plump, too!\" Marks and Spencer have a two-pack of Anti Allergy Plus Pillows in medium or firm for \u00a325.", "summary": "With the pollen count high in the UK, those who struggle with hay fever are using these allergy-friendly Amazon pillows to reduce symptoms", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/hay-fever-sufferers-find-relief-29420958", "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/article29159337.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_side-sleeper.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:00:00", "author": "Lucy Addicott", "authors": ["Lucy Addicott"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.297}

The much-anticipated annual spectacle, which took place on Saturday to honour King Charles' official birthday, was also a significant occasion for the princess, marking her first public outing since she temporarily stepped away from Royal duties last Christmas due to ongoing health concerns. The special occasion also marked Kate's first Royal duty since the announcement in March that she was receiving chemotherapy treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer. \"It was really nice to see the Princess of Wales, and the children of course. It made the day even more special,\" Garrison Sergeant Major Andrew \"Vern\" Stokes, hailing from Telford, expressed his delight. \"We prepared for the princess, just in case,\" GSM Stokes disclosed their readiness for her potential appearance.

Over 1,000 soldiers from the Army's Household Division participated in the grand ceremony, which also featured a spectacular fly-past by the Red Arrows. The event, complete with hundreds of military working horses, drew thousands of spectators to witness the grandeur of the occasion. \"The atmosphere is incredible,\" GSM Stokes enthused about the vibe on the parade ground. \"When you're on the parade ground, not only does everybody feel really special to be part of the day, but actually back home as well in living rooms, there's about five million people watching on television.\" \"So it's a really special day. Marching back to Buckingham Palace along the Mall, seeing all the union flags in the middle of this wonderful music, and tens of thousands of members of the public all cheering for the King, that is a really special moment,\" he added. Not only was Major Stokes overseeing Trooping the Colour, but on Monday, he also took part in the annual Garter Day procession at Windsor Castle. This historic ceremony saw King Charles, Queen Camilla and Prince William all step out in full ceremonial attire. \"It's full of the public, but it's really intimate as well,\" he shared with BBC Radio Shropshire. \"Everybody gets to see the King and the Queen, and other members of the royal family and the Garter knights really close, so it's a lovely, intimate day.\"", "summary": "The soldier who led King Charles' Trooping the Colour has spoken out about the 'really special' event, which saw the Princess of Wales make her first public appearance in months", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/seeing-kate-middleton-trooping-colour-33051798", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/article33051795.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_trooping-the-colour-2024.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:04:45", "author": "Phoebe Tonks", "authors": ["Phoebe Tonks"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.427}

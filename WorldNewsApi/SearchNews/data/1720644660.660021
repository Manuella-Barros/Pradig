A Special Connection With Bermuda Destra\u2019s connection with Bermuda is not just about the performances but extends to the island\u2019s culture and people. \u201cI love Bermuda,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of my first experiences in Bermuda was experiencing the beautiful beaches and the excitement of the people. [I remember] the crowds that came out, and how they love Soca and the appreciation for my work.\u201d Destra\u2019s performances in Bermuda have left an indelible mark on her, bringing out the best in her on stage. \u201cThe energy ball between the crowd and me is incredible. It\u2019s like throwing energy back and forth until it culminates into a fantastic performance,\u201d she enthuses. Soca In The City: A Carnival of Rhythms This Saturday, Destra will grace the stage at Soca in the City, held at BAA Car Park. The event, boasting a lineup that includes Mical Teja, the 2024 Trinidad Road March winner, as well as notable local acts like Fire Wayne and the Rated E Dancers, promises to be a highlight for soca enthusiasts. Destra\u2019s music, known for its diversity, mirrors her rich cultural background. \u201cI\u2019m part French, Spanish, African. This mix influences everything I do. Whether it\u2019s the Indian-infused or Spanish-infused songs, the common thread is the pulsating Caribbean drums, she explained. The Queen of Bacchanal has collaborated with dozens of renowned artists over the years. Discussing her approach to collaborations and music, she said she values the uniqueness artists she works with bring to the table. She cherishes the new dimensions these collaborations introduce into her music, revealing a preference for uniqueness and diversity, which also resonates deeply with her audiences. Music in the Bloodline: A Family Legacy Outside the studio, Destra is profoundly influenced by the legends of music, including Bob Marley and Whitney Houston, the latter of which she describes as a significant vocal influence. \u201cI\u2019ve never done vocal training, but just trying to sing Whitney\u2019s songs and emulating her in my younger years helped me to train my vocals,\u201d she shares. For Destra, music is deeply familial and intrinsic. \u201cMy grandfather was a saxophonist. He used to play in a jazz band and also tour just like I do now. I grew up in a family of diverse music tastes. So for me, music is very much embedded in my DNA,\u201d she recalls. She sees herself continuing her family\u2019s legacy, contributing to the vibrant culture of soca with every performance. An Unforgettable Night of Soca Regarding her performance in Bermuda at Soca in the City, Destra is as enthusiastic as ever. \u201cI know what the audience expects of me, and I\u2019m ready to deliver. We have a great chemistry,\u201d she notes, promising a night of unforgettable music and passion. Joining her is Mical Teja, who brings a modern twist to traditional sounds. He admits he likes experimenting with traditional music and bringing it into a modern space. This captures the essence of contemporary soca, he added. As the gates open on Saturday at 5pm and the Caribbean beats take over, Destra and Mical Teja are both ready to transform the BAA Car Park into a haven of soca music.

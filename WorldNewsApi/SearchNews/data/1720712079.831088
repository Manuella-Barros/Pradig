{"id": 231942054, "title": "Ticked off! @bad dog owners", "text": "I am more than ticked off to receive dozens of unsolicited political text messages and calls from various political entities asking for donations and support every day. Another example of how politicians provide exemptions from laws that the rest of us must abide by. If I had to pay for these calls or texts I\u2019d be furious. They should be made to live by the laws they make for everyone else. Growing up here, 65 years ago, we looked at clouds. Fluffy, cloudy, dark, scary. Now it is meteorologist welfare. People are not airplanes. People don\u2019t melt. I\u2019m ticked off at the WNBA players behavior towards a particular rookie superstar player. Their lowlife street-style of play is due to their jealousy of the one particular star player. She has singlehandedly put the whole WNBA league on the map now. Players salaries are up and attendance is thru the roof this season. You should be thankful for her saving all of your jobs! I am ticked off by irresponsible dog owners! My neighbors purchased a toy poodle puppy and he keeps getting loose. I am concerned the puppy will get hit by a car or stolen. He is such a sweet and adorable puppy! He gets loose every day, so it is obvious these owners are not even trying to do all they can to keep the little guy safe! It breaks my heart and makes me angry! I\u2019m ticked off at ticked off submissions that blather on, repeating the same arguments over and over. Keep it succinct. Repeating your beef does not strengthen your position. Repeating your beef does not strengthen your position. Repeating your beef does not strengthen your position. The flip side A big thanks to the City of Orlando Sidewalks Department and their staff and contractors for the great job with the new sidewalks and curbs in the Milk District. They look terrific and you have made many lives a lot easier and safer to get around. Those hard workers actually sculptured the curbs around each sidewalk.

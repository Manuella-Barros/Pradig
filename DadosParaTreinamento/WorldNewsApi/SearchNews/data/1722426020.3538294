Biden\u2019s performance was so bad that there are now widespread (and likely unrealistic) calls for him to step down as the nominee. (Though, weirdly, no such calls have been made of his convicted felon opponent who attempted to overthrow the government just four years ago.) You can read more here. Hayes began by noting that Biden has \u201cbeen elected office for 50 years plus\u201d and that, \u201che is quite a capable politician who\u2019s run and won a lot of races in his time, including as a 29 year old young man\u201d who \u201cbeat Trump the first time.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s got a good record,\u201d Hayes said before acknowledging \u201cHis future looks a lot more uncertain.\u201d \u201cThe New York Times editorial board took the unprecedented step of calling for Biden to leave the race today, writing that there \u2018is no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between Mr Trump\u2019s deficiencies and those of Mr. Biden. It\u2019s too big a bet to simply hope Americans will overlook or discount Mr. Biden\u2019s age and infirmity, they see with their own eyes,\u2019\u201d Hayes quoted. Acknowledging that all signs indicate Biden doesn\u2019t plan to step down, Hayes continued that doing so would be complicated and would be \u201ca move that will come with its own risk.\u201d But, he continued, \u201call that being said, I think the quantitative and qualitative data, the polling and the eye test both tell us that this is probably not the strongest possible Democratic candidate to beat a wildly dangerous man who poses an existential threat to democracy.\u201d \u201cUltimately, that\u2019s now for Joe Biden to decide. He won the primary. He got the most delegates. He is a Democratic Party nominee, and he will be the Democratic nominee unless he decides not to be,\u201d Hayes concluded.", "summary": "<p>The MSNBC host worries POTUS is \"probably not the strongest candidate\" to defeat \"Wildly Dangerous\" Trump</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/chris-hayes-joe-biden-debate-calls-to-step-down-msnbc/\">Chris Hayes Notes That Joe Biden &#8216;Will Be the Democratic Nominee, Unless He Decides Not to Be&#8217; | Video</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com\">TheWrap</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/chris-hayes-joe-biden-debate-calls-to-step-down-msnbc/", "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chris-Hayes-Joe-Biden-Trump-Debate-Step-Down-MSNBC.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:22:28", "author": "Ross A.

ally Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war.\n\nHezbollah fighters launched \"an attack with rockets and drones, targeting six barracks and military sites\" while simultaneously

The attacks were carried out in retaliation for an Israeli strike on Tuesday that killed a senior Hezbollah field commander. A security source told Lebanon it was the largest attack waged by Hezbollah since October, when the group started exchanging fire with Israel in parallel with the Gaza war.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement it had fired volleys of Katyusha and Falaq rockets at six Israeli military locations. Its Al-Manar television reported more than 100 rockets fired at once. Hezbollah's statement said it had also launched attack drones at the headquarters of Israel's northern command, an intelligence headquarters and a military barracks.\n\nA security source told Reuters that involved firing at least 30 attack drones at once, making it the group's largest drone attack to date in the eight-month-old war. The Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel have been trading near-daily fire since the eruption of the Gaza war in October, but the last two days have seen a sharp rise following the Israeli strike that killed the Hezbollah commander.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hezbollah said it carried out at least eight attacks that day in retaliation. Air raid sirens sounded across cities in northern Israel on Thursday and Israeli officials said about 40 rockets had been fired from Lebanon in the afternoon.\n\nState broadcaster Kan aired footage of numerous mid-air interceptions of rockets above Israeli towns, including in Safed, some 12 km (7.5 miles) from the border. Two people were wounded by shrapnel, Israel's national ambulance service said.\n\nIsraeli strikes have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon - more than it lost in 2006, when the sides last fought a major war, according to a Reuters tally. The number of civilians killed is around 80, the tally says. Attacks from Lebanon have killed 18 Israeli soldiers and 10 civilians, Israel says. The exchanges of fire have also displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.\n\n\"Diplomatically or militarily, peace will be returned to our north. Israel will defend itself.

Despite the near-daily exchange of fire, the confrontations have largely been limited to the border area.\n\nTens of thousands of people in south Lebanon and northern Israel have fled their homes to escape the violence.\n\nLate last month, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah portrayed the Lebanese front with Israel as historically decisive.\n\n\"This battle concerns Palestine, but also concerns the future of Lebanon and its water and oil resources,\" Nasrallah said. \"This front is a support front that is part of the battle that will determine the fate of Palestine, Lebanon and the region strategically.\"\n\nAided by Iran, the Lebanese organisation has grown in strength in recent years. Hezbollah fought a years-long war against Israel, culminating in the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of south Lebanon they occupied for nearly two decades.\n\nIn 2006, Israel launched a major offensive to disarm Hezbollah after the group carried out a deadly cross-border attack against Israeli forces. The conflict ended without major changes to the status quo. But Hezbollah has grown both its rocket arsenal and regional influence since then.\n\nEarlier this month, Hezbollah deputy chief Sheikh Naim Qassem told Al Jazeera that the group is \"ready\" for war if Israel intensifies its attacks.\n\n\"Any Israeli expansion of the war on Lebanon will be met with devastation, destruction and displacement in Israel,\" he said. \"If Israel wants to fight an all-out war, we are ready for it.\"\n\nIsraeli officials have pledged to push Hezbollah fighters further away from the country's borders, including by force if necessary.\n\n\"Israel will respond with force to all aggressions by Hezbollah,\" Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said on Thursday. \"Whether through diplomatic efforts or otherwise, Israel will restore security on our northern border.\"\n\nA war with Hezbollah, which has demonstrated sophisticated military capabilities, including the use of guided rockets and precision drones, could prove more costly to Israel than the continuing conflict in Gaza.\n\nReporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr said Hezbollah has been stepping up its attacks not only to respond to the killing of its commander but also to strengthen Hamas's negotiating position amid ceasefire talks and warn Israel against launching a major offensive in Lebanon.\n\n\"So this is also about deterrence on the part of Hezbollah,\" Khodr said.\n\n\"No doubt, this is a dangerous escalation of this ongoing conflict,\" referring to the Israeli promise to respond to the latest attacks.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType":

which vows to hit back", "body": "Beirut (AFP) - Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group said it fired waves of rockets and drones at the Israeli army on Thursday, after an Israeli strike killed one of its senior commanders.\n\nIt was Hezbollah's largest simultaneous attack in near-daily cross-border fire between it and the Israeli army since its ally Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war.\n\nHezbollah fighters launched \"an attack with rockets and drones, targeting six barracks and military sites\" while simultaneously flying \"squadrons of explosive-laden drones\" at three other Israeli bases, the group said in a statement.\n\nOne of the targets was an Israeli base that Hezbollah said housed an intelligence headquarters \"responsible for the assassinations\".\n\nHezbollah, which announced more strikes into the evening, said the attacks were \"part of the response to the assassination\" of Hezbollah commander Taleb Abdallah on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli army said about \"40 projectiles were launched toward the Galilee and Golan Heights area\", adding most were intercepted while others ignited fires.\n\nIn one attack near the border village of Manara, \"one IDF (army) soldier was moderately injured and an additional soldier was lightly injured\", the military said.\n\nThe Israeli government vowed to respond strongly to all Hezbollah attacks.\n\n\"Israel will respond with force to all aggressions by Hezbollah,\" government spokesman David Mencer said during a press briefing.\n\n\"Whether through diplomatic efforts or otherwise, Israel will restore security on our northern border,\" he added.\n\nIn recent weeks, cross-border exchanges have escalated, with Hezbollah stepping up its use of drones to attack Israeli military positions and Israel hitting back with targeted strikes against the militants.\n\nOn Wednesday, top Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine vowed the group would \"increase the intensity, strength, quantity and quality of our attacks\", while speaking at Abdallah's funeral.\n\nThe Israeli army confirmed it carried out the strike that \"eliminated\" Abdallah on Tuesday, describing him as \"one of Hezbollah's most senior commanders in southern Lebanon\".\n\nA Lebanese military source said he was the \"most important\" Hezbollah commander to have been killed since the start of the war.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 468 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 89 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 Israeli soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah",

Scores of rockets were fired from Lebanon toward northern Israel on Wednesday morning, hours after Israeli airstrikes killed four officials from the militant Hezbollah group including a senior military commander.\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday pushed back against assertions that Israel isn't fully committed to the cease-fire proposal with Hamas outlined by U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Israel has supplied this proposal. It has been sitting on the table for some time. Israel has not contradicted or walked that back,\" Sullivan said Thursday in Italy, where Biden was set to attend the annual Group of Seven leaders' summit. \"To this day they stand behind the proposal.\"\n\n\"I don't think that there is a contradiction in the Israeli position,\" Sullivan added.\n\nSullivan reiterated that Hamas had responded by offering an amended proposal and he said the goal is \"to figure out how we work to bridge the remaining gaps and get to a deal.\"\n\nHamas requested numerous changes this week to a U.S.-backed proposal, saying its \"amendments\" aim to guarantee a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. The cease-fire proposal announced by Biden includes those provisions, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms.\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.

This week's escalation comes as some Israeli leaders have threatened all-out war to silence Hezbollah's rocket fire, which has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis, and as Iran-backed Hezbollah seeks to exert pressure in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas during back-and-forth negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement it fired rockets at the six Israeli posts Thursday and simultaneously launched explosive drones at three other posts, including a main intelligence division in northern Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military said approximately 45 projectiles, including rockets and drones, were launched toward the Galilee and Golan Heights areas.\n\nIsrael's Magen David Adom rescue service said two people were lightly injured from shrapnel in the Golan Heights.\n\nThe military said many of the projectiles were successfully intercepted by the Aerial Defense Array, without giving an exact breakdown, while others hit and caused brush fires. The military said it identified at least eight aerial targets -- referring to drones -- and six were intercepted.\n\nIsrael said its warplanes bombed infrastructure used by Hezbollah in several locations in southern Lebanon on Thursday.\n\nHezbollah fired more than 200 projectiles into Israel on Wednesday, according to the army, hours after an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of the group's Nasr Unit in charge of parts of south Lebanon close to the Israeli border.\n\nHezbollah says it won't stop the attacks until there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. The Arab world's most powerful paramilitary force has been striking deeper inside Israel in recent weeks, introducing new and more advanced weaponry.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 400 people in the current round of fighting, most of them Hezbollah members, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants, and tens of thousands have been displaced from communities in the south. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed.\n\nIraq's top diplomat says he is concerned Israel might escalate military action in Lebanon\n\nBAGHDAD -- Iraq's top diplomat expressed concerns Thursday that Israel might escalate its military operations in Lebanon with ripple effects that could reach his country.\n\n\"There are dangerous signs that there may be an attack on southern Lebanon and if this attack happens, it will affect the region and not just Lebanon,\" Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said after a meeting with acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani in his first visit to Baghdad since taking the post. The two officials called for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nKani replaced former Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who died in a helicopter crash on May 19 along with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and a delegation of other officials.\n\nIranian-backed militias in Iraq have launched drone attacks on targets in Israel and on bases in Iraq and Syria housing U.S. troops since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, where Israeli forces are fighting against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. However, the most intense fighting outside of Gaza has been on the Lebanon-Israel border, where the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been clashing with Israeli forces almost daily for more than eight months.\n\nIn recent weeks, those clashes have intensified, with fears of a further escalation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that Israel is \"prepared for very intense action\" along its northern border with Lebanon. Should a wider conflict break out in Lebanon, the Iraqi militias are widely expected to join their ally, Hezbollah, in the fight.\n\nUS national security adviser says Israel stands behind cease-fire proposal\n\nFASANO, Italy -- U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday pushed back against assertions that Israel isn't fully committed to the cease-fire proposal with Hamas that President Joe Biden outlined in late May at the White House.\n\n\"Israel has supplied this proposal. It has been sitting on the table for some time. Israel has not contradicted or walked that back,\" Sullivan said Thursday in Italy, where Biden was set to attend the annual Group of Seven leaders' summit. \"To this day they stand behind the proposal.\"\n\n\"I don't think that there is a contradiction in the Israeli position,\" Sullivan added.\n\nSullivan reiterated that Hamas had responded by offering an amended proposal and he said the goal is \"to figure out how we work to bridge the remaining gaps and get to a deal.\"\n\n\"The goal is to try to bring this to a conclusion as rapidly as possible,\" he told reporters.\n\nVoices of displaced Palestinians in Gaza: jaded hopes for a cease-fire despite war's bloody toll\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Weary after eight months of war, frustrated Palestinians displaced from their homes in Gaza said Wednesday they are cautiously hoping for a cease-fire.\n\nSome are more skeptical than others, as previous moments of optimism have been dashed by differences between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"We are psychologically tired,\" said Etaf Abdel Bari, a displaced woman living in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah. \"They negotiated a lot, to no avail? We are not a toy in their hands. Our sons, daughters, and families killed without a reason. For what?\"\n\nMore than 1 million people have fled Israel's invasion of the southern Gaza city Rafah, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\n\"Every day there is a truce, there is no truce. We want a solution. We want to return to our homes,\" said a displaced man, Salama Abu al-Qumbuz. \"We are tired of this life, sleeping in the street, transporting water. Our lives have become very boring.\"\n\nThe United Nations says over one million people in Gaza face desperate hunger and don't have enough clean drinking water.\n\nOther residents of Deir al-Balah took a more cynical view of the back-and-forth truce talks.\n\n\"I expect the war to continue. There are no negotiations,\" said Abu Jamil al-Maqadma. \"The negotiations are false.\"\n\nBlinken says some of Hamas' proposed changes to a cease-fire plan in Gaza are workable and some not\n\nDOHA, Qatar -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that mediators would keep trying to close an elusive cease-fire deal after Hamas proposed numerous changes to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were \"workable\" and some not.\n\nThe back-and-forth laid bare frustration over the difficulty of reaching an accord that can bring an end to eight months of war that has decimated Gaza, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left scores of Israeli hostages still languishing in militant captivity. Previous moments of optimism have been repeatedly dashed by the differences between the two sides.\n\nThe cease-fire proposal has global support but has not been fully embraced by Israel or Hamas. Blinken did not spell out what changes Hamas was seeking but he said the mediators -- Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. -- will keep trying to \"close this deal.\" He put the onus on Hamas, accusing it of changing its demands.\n\n\"Hamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table. ... Some of the changes are workable. Some are not,\" Blinken told reporters in Qatar. \"I believe that they (the differences) are bridgeable, but that doesn't mean they will be bridged because ultimately Hamas has to decide.\"\n\nThe Palestinian militant group says the \"amendments\" aim to guarantee a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nThose provisions are included in the proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms. And although the U.S. says Israel has accepted the proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given conflicting statements, saying Israel is still intent on its goal of destroying Hamas.\n\nThe proposal's three-phase plan would begin with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes. Aid distribution would also increase.\n\nAt the same time, negotiations would start over the second phase, which is to bring \"a permanent end to hostilities\" and \"full withdrawal\" of Israeli troops from Gaza in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages.\n\nA major hitch for both sides appears to be the negotiations for the second phase. Phase three would see the launch of a reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of remains of deceased hostages.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

group said it fired waves of rockets and drones at the Israeli army on Thursday, after an Israeli strike killed one of its senior commanders.\n\nIt was Hezbollah's largest simultaneous attack in near-daily cross-border fire between it and the Israeli army since its ally Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war.\n\nHezbollah fighters launched \"an attack with rockets and drones, targeting six barracks and military sites\" while simultaneously flying \"squadrons of explosive-laden drones\" at three other Israeli bases, the group said in a statement.\n\nOne of the targets was an Israeli base that Hezbollah said housed an intelligence headquarters \"responsible for the assassinations\".\n\nHezbollah, which announced more strikes into the evening, said the attacks were \"part of the response to the assassination\" of Hezbollah commander Taleb Abdallah on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli army said about \"40 projectiles were launched toward the Galilee and Golan Heights area\", adding most were intercepted while others ignited fires.\n\nIn one attack near the border village of Manara, \"one IDF (army) soldier was moderately injured and an additional soldier was lightly injured\", the military said.\n\nThe Israeli government vowed to respond strongly to all Hezbollah attacks.\n\n\"Israel will respond with force to all aggressions by Hezbollah,\" government spokesman David Mencer said during a press briefing.\n\n\"Whether through diplomatic efforts or otherwise, Israel will restore security on our northern border,\" he added.\n\nIn recent weeks, cross-border exchanges have escalated, with Hezbollah stepping up its use of drones to attack Israeli military positions and Israel hitting back with targeted strikes against the militants.\n\nOn Wednesday, top Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine vowed the group would \"increase the intensity, strength, quantity and quality of our attacks\", while speaking at Abdallah's funeral.\n\nThe Israeli army confirmed it carried out the strike that \"eliminated\" Abdallah on Tuesday, describing him as \"one of Hezbollah's most senior commanders in southern Lebanon\".\n\nA Lebanese military source said he was the \"most important\" Hezbollah commander to have been killed since the start of the war.\n\nThe cross-border violence has killed at least 468 people in Lebanon, most of them fighters but also including 89 civilians, according to an AFP tally.\n\nIsraeli authorities say at least 15 Israeli soldiers and 11 civilians have been killed.\n\nburs-aya-lar/ami/srm",

Hezbollah's immediate response included a barrage of almost 200 rockets into northern Israel on Wednesday, during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. On Thursday, incessant rocket fire into Israel continued. It was yet another round of continuous violence between the sides that has been going on for eight months, since Hezbollah joined Hamas' war against Israel, challenging it on its northern border.\n\nA day after the war in Gaza began on October 7, Hezbollah started launching rockets, mortars, and offensive drones into northern Israel. This ongoing offensive by Hezbollah has been met with retaliatory airstrikes and artillery fire from the Israeli military. The sides operate within unspoken rules of engagement, each careful to not cause civilian casualties and not push the geographical limits of the conflict, currently contained to northern Israel and southern Lebanon. Hezbollah has acknowledged the death of at least 300 of its operatives. On the Israeli side, 29 people have been killed in a variety of incidents. In recent weeks, as the hot summer weather reaches its peak, Hezbollah rockets have also caused major fires in northern Israel, destroying thousands of dunams of forest land.\n\nNobody goes down the ladder, it only goes up\n\n\"What we have seen in the past eight months is a very slow-motion escalation, akin to a ladder that each side thinks very carefully about before taking another step up,\" said Heiko Wimmen, project director of Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon at the International Crisis Group. \"Nobody goes down the ladder, it only goes up.\"\n\nSince the beginning of the war, over 60,000 residents of the area have been evacuated by the Israeli government. Others, from areas within Hezbollah's immediate range, have evacuated without a government order. Hopes for re-opening the school year on September 1 in the abandoned territory dwindle as Israel and Hezbollah seem far from resolving the situation.\n\n\"Now there is a danger that this ladder will turn into a spiral, as the leaders on both sides may feel they have to skip some steps on the ladder as they climb up,\" Wimmen added. \"Tactical or technical errors that lead to many civilian casualties despite both sides making serious efforts to avoid this, could create such pressure.\"\n\nIsrael has chosen to contain the conflict, despite calls from ultra-nationalist ministers and part of the public to initiate an all-out war on Hezbollah and Lebanon. The Israeli military has carried out targeted strikes against senior commanders and Hezbollah military outposts.\n\nWhat we are seeing is a war of trading blows that will end in no result other than delaying an all-out war. The question is, what will trigger it?\n\n\"Israel is deterred by Hezbollah,\" said Dr. Eyal Pinko, a professor at Bar-Ilan University's Political Studies Department and an expert on military strategy and intelligence. \"Hezbollah has taken into consideration that its senior officials will be targeted, and this is a minor disturbance to the organization. What we are seeing is a war of trading blows that will end in no result other than delaying an all-out war. The question is, what will trigger it?\"\n\nOn Thursday, as Hezbollah continued to pound Israel with the most rockets fired at its territory since October 7, its patience was being tasted.\n\nHezbollah is taking advantage of Israeli difficulties, and it is currently fruitful for them\n\n\"Israel has eroded some of Hezbollah's abilities but is in a holding mode - not wanting to fight on two fronts simultaneously,\" said Dr. Dan Schueftan, head of the International Graduate Program in National Security Studies at the University of Haifa. \"Hezbollah is taking advantage of Israeli difficulties, and it is currently fruitful for them.\"\n\nIsrael would like to see Hezbollah forces distanced from the border. The last time Hezbollah and Israel went to war was in 2006. The war ended with United Nations Resolution 1701, which brought about a cease-fire and called for Hezbollah forces to be distanced from the border with Israel. This resolution has never been implemented.\n\nResidents in northern Israel have reported an increased visible presence of Hezbollah outposts on the border in recent years, as the deterrent effect of Israel's massive offensive in Lebanon wore off. In late 2018, the Israeli military uncovered what it said were four cross-border tunnels dug by Hezbollah to be used for a raid on border communities. Residents had reported drilling noises throughout the years before the tunnels were revealed. Hamas' tunnel network in Gaza is said to have also been inspired by Hezbollah and was used to open the surprise attack on Israel. Those images were the realization of northern residents' worst nightmare.\n\nIn 2018, the Israeli army completed the construction of a barrier along the border with Lebanon that includes sophisticated surveillance systems.\n\nHowever, residents of Israel's north do not find comfort in the presence of the barrier. The October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel was an exact playout of their own fears. Israel invested billions of dollars in a highly fortified, highly sophisticated border with Gaza which was only to be stormed easily by terrorists on motorcycles, tractors, and parachutes.\n\nFor years, the Israeli military has said it was preparing for a multifront war. It has also conducted numerous large-scale exercises to that effect. But now, as Israel is fighting a war in Gaza, it appears to be avoiding opening a full-on front in Lebanon. While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, together with senior military officers, keep threatening Hezbollah that its time is coming up, so far there has been no change in policy.\n\n\"The army is afraid of entering such a war which will mean thousands of rockets fired daily into central Israel, with a sizeable number of casualties,\" Pinko told The Media Line. \"The army is also not prepared logistically, with not enough forces to execute a military maneuver.\"\n\nIn addition, several reports by the state comptroller have alerted that the home front in Israel is not prepared for such an event, with lacking infrastructure and not enough bomb shelters for the public.\n\n\"Israel is now making adaptations, first of all in understanding that there are deep cultural differences between it and its enemies, who have little regard for civilian life. But also, in the belief that it can do with a small, highly technological army,\" Schueftan told The Media Line. \"This is only true in a battle against a regular army, not terrorist organizations like Hezbollah or Hamas, who fight outside of the battlefield.\"\n\nFor now, Israel and Hezbollah have been very careful in keeping civilians out of the conflict.\n\nIsrael considers the organization its most dangerous enemy, estimating Hezbollah has accumulated over 150,000 unguided rockets and thousands of precision-guided rockets, with the help of the Iranian regime. In addition, it possesses offensive drones that have already been put to use in the current round of violence.\n\nThe multilayered Israeli air defense system, as highly sophisticated as it is, will likely have difficulty fending off barrages of thousands of rockets every day in the event of a war with Hezbollah. Hezbollah's drones have proven to be a major challenge to Israel's defense systems.\n\n\"One of Hezbollah's tactics is to make a lot of noise, forcing Israel to use very expensive systems to intercept the very cheap rockets it is firing and has an endless supply of,\" Wimmen told The Media Line. \"Another tactic is delivering precise blows at military infrastructure to demonstrate that the group is well prepared for a larger confrontation and won't stand down if Israel were to escalate further.\"\n\nAccording to Wimmen, both sides are using the current round of violence to carefully study each other, testing abilities and responses. The scorched earth of northern Israel and southern Lebanon has become a learning ground for modern warfare.\n\nIn recent years, Israel's air force is believed to be behind hundreds of strikes that have targeted this project. Yet the success appears to be limited, as a huge arsenal of rockets is also widely believed to be intact.\n\nNow, Israel is after eight months of war in Gaza. Its forces, including reserve soldiers, are being stretched to the limit. Also, the possibility of a cease-fire with Hamas in Gaza, as vague as it is, has Israel on hold. Many in the defense establishment believe that a settlement with Hamas will inevitably lead to a halt in the fire between Israel and Hezbollah. This is perhaps what Israel is waiting for, as it acknowledges its own limitations.\n\n\"The problem will be that in the end, Israel will not be able to defend the communities on the border,\" said Pinko. \"The 7 of October showed that that ability is close to zero and the only solution is to create a buffer zone within Lebanon which is an unlikely scenario.\"\n\nUS mediator Amos Hochstein has been trying to negotiate a settlement that would satisfy both Israel and Hezbollah and restore calm on the border. The US has put substantial pressure on Israel to contain the conflict as much as possible. In Israel, there are increased calls for a widespread military operation in Lebanon.\n\n\"What is needed now is more force,\" said Schueftan, who believes Israel has succumbed to US pressure for too long. \"Israel shouldn't initiate a war, but it should take steps that risk a war, knowing it could be dangerous. In the Middle East, if someone is not scared of you, you need to be scared of them.\"\n\nDespite the massive rocket barrages in recent days, the Israeli war cabinet is scheduled to convene on Sunday evening, signaling there is no immediate intention to escalate the situation, for now.", "source": {"uri": "themedialine.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Media Line"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(Reuters)\n\nLebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group said it fired a new wave of rockets and drones at the Israeli army on Thursday, after an Israeli strike killed one of its senior commanders, AFP reported.\n\nIt was Hezbollah's largest simultaneous attack in near-daily cross-border fire between it and the Israeli army since its ally Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war.\n\nHezbollah fighters launched \"an attack with rockets and drones, targeting six barracks and military sites\" while simultaneously flying \"squadrons of explosive-laden drones\" at three other Israeli bases, the group said in a statement.\n\nOne of the targets included an Israeli base that Hezbollah said housed an intelligence headquarters \"responsible for the assassinations.\"\n\nHezbollah said the attacks were \"part of the response to the assassination\" of Hezbollah commander Taleb Abdallah on Tuesday.\n\nThe Israeli army said about \"40 projectiles were launched toward the Galilee and Golan Heights area,\" adding most were intercepted while others ignited fires.\n\nThe Israeli government vowed to respond strongly to all Hezbollah attacks.\n\n\"Israel will respond with force to all aggressions by Hezbollah,\" government spokesman David Mencer said during a press briefing.\n\n\"Whether through diplomatic efforts or otherwise,

Shrapnel from Thursday's attack left at least two people wounded in Israel.\n\nThe escalation has tested unwritten rules that have largely confined the conflict to areas at the border or near it since October, keeping Lebanese and Israeli cities out of the firing line.\n\nIsrael said on Thursday that it holds Hezbollah and its Iranian sponsors to blame for the increase in violence and repeated vows to restore security to the border. The Israel Defence Forces did not immediately reply to a request for comment on new Hezbollah capabilities such as the claim to have targeted a warplane.\n\nThe source familiar with Hezbollah's arsenal said it is still calibrating its actions with the intention of avoiding all-out war even as it has stepped up its attacks - the approach it has adopted since the conflict started.\n\nThe source said Hezbollah had begun escalating with the aim of increasing pressure on Israel as it launched an offensive in Rafah in the Gaza Strip in early May, and also with the intention of gradually unveiling more of its capabilities.\n\nThis included the anti-aircraft weapons Hezbollah fired at an Israeli warplane for the first time on June 6, an effort to challenge the air supremacy Israel has long enjoyed, the source said, declining to identify the type of weapon used.\n\nHezbollah has announced four attacks targeting Israeli warplanes in the last week, saying it had forced them to leave Lebanese air space.\n\n\"Hezbollah is showing the kinds of capabilities they have\" in an effort to \"strengthen deterrence for a conventional war,\" said Seth G. Jones, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\"The question is what kind of air defence does Hezbollah have and what more could it get from the Iranians and the Syrians. I suspect that any serious indication of serious capabilities would lead the Israelis to hit hard,\" he said.\n\nHezbollah began trading fire with Israel on Oct. 8, a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked southern Israel, sparking the Gaza war. Hezbollah says it will cease fire only when the Gaza war stops.\n\nTens of thousands of people have fled both sides of the border. Israeli strikes have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters and around 80 civilians in Lebanon, according to Reuters tallies. Attacks from Lebanon have killed 18 Israeli soldiers and 10 civilians.\n\nIsrael has pounded areas where Hezbollah operates in south Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. In Israel, the displacement of so many people has become a big political issue, piling pressure on the government to act.\n\nPrior to this conflict, Israel and Hezbollah had avoided a major clash since a month-long war in 2006, deterred since then by mutual threats of catastrophic destruction.\n\nHezbollah has downed five Israeli drones, flown drones at Israeli targets, and used sophisticated guided rockets that capture footage as they approach their targets, images later broadcast on the group's al-Manar TV.\n\nHezbollah fired Iranian-made Falaq 2 artillery rockets for the first time on June 8, able to carry a bigger warhead than the Falaq 1 it has fired in the past.\n\nIts rockets have also set off wildfires in northern Israel.\n\nHezbollah deputy head Naim Qassem said on June 4 the group did not seek war, but was ready to fight if one was imposed on it. He has also hinted at the weaponry the group has in reserve.\n\n\"What the party has used so far in the battle to support Gaza and proactively defend Lebanon is a small part of what it has, and there are matters whose surprises may be greater,\" he said on June 10.\n\nThe United States, which deems Hezbollah a terrorist group, has led diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict. A U.S. official said on Thursday Washington was very concerned about potential escalation.\n\nHezbollah has indicated its openness to diplomatic arrangements if Lebanon is to benefit, but says this can't be discussed until Israel halts the Gaza offensive. Israel has also indicated openness to a diplomatic settlement that would restore security in the north, whilst preparing for an offensive.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel has been using its air power to strike Lebanon on a near daily basis, targeting Hezbollah fighters in the south, the Bekaa Valley, and even striking Beirut on one occasion to kill a senior Hamas leader. Hezbollah wants to reestablish the deterrence that would make Israel think twice.\n\n\"They had to escalate because they lost deterrence, they need to reestablish deterrence,\" said Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy director for research at the Carnegie Middle East Center.\n\n\"But also when it comes to Israel's Rafah operation, they needed to act. They justified their participation in the war to support and show solidarity to Gaza, so they had to act.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Tom Perry in Beirut and James Mackenzie in Jerusalem; Writing by

Shrapnel from Thursday's attack left at least two people wounded in Israel.\n\nThe escalation has tested unwritten rules that have largely confined the conflict to areas at the border or near it since October, keeping Lebanese and Israeli cities out of the firing line.\n\nIsrael said on Thursday that it holds Hezbollah and its Iranian sponsors to blame for the increase in violence and repeated vows to restore security to the border. The Israel Defence Forces did not immediately reply to a request for comment on new Hezbollah capabilities such as the claim to have targeted a warplane.\n\nThe source familiar with Hezbollah's arsenal said it is still calibrating its actions with the intention of avoiding all-out war even as it has stepped up its attacks - the approach it has adopted since the conflict started.\n\nThe source said Hezbollah had begun escalating with the aim of increasing pressure on Israel as it launched an offensive in Rafah in the Gaza Strip in early May, and also with the intention of gradually unveiling more of its capabilities.\n\nThis included the anti-aircraft weapons Hezbollah fired at an Israeli warplane for the first time on June 6, an effort to challenge the air supremacy Israel has long enjoyed, the source said, declining to identify the type of weapon used.\n\nHezbollah has announced four attacks targeting Israeli warplanes in the last week, saying it had forced them to leave Lebanese air space.\n\n\"Hezbollah is showing the kinds of capabilities they have\" in an effort to \"strengthen deterrence for a conventional war,\" said Seth G. Jones, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\"The question is what kind of air defence does Hezbollah have and what more could it get from the Iranians and the Syrians. I suspect that any serious indication of serious capabilities would lead the Israelis to hit hard,\" he said.\n\nMORE 'SURPRISES'\n\nHezbollah began trading fire with Israel on Oct. 8, a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked southern Israel, sparking the Gaza war. Hezbollah says it will cease fire only when the Gaza war stops.\n\nTens of thousands of people have fled both sides of the border. Israeli strikes have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters and around 80 civilians in Lebanon, according to Reuters tallies. Attacks from Lebanon have killed 18 Israeli soldiers and 10 civilians.\n\nIsrael has pounded areas where Hezbollah operates in south Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. In Israel, the displacement of so many people has become a big political issue, piling pressure on the government to act.\n\nPrior to this conflict, Israel and Hezbollah had avoided a major clash since a month-long war in 2006, deterred since then by mutual threats of catastrophic destruction.\n\nHezbollah's arsenal has grown enormously since 2006.\n\nHezbollah has downed five Israeli drones, flown drones at Israeli targets, and used sophisticated guided rockets that capture footage as they approach their targets, images later broadcast on the group's al-Manar TV.\n\nHezbollah fired Iranian-made Falaq 2 artillery rockets for the first time on June 8, able to carry a bigger warhead than the Falaq 1 it has fired in the past.\n\nIts rockets have also set off wildfires in northern Israel.\n\nHezbollah deputy head Naim Qassem said on June 4 the group did not seek war, but was ready to fight if one was imposed on it. He has also hinted at the weaponry the group has in reserve.\n\n\"What the party has used so far in the battle to support Gaza and proactively defend Lebanon is a small part of what it has, and there are matters whose surprises may be greater,\" he said on June 10.\n\nRESTORING LOST DETERRENCE\n\nThe United States, which deems Hezbollah a terrorist group, has led diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict. A U.S. official said on Thursday Washington was very concerned about potential escalation.\n\nHezbollah has indicated its openness to diplomatic arrangements if Lebanon is to benefit, but says this can't be discussed until Israel halts the Gaza offensive. Israel has also indicated openness to a diplomatic settlement that would restore security in the north, whilst preparing for an offensive.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel has been using its air power to strike Lebanon on a near daily basis, targeting Hezbollah fighters in the south, the Bekaa Valley, and even striking Beirut on one occasion to kill a senior Hamas leader. Hezbollah wants to reestablish the deterrence that would make Israel think twice.\n\n\"They had to escalate because they lost deterrence, they need to reestablish deterrence,\" said Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy director for research at the Carnegie Middle East Center.\n\n\"But also when it comes to Israel's Rafah operation, they needed to act. They justified their participation in the war to support and show solidarity to Gaza, so they had to act.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Tom Perry in Beirut and James Mackenzie in Jerusalem; Writing by

Shrapnel from Thursday's attack left at least two people wounded in Israel.\n\nThe escalation has tested unwritten rules that have largely confined the conflict to areas at the border or near it since October, keeping Lebanese and Israeli cities out of the firing line.\n\nIsrael said on Thursday that it holds Hezbollah and its Iranian sponsors to blame for the increase in violence and repeated vows to restore security to the border. The Israel Defence Forces did not immediately reply to a request for comment on new Hezbollah capabilities such as the claim to have targeted a warplane.\n\nThe source familiar with Hezbollah's arsenal said it is still calibrating its actions with the intention of avoiding all-out war even as it has stepped up its attacks - the approach it has adopted since the conflict started.\n\nThe source said Hezbollah had begun escalating with the aim of increasing pressure on Israel as it launched an offensive in Rafah in the Gaza Strip in early May, and also with the intention of gradually unveiling more of its capabilities.\n\nThis included the anti-aircraft weapons Hezbollah fired at an Israeli warplane for the first time on June 6, an effort to challenge the air supremacy Israel has long enjoyed, the source said, declining to identify the type of weapon used.\n\nHezbollah has announced four attacks targeting Israeli warplanes in the last week, saying it had forced them to leave Lebanese air space.\n\n\"Hezbollah is showing the kinds of capabilities they have\" in an effort to \"strengthen deterrence for a conventional war,\" said Seth G. Jones, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\"The question is what kind of air defence does Hezbollah have and what more could it get from the Iranians and the Syrians. I suspect that any serious indication of serious capabilities would lead the Israelis to hit hard,\" he said.\n\nMORE 'SURPRISES'\n\nHezbollah began trading fire with Israel on Oct. 8, a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked southern Israel, sparking the Gaza war. Hezbollah says it will cease fire only when the Gaza war stops.\n\nTens of thousands of people have fled both sides of the border. Israeli strikes have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters and around 80 civilians in Lebanon, according to Reuters tallies. Attacks from Lebanon have killed 18 Israeli soldiers and 10 civilians.\n\nIsrael has pounded areas where Hezbollah operates in south Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. In Israel, the displacement of so many people has become a big political issue, piling pressure on the government to act.\n\nPrior to this conflict, Israel and Hezbollah had avoided a major clash since a month-long war in 2006, deterred since then by mutual threats of catastrophic destruction.\n\nHezbollah's arsenal has grown enormously since 2006.\n\nHezbollah has downed five Israeli drones, flown drones at Israeli targets, and used sophisticated guided rockets that capture footage as they approach their targets, images later broadcast on the group's al-Manar TV.\n\nHezbollah fired Iranian-made Falaq 2 artillery rockets for the first time on June 8, able to carry a bigger warhead than the Falaq 1 it has fired in the past.\n\nIts rockets have also set off wildfires in northern Israel.\n\nHezbollah deputy head Naim Qassem said on June 4 the group did not seek war, but was ready to fight if one was imposed on it. He has also hinted at the weaponry the group has in reserve.\n\n\"What the party has used so far in the battle to support Gaza and proactively defend Lebanon is a small part of what it has, and there are matters whose surprises may be greater,\" he said on June 10.\n\nRESTORING LOST DETERRENCE\n\nThe United States, which deems Hezbollah a terrorist group, has led diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict. A U.S. official said on Thursday Washington was very concerned about potential escalation.\n\nHezbollah has indicated its openness to diplomatic arrangements if Lebanon is to benefit, but says this can't be discussed until Israel halts the Gaza offensive. Israel has also indicated openness to a diplomatic settlement that would restore security in the north, whilst preparing for an offensive.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel has been using its air power to strike Lebanon on a near daily basis, targeting Hezbollah fighters in the south, the Bekaa Valley, and even striking Beirut on one occasion to kill a senior Hamas leader. Hezbollah wants to reestablish the deterrence that would make Israel think twice.\n\n\"They had to escalate because they lost deterrence, they need to reestablish deterrence,\" said Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy director for research at the Carnegie Middle East Center.\n\n\"But also when it comes to Israel's Rafah operation, they needed to act. They justified their participation in the war to support and show solidarity to Gaza, so they had to act.\" (Additional reporting by Tom Perry in Beirut and James Mackenzie in Jerusalem; Writing by

Attacks from Lebanon have killed 18 Israeli soldiers and ten civilians, Israel says.\n\nThe killing of Hezbollah officers has also raised questions about the extent of Israel's intelligence gathering network in southern Lebanon and degree of infiltration of the militant party's military organisation.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has killed at least 320 Hezbollah members, including about a hundred targeted after field operatives gathered \"precise high-quality intelligence\" on them.", "source": {"uri": "thearabweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AW"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_Resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axis of Resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Well-Being_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Well-Being and Safety", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Fitness", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image_800x450_/public/2024-06/2024-06-13_08-02-30_890675.jpg?itok=TQTdYTaY", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9645854", "eventUri": "eng-9645854", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 115, "textEnd": 122}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The army also claimed to have intercepted three suspicious aerial targets in the Syrian occupied Golan Heights without causing damage or injuries.\n\nFollowing the assassination of Abu Taleb, Hezbollah launched 215 rockets and drones towards northern Israel on Wednesday, marking the largest single-day barrage since the hostilities began on Oct. 8, 2023.\n\nThese attacks caused numerous fires in northern Israel, with some posing threats to strategic facilities, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.\n\nTensions have risen along Lebanon's border with Israel amid cross-border attacks between Hezbollah and Israeli forces as Tel Aviv presses ahead with its deadly offensive on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 37,200 people since last October following a Hamas

The cease-fire proposal announced by Biden includes those provisions, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms.\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger because the war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies. U.N. agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- What are the main sticking points in the cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas?\n\n-- Report by UN-backed experts cites crimes by Israeli forces and Palestinian militants starting 0ct. 7.\n\n-- Hezbollah vows to intensify attacks against Israel after an airstrike kills a senior commander.\n\n-- Blinken says some of Hamas' proposed changes to a cease-fire plan in Gaza are workable and some are not.\n\n-- Yemen's Houthi rebels launch boat-borne bomb attack against Greek-owned ship in Red Sea.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHezbollah attacks Israeli bases with rockets and drones in second day of retaliation for killing militant commander\n\nBEIRUT -- The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said Thursday it attacked six Israeli military posts and bases with rockets and explosive drones, in a second day of attacks on northern Israel in retaliation for killing one of the group's top commanders.\n\nCross-border attacks by Israel and Hezbollah have been taking place almost daily since the war in Gaza began in October. This week's escalation comes as some Israeli leaders have threatened all-out war to silence Hezbollah's rocket fire, which has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis, and as Iran-backed Hezbollah seeks to exert pressure in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas during back-and-forth negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement it fired rockets at the six Israeli posts Thursday and simultaneously launched explosive drones at three other posts, including a main intelligence division in northern Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military said approximately 45 projectiles, including rockets and drones, were launched toward the Galilee and Golan Heights areas.\n\nIsrael's Magen David Adom rescue service said two people were lightly injured from shrapnel in the Golan Heights.\n\nThe military said many of the projectiles were successfully intercepted by the Aerial Defense Array, without giving an exact breakdown, while others hit and caused brush fires. The military said it identified at least eight aerial targets -- referring to drones -- and six were intercepted.\n\nIsrael said its warplanes bombed infrastructure used by Hezbollah in several locations in southern Lebanon on Thursday.\n\nHezbollah fired more than 200 projectiles into Israel on Wednesday, according to the army, hours after an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of the group's Nasr Unit in charge of parts of south Lebanon close to the Israeli border.\n\nHezbollah says it won't stop the attacks until there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. The Arab world's most powerful paramilitary force has been striking deeper inside Israel in recent weeks, introducing new and more advanced weaponry.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 400 people in the current round of fighting, most of them Hezbollah members, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants, and tens of thousands have been displaced from communities in the south. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed.\n\nIraq's top diplomat says he is concerned Israel might escalate military action in Lebanon\n\nBAGHDAD -- Iraq's top diplomat expressed concerns Thursday that Israel might escalate its military operations in Lebanon with ripple effects that could reach his country.\n\n\"There are dangerous signs that there may be an attack on southern Lebanon and if this attack happens, it will affect the region and not just Lebanon,\" Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said after a meeting with acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani in his first visit to Baghdad since taking the post. The two officials called for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nKani replaced former Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who died in a helicopter crash on May 19 along with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and a delegation of other officials.\n\nIranian-backed militias in Iraq have launched drone attacks on targets in Israel and on bases in Iraq and Syria housing U.S. troops since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, where Israeli forces are fighting against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. However, the most intense fighting outside of Gaza has been on the Lebanon-Israel border, where the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been clashing with Israeli forces almost daily for more than eight months.\n\nIn recent weeks, those clashes have intensified, with fears of a further escalation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that Israel is \"prepared for very intense action\" along its northern border with Lebanon. Should a wider conflict break out in Lebanon, the Iraqi militias are widely expected to join their ally, Hezbollah, in the fight.\n\nUS national security adviser says Israel stands behind cease-fire proposal\n\nFASANO, Italy -- U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday pushed back against assertions that Israel isn't fully committed to the cease-fire proposal with Hamas that President Joe Biden outlined in late May at the White House.\n\n\"Israel has supplied this proposal. It has been sitting on the table for some time. Israel has not contradicted or walked that back,\" Sullivan said Thursday in Italy, where Biden was set to attend the annual Group of Seven leaders' summit. \"To this day they stand behind the proposal.\"\n\n\"I don't think that there is a contradiction in the Israeli position,\" Sullivan added.\n\nSullivan reiterated that Hamas had responded by offering an amended proposal and he said the goal is \"to figure out how we work to bridge the remaining gaps and get to a deal.\"\n\n\"The goal is to try to bring this to a conclusion as rapidly as possible,\" he told reporters.\n\nVoices of displaced Palestinians in Gaza: jaded hopes for a cease-fire despite war's bloody toll\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Weary after eight months of war, frustrated Palestinians displaced from their homes in Gaza said Wednesday they are cautiously hoping for a cease-fire.\n\nSome are more skeptical than others, as previous moments of optimism have been dashed by differences between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"We are psychologically tired,\" said Etaf Abdel Bari, a displaced woman living in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah. \"They negotiated a lot, to no avail? We are not a toy in their hands. Our sons, daughters, and families killed without a reason. For what?\"\n\nMore than 1 million people have fled Israel's invasion of the southern Gaza city Rafah, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\n\"Every day there is a truce, there is no truce. We want a solution. We want to return to our homes,\" said a displaced man, Salama Abu al-Qumbuz. \"We are tired of this life, sleeping in the street, transporting water. Our lives have become very boring.\"\n\nThe United Nations says over one million people in Gaza face desperate hunger and don't have enough clean drinking water.\n\nOther residents of Deir al-Balah took a more cynical view of the back-and-forth truce talks.\n\n\"I expect the war to continue. There are no negotiations,\" said Abu Jamil al-Maqadma. \"The negotiations are false.\"\n\nBlinken says some of Hamas' proposed changes to a cease-fire plan in Gaza are workable and some not\n\nDOHA, Qatar -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that mediators would keep trying to close an elusive cease-fire deal after Hamas proposed numerous changes to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were \"workable\" and some not.\n\nThe back-and-forth laid bare frustration over the difficulty of reaching an accord that can bring an end to eight months of war that has decimated Gaza, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left scores of Israeli hostages still languishing in militant captivity. Previous moments of optimism have been repeatedly dashed by the differences between the two sides.\n\nThe cease-fire proposal has global support but has not been fully embraced by Israel or Hamas. Blinken did not spell out what changes Hamas was seeking but he said the mediators -- Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. -- will keep trying to \"close this deal.\" He put the onus on Hamas, accusing it of changing its demands.\n\n\"Hamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table. ... Some of the changes are workable. Some are not,\" Blinken told reporters in Qatar. \"I believe that they (the differences) are bridgeable, but that doesn't mean they will be bridged because ultimately Hamas has to decide.\"\n\nThe Palestinian militant group says the \"amendments\" aim to guarantee a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nThose provisions are included in the proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms. And although the U.S. says Israel has accepted the proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given conflicting statements, saying Israel is still intent on its goal of destroying Hamas.\n\nThe proposal's three-phase plan would begin with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes. Aid distribution would also increase.\n\nAt the same time, negotiations would start over the second phase, which is to bring \"a permanent end to hostilities\" and \"full withdrawal\" of Israeli troops from Gaza in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages.\n\nA major hitch for both sides appears to be the negotiations for the second phase. Phase three would see the launch of a reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of remains of deceased hostages.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Earlier, the Israeli military said Hezbollah launched 40 projectiles toward northern Israel. Some were intercepted, but others landed and caused fires, the military said in statements.\n\nHezbollah said it targeted six Israeli military sites with missiles and three other bases with explosive-laden drones. The strikes, which Hezbollah said hit their targets, were in \"response to the assassination\" carried out on Tuesday, the group's Al-Manar news outlet reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, an Israeli strike killed Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, the highest-ranking official killed since the start of the hostilities on Oct. 7. The attack prompted Hezbollah to fire more than 215 rockets toward Israel on Wednesday.\n\nLebanon's official National News Agency reported that Israeli airstrikes targeted Deir Seryan as well as Qotrani further north, causing a fire in the latter. The agency additionally reported Israeli shelling outside of Chebaa, close to the Israeli border.\n\nIn a widely shared video on social media, Israeli forces were seen using a catapult to launch fireballs into Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli media reported that two people were injured in the rocket fire on Thursday.\n\nWhy it matters: Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in nearly nonstop cross-border exchanges since the Gaza war began last October, but the situation has escalated in recent weeks, leading to increased US concerns about an all-out war between the two. The Biden administration has been engaged in backchannel diplomacy as it seeks to avert a full-blown war between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nThe Iran-backed group has stepped up its use of drones in the past weeks, and Agence France-Presse called Thursday's strikes Hezbollah's \"largest simultaneous attack\" since the conflict began.\n\nWhile meeting in Italy, the Group of Seven (G7) leaders are worried about the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing a draft statement to be released later. The G7 is currently meeting in Italy.\n\nMore than 90,000 people in southern Lebanon and 60,000 in northern Israel have been displaced by the fighting, according to reports.\n\nKnow more: Israeli tanks advanced deeper into southern Gaza's Rafah on Thursday following a night of heavy bombardment, Reuters reported, citing local residents. The Israeli military said it was continuing \"intelligence-based, targeted operations\" against Hamas in the area, according to the outlet.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken again visited the region this week as part of the Biden administration's efforts to reach a cease-fire in the conflict. The diplomat told reporters in Doha on Wednesday that Hamas responded to the latest US-backed cease-fire proposal with \"numerous changes,\" raising concerns that a deal will not get done.", "source":

Hezbollah has ratcheted up its attacks in several ways of late, sending larger numbers of explosive drones in one go, using a new type of rocket, and declaring that it has targeted Israeli warplanes for the first time - a milestone for the group, according to a source familiar with Hezbollah's arsenal.\n\nHezbollah is drawing on more of its arsenal in its conflict with Israel even as it declares no interest in a full-scale war, an escalation analysts believe aims to deter Israel from a wider confrontation but which could also risk igniting one.\n\nSparked by the Gaza war, the conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border has shifted up several gears in the last month, adding to concern the heavily armed adversaries could escalate towards a war that would be ruinous for both countries. The spectre of such a war is looming over the region as U.S.-led mediation struggles to secure a Gaza ceasefire, with increasingly bellicose rhetoric from both Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah has ratcheted up its attacks in several ways of late, sending larger numbers of explosive drones in one go, using a new type of rocket, and declaring that it has targeted Israeli warplanes for the first time - a milestone for the group, according to a source familiar with Hezbollah's arsenal. Retaliating for the killing of a senior commander by Israel, Hezbollah unleashed two days of its heaviest bombardment of the conflict so far, firing some 250 rockets at Israel on Wednesday and an even larger attack at nine Israeli military sites with rockets and drones on Thursday.\n\nMany of Wednesday's rockets appeared to have landed in open ground and set off large brush fires. Shrapnel from Thursday's attack left at least two people wounded in Israel. The escalation has tested unwritten rules that have largely confined the conflict to areas at the border or near it since October, keeping Lebanese and Israeli cities out of the firing line.\n\nIsrael said on Thursday that it holds Hezbollah and its Iranian sponsors to blame for the increase in violence and repeated vows to restore security to the border. The Israel Defence Forces did not immediately reply to a request for comment on new Hezbollah capabilities such as the claim to have targeted a warplane. The source familiar with Hezbollah's arsenal said it is still calibrating its actions with the intention of avoiding all-out war even as it has stepped up its attacks - the approach it has adopted since the conflict started.\n\nThe source said Hezbollah had begun escalating with the aim of increasing pressure on Israel as it launched an offensive in Rafah in the Gaza Strip in early May, and also with the intention of gradually unveiling more of its capabilities. This included the anti-aircraft weapons Hezbollah fired at an Israeli warplane for the first time on June 6, an effort to challenge the air supremacy Israel has long enjoyed, the source said, declining to identify the type of weapon used.\n\nHezbollah has announced four attacks targeting Israeli warplanes in the last week, saying it had forced them to leave Lebanese air space. \"Hezbollah is showing the kinds of capabilities they have\" in an effort to \"strengthen deterrence for a conventional war,\" said Seth G. Jones, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n\"The question is what kind of air defence does Hezbollah have and what more could it get from the Iranians and the Syrians. I suspect that any serious indication of serious capabilities would lead the Israelis to hit hard,\" he said. MORE 'SURPRISES'\n\nHezbollah began trading fire with Israel on Oct. 8, a day after its Palestinian ally Hamas attacked southern Israel, sparking the Gaza war. Hezbollah says it will cease fire only when the Gaza war stops. Tens of thousands of people have fled both sides of the border. Israeli strikes have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters and around 80 civilians in Lebanon, according to Reuters tallies. Attacks from Lebanon have killed 18 Israeli soldiers and 10 civilians.\n\nIsrael has pounded areas where Hezbollah operates in south Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. In Israel, the displacement of so many people has become a big political issue, piling pressure on the government to act. Prior to this conflict, Israel and Hezbollah had avoided a major clash since a month-long war in 2006, deterred since then by mutual threats of catastrophic destruction.\n\nHezbollah's arsenal has grown enormously since 2006. Hezbollah has downed five Israeli drones, flown drones at Israeli targets, and used sophisticated guided rockets that capture footage as they approach their targets, images later broadcast on the group's al-Manar TV.\n\nHezbollah fired Iranian-made Falaq 2 artillery rockets for the first time on June 8, able to carry a bigger warhead than the Falaq 1 it has fired in the past. Its rockets have also set off wildfires in northern Israel.\n\nHezbollah deputy head Naim Qassem said on June 4 the group did not seek war, but was ready to fight if one was imposed on it. He has also hinted at the weaponry the group has in reserve. \"What the party has used so far in the battle to support Gaza and proactively defend Lebanon is a small part of what it has, and there are matters whose surprises may be greater,\" he said on June 10.\n\nRESTORING LOST DETERRENCE The United States, which deems Hezbollah a terrorist group, has led diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict. A U.S. official said on Thursday Washington was very concerned about potential escalation.\n\nHezbollah has indicated its openness to diplomatic arrangements if Lebanon is to benefit, but says this can't be discussed until Israel halts the Gaza offensive. Israel has also indicated openness to a diplomatic settlement that would restore security in the north, whilst preparing for an offensive. Meanwhile, Israel has been using its air power to strike Lebanon on a near daily basis, targeting Hezbollah fighters in the south, the Bekaa Valley, and even striking Beirut on one occasion to kill a senior Hamas leader. Hezbollah wants to reestablish the deterrence that would make Israel think twice.\n\n\"They had to escalate because they lost deterrence, they need to reestablish deterrence,\" said Mohanad Hage Ali, deputy director for research at the Carnegie Middle East Center. \"But also when it comes to Israel's Rafah operation, they needed to act. They justified their participation in the war to support and show solidarity to Gaza, so they had to act.\" (Additional reporting by Tom Perry in Beirut and James Mackenzie in Jerusalem; Writing by

It has been sitting on the table for some time. Israel has not contradicted or walked that back,\" Sullivan said Thursday in Italy, where Biden was set to attend the annual Group of Seven leaders' summit. \"To this day they stand behind the proposal.\"\n\n\"I don't think that there is a contradiction in the Israeli position,\" Sullivan added.\n\nSullivan reiterated that Hamas had responded by offering an amended proposal and he said the goal is \"to figure out how we work to bridge the remaining gaps and get to a deal.\"\n\nHamas requested numerous changes this week to a U.S.-backed proposal, saying its \"amendments\" aim to guarantee a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza. The cease-fire proposal announced by Biden includes those provisions, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms.\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger because the war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies. U.N. agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\n-- Yemen's Houthi rebels launch boat-borne bomb attack against Greek-owned ship in Red Sea.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nBEIRUT -- The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said Thursday it attacked six Israeli military posts and bases with rockets and explosive drones, in a second day of attacks on northern Israel in retaliation for killing one of the group's top commanders.\n\nCross-border attacks by Israel and Hezbollah have been taking place almost daily since the war in Gaza began in October. This week's escalation comes as some Israeli leaders have threatened all-out war to silence Hezbollah's rocket fire, which has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis, and as Iran-backed Hezbollah seeks to exert pressure in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas during back-and-forth negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement it fired rockets at the six Israeli posts Thursday and simultaneously launched explosive drones at three other posts, including a main intelligence division in northern Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military said approximately 45 projectiles, including rockets and drones, were launched toward the Galilee and Golan Heights areas.\n\nIsrael's Magen David Adom rescue service said two people were lightly injured from shrapnel in the Golan Heights.\n\nThe military said many of the projectiles were successfully intercepted by the Aerial Defense Array, without giving an exact breakdown, while others hit and caused brush fires. The military said it identified at least eight aerial targets -- referring to drones -- and six were intercepted.\n\nIsrael said its warplanes bombed infrastructure used by Hezbollah in several locations in southern Lebanon on Thursday.\n\nHezbollah fired more than 200 projectiles into Israel on Wednesday, according to the army, hours after an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of the group's Nasr Unit in charge of parts of south Lebanon close to the Israeli border.\n\nHezbollah says it won't stop the attacks until there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. The Arab world's most powerful paramilitary force has been striking deeper inside Israel in recent weeks, introducing new and more advanced weaponry.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 400 people in the current round of fighting, most of them Hezbollah members, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants, and tens of thousands have been displaced from communities in the south. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed.\n\nBAGHDAD -- Iraq's top diplomat expressed concerns Thursday that Israel might escalate its military operations in Lebanon with ripple effects that could reach his country.\n\n\"There are dangerous signs that there may be an attack on southern Lebanon and if this attack happens, it will affect the region and not just Lebanon,\" Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said after a meeting with acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani in his first visit to Baghdad since taking the post. The two officials called for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nKani replaced former Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who died in a helicopter crash on May 19 along with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and a delegation of other officials.\n\nIranian-backed militias in Iraq have launched drone attacks on targets in Israel and on bases in Iraq and Syria housing U.S. troops since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, where Israeli forces are fighting against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. However, the most intense fighting outside of Gaza has been on the Lebanon-Israel border, where the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been clashing with Israeli forces almost daily for more than eight months.\n\nIn recent weeks, those clashes have intensified, with fears of a further escalation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that Israel is \"prepared for very intense action\" along its northern border with Lebanon. Should a wider conflict break out in Lebanon, the Iraqi militias are widely expected to join their ally, Hezbollah, in the fight.\n\nFASANO, Italy -- U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday pushed back against assertions that Israel isn't fully committed to the cease-fire proposal with Hamas that President Joe Biden outlined in late May at the White House.\n\n\"Israel has supplied this proposal. It has been sitting on the table for some time. Israel has not contradicted or walked that back,\" Sullivan said Thursday in Italy, where Biden was set to attend the annual Group of Seven leaders' summit. \"To this day they stand behind the proposal.\"\n\n\"I don't think that there is a contradiction in the Israeli position,\" Sullivan added.\n\nSullivan reiterated that Hamas had responded by offering an amended proposal and he said the goal is \"to figure out how we work to bridge the remaining gaps and get to a deal.\"\n\n\"The goal is to try to bring this to a conclusion as rapidly as possible,\" he told reporters.\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Weary after eight months of war, frustrated Palestinians displaced from their homes in Gaza said Wednesday they are cautiously hoping for a cease-fire.\n\nSome are more skeptical than others, as previous moments of optimism have been dashed by differences between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"We are psychologically tired,\" said Etaf Abdel Bari, a displaced woman living in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah. \"They negotiated a lot, to no avail? We are not a toy in their hands. Our sons, daughters, and families killed without a reason. For what?\"\n\nMore than 1 million people have fled Israel's invasion of the southern Gaza city Rafah, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\n\"Every day there is a truce, there is no truce. We want a solution. We want to return to our homes,\" said a displaced man, Salama Abu al-Qumbuz. \"We are tired of this life, sleeping in the street, transporting water. Our lives have become very boring.\"\n\nThe United Nations says over one million people in Gaza face desperate hunger and don't have enough clean drinking water.\n\nOther residents of Deir al-Balah took a more cynical view of the back-and-forth truce talks.\n\n\"I expect the war to continue. There are no negotiations,\" said Abu Jamil al-Maqadma. \"The negotiations are false.\"\n\nDOHA, Qatar -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that mediators would keep trying to close an elusive cease-fire deal after Hamas proposed numerous changes to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were \"workable\" and some not.\n\nThe back-and-forth laid bare frustration over the difficulty of reaching an accord that can bring an end to eight months of war that has decimated Gaza, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left scores of Israeli hostages still languishing in militant captivity. Previous moments of optimism have been repeatedly dashed by the differences between the two sides.\n\nThe cease-fire proposal has global support but has not been fully embraced by Israel or Hamas. Blinken did not spell out what changes Hamas was seeking but he said the mediators -- Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. -- will keep trying to \"close this deal.\" He put the onus on Hamas, accusing it of changing its demands.\n\n\"Hamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table. ... Some of the changes are workable. Some are not,\" Blinken told reporters in Qatar. \"I believe that they (the differences) are bridgeable, but that doesn't mean they will be bridged because ultimately Hamas has to decide.\"\n\nThe Palestinian militant group says the \"amendments\" aim to guarantee a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nThose provisions are included in the proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms. And although the U.S. says Israel has accepted the proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given conflicting statements, saying Israel is still intent on its goal of destroying Hamas.\n\nThe proposal's three-phase plan would begin with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes. Aid distribution would also increase.\n\nAt the same time, negotiations would start over the second phase, which is to bring \"a permanent end to hostilities\" and \"full withdrawal\" of Israeli troops from Gaza in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages.\n\nA major hitch for both sides appears to be the negotiations for the second phase. Phase three would see the launch of a reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of remains of deceased hostages.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated

Some projectiles were intercepted, while others ignited brush fires.\n\nFires have become common on both sides of the border as the dry summer heat has begun.\n\n\"It is natural that Abu Taleb was a permanent target,\" Mr Saffieddine said of the commander, the most senior Hezbollah leader to be killed since October.\n\nMr Abdallah is among 300 Hezbollah fighters to have been killed since the conflict broke out, but one of only two who the group has formally referred to as a commander.\n\nMore information has since been released about Mr Abdallah, who was the commander of the Nasr Unit, which is responsible for part of the border area.\n\nHe was described by Mr Saffieddine as an important leader in the 2006 Hezbollah-Israel war, the last time the two sides fought a full-on conflict.\n\nThe conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border was also the subject of discussions in Baghdad on Thursday.\n\nIraq and Iran's foreign ministers discussed the \"dangerous signs\" of Israel possibly attacking Lebanon, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said after meeting with visiting Iranian Acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani.\n\n\"If there is an attack on southern Lebanon, God forbid, it will affect the whole region,\" Mr Hussein said during a press conference in Baghdad. He warned that \"expanding the war is not only a danger to Lebanon but to the entire region\".\n\nMr Bagheri Kani said \"the Zionists, due to their failure in Gaza, might make another mistake and expand their aggression\". Both countries called for an immediate ceasefire in the continuing war in Gaza.

Hezbollah fires more than 200 missiles and rockets across its southern border in one of its heaviest attacks on northern Israel since the 2006 war.\n\nThe day before, Israel had assassinated Taleb Abdullah, the most senior Hezbollah commander killed since October 8.\n\nWhat happened Wednesday and Tuesday is the latest intensification of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon, as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas seem to be coming to a head.\n\nIsrael has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians in Gaza since October 7, the day Hamas led an attack on Israel, killing 1,139 people and capturing some 240.\n\nIsrael faces genocide charges for its actions in Gaza in a case brought to the International Criminal of Justice by South Africa.\n\nAnalysts told Al Jazeera a Gaza ceasefire could shift Israel's military focus to Lebanon, where it has exchanged attacks with Hezbollah since the day after Ocotber 7.\n\nThe exchanges across Lebanon's southern border are not exactly tit-for-tat.\n\nAl Jazeera found in an April investigation that Israel had launched more than five attacks on Lebanon for every attack from Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael has killed about 300 Hezbollah members and more than 70 civilians during this time, while Israel says it has lost about 15 soldiers and 10 civilians.\n\nWhile tensions are increasing along the border, analysts believe Israel would struggle to widen the war on Lebanon without first a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\"The Israelis will not enlarge their fight with Lebanon as long as there is [still] one single shot in Gaza,\" Tannous Mouawad, a retired brigadier general in the Lebanese army, told Al Jazeera. \"When [a ceasefire is achieved in] Gaza, the Israelis will definitely turn towards Lebanon.\"\n\nThe Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is under domestic pressure tas the school year approaches and more than 90,000 people remain displaced from their homes in northern Israel.\n\nPoliticians say Hezbollah needs to be pushed back from the border before civilians can safely return - although many have reportedly decided not to come back.\n\nNetanyahu said last week that Israel is \"prepared for a very intense operation\" on the border with Lebanon.\n\n\"An opinion poll published by [Israeli newspaper] Maariv ... showed [that] over 70 percent of Israelis want to do away with Hezbollah,\" Karim Emile Bitar, professor of international relations at Saint Joseph's University in Beirut, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"Several members of the [Israeli] war cabinet also share this hawkish position.\"\n\n\"We are approaching the point where a decision will have to be made, and the [Israeli military] is prepared and very ready for this decision,\" chief of staff of Israel's army, Herzi Halevi, told military officials in early June.\n\nA push for war against Hezbollah and Lebanon does not mean an assured victory for Israel.\n\nBitar said any war would be \"extraordinarily counterproductive\" and could inflict heavy suffering on both the Lebanese and Israelis.\n\n\"[It will not be] a walk in the park [for Israel],\" he added. \"The idea that they could occupy south Lebanon shows that they have learned nothing from Israeli history.\"\n\nIsrael invaded south Lebanon in 1978 and 1982 during the country's civil war, aiming to push out Palestinian groups.\n\nHezbollah itself, a Lebanese Shia group with close ties to Iran, was formed in 1982 in response to Israel's invasion.\n\nIsrael also occupied south Lebanon from 1985 until 2000, after Hezbollah and other Lebanese forces pushed Israeli troops back across the border.\n\nAn invasion would likely give Israel \"much more than it bargained for\" Bitar said.\n\nToday, Hezbollah is generally believed to be the world's strongest non-state actor, which means its military capabilities are significantly stronger than those of Hamas.\n\nUntil now, it has largely struck military targets near the north of Israel but, analysts say, it striking military targets in areas like Tel Aviv, which is surrounded by civilian infrastructure, would be more problematic for Israel.\n\n\"There's [already] a rift in Israel itself with northern settlers furious at the government,\" Amal Saad, author of the book Hizbu'llah Politics and Religion, told Al Jazeera.\n\nRaining rockets down on a populated city could be a way \"to deepen preexisting divides and showcase what the rest of Israel can look like,\" she said. \"Israel cannot tolerate a fraction of what Gaza or Lebanon can.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Hezbollah has also used new weapons not previously utilised on the battlefield, including anti-aircraft missiles, which it claimed forced Israeli fighter jets to retreat.\n\nThis move was \"symbolic\", according to Saad, because it \"challenged Israeli's aerial supremacy\". Hezbollah has also downed a number of Israeli drones in recent weeks.\n\nOf course, a wider war in Lebanon could come with serious consequences for both Israel and Lebanon.\n\nUS officials have warned that an escalation against Hezbollah could draw in Iran and other allied forces in the region.\n\nAnd Lebanon, with its collapsed economy, would surely be left in an even worse state. A war would bring \"extra large destruction by Israel on Lebanon\", said Mouawad, the retired brigadier general.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"},

That has raised fears of a regional conflagration.\n\nAbdullah, 55, was killed in an airstrike late Tuesday. On Wednesday afternoon, his coffin was brought to Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut. Hundreds of Hezbollah supporters and senior officials with the militant group attended the ceremony. The body was taken for burial in Abdullah's hometown of Aadschit.\n\n\"It is natural that Abu Taleb was a permanent target,\" Saffieddine said, adding that Abdullah had taken part in Hezbollah's military operations including the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.\n\nAir raid sirens sounded across northern Israel on Wednesday morning, and the military said about 160 projectiles were fired from southern Lebanon -- one of the largest attacks since the latest fighting began. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Some projectiles were intercepted, while others ignited brush fires.\n\nHezbollah said it fired missiles and rockets at two military bases in retaliation for Abdullah's killing.\n\nThe Israeli strike on Tuesday destroyed a house where Abdullah and three other officials were meeting, about 6 miles from the border. The Israeli military said the attack was part of a strike on a Hezbollah command and control center used to direct attacks against Israel in recent months.\n\n\"Abdullah was one of Hezbollah's most senior commanders in southern Lebanon who planned, advanced and carried out\" a large number of attacks against Israeli civilians, the military said.\n\nA Hezbollah official told The Associated Press that Abdullah was in charge of a large part of the Lebanon-Israel front, including the area facing the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, which Hezbollah has repeatedly attacked in recent days.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to speak to media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Abdullah had joined Hezbollah decades ago and took part in attacks against Israeli forces during their 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon that ended in May 2000.\n\nAnother Hezbollah official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said Abdullah was the commander of the group's Nasr Unit that is charge of parts of south Lebanon close to the Israeli border.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed over 400 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed since the war in Gaza began.\n\nHezbollah fighters carry the coffin of their comrade, senior commander Taleb Sami Abdullah, 55, known within Hezbollah as Hajj Abu Taleb, who was killed late Tusday by an Israeli strike in south Lebanon, during his funeral procession in the southern suburbs of Beirut, Lebanon, Wednesday, June 12, 2024.

Footage appears to show IDF soldiers firing the trebuchet right next to the Lebanese border as it fires the flaming projectile over the border, right into Lebanese plantations.\n\n'This is a local initiative and not a tool that is widely used,' the military told Israeli state broadcaster KAN News. 'The area on the Lebanese border is characterised by boulders, thickets, and dense thorn vegetation, which poses a challenge to the IDF troops deployed in defense,' the IDF added as a reason for launching the fireballs.\n\nThe trebuchet was commonly used during the Middle Ages in sieges involving castles and other fortified locations, with large stones and projectiles being launched at enemy lines. Another video posted to X appears to show an IDF soldier as she shoots a flaming arrow over the border to Lebanon.\n\nThis comes as Lebanon-based terror group Hezbollah said it had launched rockets and weaponised drones at nine Israeli military sites in a coordinated attack today. The attacks were carried out in retaliation for an Israeli strike on Tuesday that killed a senior Hezbollah field commander.\n\nA security source told Lebanon it was the largest attack waged by Hezbollah since October, when the group started exchanging fire with Israel in parallel with the Gaza war. Hezbollah said in a statement it had fired volleys of Katyusha and Falaq rockets at six Israeli military locations. Its Al-Manar television reported more than 100 rockets fired at once.\n\nHezbollah's statement said it had also launched attack drones at the headquarters of Israel's northern command, an intelligence headquarters and a military barracks. A security source told Reuters that involved firing at least 30 attack drones at once, making it the group's largest drone attack to date in the eight-month-old war.\n\nThe Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel have been trading near-daily fire since the eruption of the Gaza war in October, but the last two days have seen a sharp rise following the Israeli strike that killed the Hezbollah commander. Israeli strikes have killed more than 300 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon - more than it lost in 2006, when the sides last fought a major war, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nThe number of civilians killed is around 80, the tally says. Attacks from Lebanon have killed 18 Israeli soldiers and 10 civilians, Israel says. The exchanges of fire have also displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border.\n\n'Diplomatically or militarily, peace will be returned to our north. Israel will defend itself. There should not be any doubt about this whatsoever. This [situation] cannot be a sustained reality,' Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said. G7 leaders meeting in Italy said in a draft communique that they were very concerned by the situation on the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The cease-fire proposal announced by Biden includes those provisions, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms.\n\nIsrael's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 37,100 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Palestinians are facing widespread hunger because the war has largely cut off the flow of food, medicine and other supplies. U.N. agencies say over 1 million in Gaza could experience the highest level of starvation by mid-July.\n\nIsrael launched the war after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- What are the main sticking points in the cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas?\n\n-- Report by UN-backed experts cites crimes by Israeli forces and Palestinian militants starting 0ct. 7.\n\n-- Hezbollah vows to intensify attacks against Israel after an airstrike kills a senior commander.\n\n-- Blinken says some of Hamas' proposed changes to a cease-fire plan in Gaza are workable and some are not.\n\n-- Yemen's Houthi rebels launch boat-borne bomb attack against Greek-owned ship in Red Sea.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHezbollah attacks Israeli bases with rockets and drones in second day of retaliation for killing militant commander\n\nBEIRUT -- The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said Thursday it attacked six Israeli military posts and bases with rockets and explosive drones, in a second day of attacks on northern Israel in retaliation for killing one of the group's top commanders.\n\nCross-border attacks by Israel and Hezbollah have been taking place almost daily since the war in Gaza began in October. This week's escalation comes as some Israeli leaders have threatened all-out war to silence Hezbollah's rocket fire, which has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis, and as Iran-backed Hezbollah seeks to exert pressure in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas during back-and-forth negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement it fired rockets at the six Israeli posts Thursday and simultaneously launched explosive drones at three other posts, including a main intelligence division in northern Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military said approximately 45 projectiles, including rockets and drones, were launched toward the Galilee and Golan Heights areas.\n\nIsrael's Magen David Adom rescue service said two people were lightly injured from shrapnel in the Golan Heights.\n\nThe military said many of the projectiles were successfully intercepted by the Aerial Defense Array, without giving an exact breakdown, while others hit and caused brush fires. The military said it identified at least eight aerial targets -- referring to drones -- and six were intercepted.\n\nIsrael said its warplanes bombed infrastructure used by Hezbollah in several locations in southern Lebanon on Thursday.\n\nHezbollah fired more than 200 projectiles into Israel on Wednesday, according to the army, hours after an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of the group's Nasr Unit in charge of parts of south Lebanon close to the Israeli border.\n\nHezbollah says it won't stop the attacks until there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. The Arab world's most powerful paramilitary force has been striking deeper inside Israel in recent weeks, introducing new and more advanced weaponry.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 400 people in the current round of fighting, most of them Hezbollah members, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants, and tens of thousands have been displaced from communities in the south. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed.\n\nIraq's top diplomat says he is concerned Israel might escalate military action in Lebanon\n\nBAGHDAD -- Iraq's top diplomat expressed concerns Thursday that Israel might escalate its military operations in Lebanon with ripple effects that could reach his country.\n\n\"There are dangerous signs that there may be an attack on southern Lebanon and if this attack happens, it will affect the region and not just Lebanon,\" Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said after a meeting with acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani in his first visit to Baghdad since taking the post. The two officials called for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nKani replaced former Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who died in a helicopter crash on May 19 along with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and a delegation of other officials.\n\nIranian-backed militias in Iraq have launched drone attacks on targets in Israel and on bases in Iraq and Syria housing U.S. troops since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, where Israeli forces are fighting against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. However, the most intense fighting outside of Gaza has been on the Lebanon-Israel border, where the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been clashing with Israeli forces almost daily for more than eight months.\n\nIn recent weeks, those clashes have intensified, with fears of a further escalation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that Israel is \"prepared for very intense action\" along its northern border with Lebanon. Should a wider conflict break out in Lebanon, the Iraqi militias are widely expected to join their ally, Hezbollah, in the fight.\n\nUS national security adviser says Israel stands behind cease-fire proposal\n\nFASANO, Italy -- U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday pushed back against assertions that Israel isn't fully committed to the cease-fire proposal with Hamas that President Joe Biden outlined in late May at the White House.\n\n\"Israel has supplied this proposal. It has been sitting on the table for some time. Israel has not contradicted or walked that back,\" Sullivan said Thursday in Italy, where Biden was set to attend the annual Group of Seven leaders' summit. \"To this day they stand behind the proposal.\"\n\n\"I don't think that there is a contradiction in the Israeli position,\" Sullivan added.\n\nSullivan reiterated that Hamas had responded by offering an amended proposal and he said the goal is \"to figure out how we work to bridge the remaining gaps and get to a deal.\"\n\n\"The goal is to try to bring this to a conclusion as rapidly as possible,\" he told reporters.\n\nVoices of displaced Palestinians in Gaza: jaded hopes for a cease-fire despite war's bloody toll\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Weary after eight months of war, frustrated Palestinians displaced from their homes in Gaza said Wednesday they are cautiously hoping for a cease-fire.\n\nSome are more skeptical than others, as previous moments of optimism have been dashed by differences between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"We are psychologically tired,\" said Etaf Abdel Bari, a displaced woman living in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah. \"They negotiated a lot, to no avail? We are not a toy in their hands. Our sons, daughters, and families killed without a reason. For what?\"\n\nMore than 1 million people have fled Israel's invasion of the southern Gaza city Rafah, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\n\"Every day there is a truce, there is no truce. We want a solution. We want to return to our homes,\" said a displaced man, Salama Abu al-Qumbuz. \"We are tired of this life, sleeping in the street, transporting water. Our lives have become very boring.\"\n\nThe United Nations says over one million people in Gaza face desperate hunger and don't have enough clean drinking water.\n\nOther residents of Deir al-Balah took a more cynical view of the back-and-forth truce talks.\n\n\"I expect the war to continue. There are no negotiations,\" said Abu Jamil al-Maqadma. \"The negotiations are false.\"\n\nBlinken says some of Hamas' proposed changes to a cease-fire plan in Gaza are workable and some not\n\nDOHA, Qatar -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that mediators would keep trying to close an elusive cease-fire deal after Hamas proposed numerous changes to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were \"workable\" and some not.\n\nThe back-and-forth laid bare frustration over the difficulty of reaching an accord that can bring an end to eight months of war that has decimated Gaza, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left scores of Israeli hostages still languishing in militant captivity. Previous moments of optimism have been repeatedly dashed by the differences between the two sides.\n\nThe cease-fire proposal has global support but has not been fully embraced by Israel or Hamas. Blinken did not spell out what changes Hamas was seeking but he said the mediators -- Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. -- will keep trying to \"close this deal.\" He put the onus on Hamas, accusing it of changing its demands.\n\n\"Hamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table. ... Some of the changes are workable. Some are not,\" Blinken told reporters in Qatar. \"I believe that they (the differences) are bridgeable, but that doesn't mean they will be bridged because ultimately Hamas has to decide.\"\n\nThe Palestinian militant group says the \"amendments\" aim to guarantee a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nThose provisions are included in the proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms. And although the U.S. says Israel has accepted the proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given conflicting statements, saying Israel is still intent on its goal of destroying Hamas.\n\nThe proposal's three-phase plan would begin with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes. Aid distribution would also increase.\n\nAt the same time, negotiations would start over the second phase, which is to bring \"a permanent end to hostilities\" and \"full withdrawal\" of Israeli troops from Gaza in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages.\n\nA major hitch for both sides appears to be the negotiations for the second phase.

That has raised fears of a regional conflagration.\n\nAbdullah, 55, was killed in an airstrike late Tuesday, together with three other senior officers: Selim Sopan, Muhammad Sabra and Hussain Hamid.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Abdullah's coffin was brought to Hezbollah's stronghold in southern Beirut. Hundreds of Hezbollah supporters and senior officials with the terrorist group attended the ceremony. The body was taken for burial in Abdullah's hometown of Aadschit.\"It is natural that Abu Taleb was a permanent target,\" Saffieddine said, adding that Abdullah had taken part in Hezbollah's military operations including the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.\n\nAir raid sirens sounded across northern Israel on Wednesday morning, and the military said about 215 projectiles were fired from southern Lebanon -- one of the largest attacks since the latest fighting began. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Some projectiles were intercepted, while others ignited brush fires.\n\nHezbollah said it fired missiles and rockets at two military bases in retaliation for Abdullah's killing.\n\nThe Israeli strike on Tuesday destroyed a house where Abdullah and three other officials were meeting, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border. The Israeli military said the attack was part of a strike on a Hezbollah command and control center used to direct attacks against Israel in recent months.\n\n\"Abdullah was one of Hezbollah's most senior commanders in southern Lebanon who planned, advanced and carried out\" a large number of attacks against Israeli civilians, the military said.\n\nA Hezbollah official told The Associated Press that Abdullah was in charge of a large part of the Lebanon-Israel front, including the area facing the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, which Hezbollah has repeatedly attacked in recent days.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to speak to media and spoke on condition of anonymity, said Abdullah had joined Hezbollah decades ago and took part in attacks against Israeli forces during their 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon that ended in May 2000.\n\nAnother Hezbollah official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said Abdullah was the commander of the group's Nasr Unit that is in charge of parts of south Lebanon close to the Israeli border.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon since October have killed over 400 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants.

This week's escalation comes as some Israeli leaders have threatened all-out war to silence Hezbollah's rocket fire, which has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis, and as Iran-backed Hezbollah seeks to exert pressure in support of its Palestinian ally Hamas during back-and-forth negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement it fired rockets at the six Israeli posts Thursday and simultaneously launched explosive drones at three other posts, including a main intelligence division in northern Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military said approximately 45 projectiles, including rockets and drones, were launched toward the Galilee and Golan Heights areas.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsrael's Magen David Adom rescue service said two people were lightly injured from shrapnel in the Golan Heights.\n\nThe military said many of the projectiles were successfully intercepted by the Aerial Defense Array, without giving an exact breakdown, while others hit and caused brush fires. The military said it identified at least eight aerial targets -- referring to drones -- and six were intercepted.\n\nIsrael said its warplanes bombed infrastructure used by Hezbollah in several locations in southern Lebanon on Thursday.\n\nHezbollah fired more than 200 projectiles into Israel on Wednesday, according to the army, hours after an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed Taleb Sami Abdullah, the commander of the group's Nasr Unit in charge of parts of south Lebanon close to the Israeli border.\n\nHezbollah says it won't stop the attacks until there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip. The Arab world's most powerful paramilitary force has been striking deeper inside Israel in recent weeks, introducing new and more advanced weaponry.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Lebanon have killed over 400 people in the current round of fighting, most of them Hezbollah members, but the dead also include more than 70 civilians and non-combatants, and tens of thousands have been displaced from communities in the south. On the Israeli side, 15 soldiers and 10 civilians have been killed.\n\nIraq's top diplomat says he is concerned Israel might escalate military action in Lebanon\n\nBAGHDAD -- Iraq's top diplomat expressed concerns Thursday that Israel might escalate its military operations in Lebanon with ripple effects that could reach his country.\n\n\"There are dangerous signs that there may be an attack on southern Lebanon and if this attack happens, it will affect the region and not just Lebanon,\" Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said after a meeting with acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani in his first visit to Baghdad since taking the post. The two officials called for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nKani replaced former Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who died in a helicopter crash on May 19 along with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and a delegation of other officials.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIranian-backed militias in Iraq have launched drone attacks on targets in Israel and on bases in Iraq and Syria housing U.S. troops since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, where Israeli forces are fighting against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. However, the most intense fighting outside of Gaza has been on the Lebanon-Israel border, where the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been clashing with Israeli forces almost daily for more than eight months.\n\nIn recent weeks, those clashes have intensified, with fears of a further escalation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that Israel is \"prepared for very intense action\" along its northern border with Lebanon. Should a wider conflict break out in Lebanon, the Iraqi militias are widely expected to join their ally, Hezbollah, in the fight.\n\nUS national security adviser says Israel stands behind cease-fire proposal\n\nFASANO, Italy -- U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Thursday pushed back against assertions that Israel isn't fully committed to the cease-fire proposal with Hamas that President Joe Biden outlined in late May at the White House.\n\n\"Israel has supplied this proposal. It has been sitting on the table for some time. Israel has not contradicted or walked that back,\" Sullivan said Thursday in Italy, where Biden was set to attend the annual Group of Seven leaders' summit. \"To this day they stand behind the proposal.\"\n\n\"I don't think that there is a contradiction in the Israeli position,\" Sullivan added.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSullivan reiterated that Hamas had responded by offering an amended proposal and he said the goal is \"to figure out how we work to bridge the remaining gaps and get to a deal.\"\n\n\"The goal is to try to bring this to a conclusion as rapidly as possible,\" he told reporters.\n\nVoices of displaced Palestinians in Gaza: jaded hopes for a cease-fire despite war's bloody toll\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Weary after eight months of war, frustrated Palestinians displaced from their homes in Gaza said Wednesday they are cautiously hoping for a cease-fire.\n\nSome are more skeptical than others, as previous moments of optimism have been dashed by differences between Israel and Hamas.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We are psychologically tired,\" said Etaf Abdel Bari, a displaced woman living in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah. \"They negotiated a lot, to no avail? We are not a toy in their hands. Our sons, daughters, and families killed without a reason. For what?\"\n\nMore than 1 million people have fled Israel's invasion of the southern Gaza city Rafah, scattering across southern and central Gaza into new tent camps or crowding into schools and homes.\n\n\"Every day there is a truce, there is no truce. We want a solution. We want to return to our homes,\" said a displaced man, Salama Abu al-Qumbuz. \"We are tired of this life, sleeping in the street, transporting water. Our lives have become very boring.\"\n\nThe United Nations says over one million people in Gaza face desperate hunger and don't have enough clean drinking water.\n\nOther residents of Deir al-Balah took a more cynical view of the back-and-forth truce talks.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I expect the war to continue. There are no negotiations,\" said Abu Jamil al-Maqadma. \"The negotiations are false.\"\n\nBlinken says some of Hamas' proposed changes to a cease-fire plan in Gaza are workable and some not\n\nDOHA, Qatar -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that mediators would keep trying to close an elusive cease-fire deal after Hamas proposed numerous changes to a U.S.-backed plan, some of which he said were \"workable\" and some not.\n\nThe back-and-forth laid bare frustration over the difficulty of reaching an accord that can bring an end to eight months of war that has decimated Gaza, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and left scores of Israeli hostages still languishing in militant captivity. Previous moments of optimism have been repeatedly dashed by the differences between the two sides.\n\nThe cease-fire proposal has global support but has not been fully embraced by Israel or Hamas. Blinken did not spell out what changes Hamas was seeking but he said the mediators -- Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. -- will keep trying to \"close this deal.\" He put the onus on Hamas, accusing it of changing its demands.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Hamas has proposed numerous changes to the proposal that was on the table. ... Some of the changes are workable. Some are not,\" Blinken told reporters in Qatar. \"I believe that they (the differences) are bridgeable, but that doesn't mean they will be bridged because ultimately Hamas has to decide.\"\n\nThe Palestinian militant group says the \"amendments\" aim to guarantee a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nThose provisions are included in the proposal announced by U.S. President Joe Biden, but Hamas has expressed wariness whether Israel will implement the terms. And although the U.S. says Israel has accepted the proposal, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given conflicting statements, saying Israel is still intent on its goal of destroying Hamas.\n\nThe proposal's three-phase plan would begin with a six-week cease-fire and the release of some hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas and Palestinian civilians would be allowed to return to their homes. Aid distribution would also increase.\n\nAt the same time, negotiations would start over the second phase, which is to bring \"a permanent end to hostilities\" and \"full withdrawal\" of Israeli troops from Gaza in exchange for the release of all remaining hostages.\n\nA major hitch for both sides appears to be the negotiations for the second phase. Phase three would see the launch of a reconstruction plan for Gaza and the return of remains of deceased hostages.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"},

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIsraeli tanks advanced deeper into the western area of the border city of Rafah in Gaza, amid one of the worst nights of bombardment from air, ground, and sea, forcing many families to flee their homes and tents under darkness, residents have said.\n\nResidents said the Israeli forces thrust towards the Al-Mawasi area of Rafah near the beach, which is designated as a humanitarian area in all announcements and maps published by the Israeli army since it began its Rafah offensive in May.\n\nThe Israeli military denied in a statement it had launched any strikes inside the Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone.\n\nIsrael said its assault aimed to wipe out Hamas' last intact combat units in Rafah, a city which had sheltered more than a million people before the latest advance began. Most of those people have now moved north towards Khan Younis and Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Israeli military said in a statement it was continuing \"intelligence-based, targeted operations\" on Rafah, saying forces in the past day had located weapons and killed Palestinian gunmen in close-range combat.\n\nOver the past day, the military said it had struck 45 targets across the Gaza Strip from the air, including military structures, militant cells, rocket launchers and tunnel shafts.\n\nIsrael has ruled out peace until Hamas is eradicated, and much of Gaza lies in ruins. But Hamas militants keep resurfacing to fight in areas where Israeli forces had previously declared to have defeated them and pulled back.\n\nHamas welcomed a new US ceasefire proposal but made some amendments, reaffirming its stance that any agreement must secure an end to the war, a demand Israel still rejects.\n\nIsrael described Hamas's response to the new US peace proposal as total rejection. But the efforts to secure an agreement are still continuing, according to mediators Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States.\n\nSince a brief week-long truce in November, repeated attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on a permanent end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nHamas triggered the war when it stormed from Israeli-blockaded Gaza into southern Israel in attack on 7 October last year, killing around 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages back to the enclave..\n\nIsrael's invasion and bombardment of Gaza that followed has killed at least 37,000 people, according to the territory's health ministry. Thousands more are feared buried dead under rubble, with most of the 2.3 million population displaced.\n\nMeanwhile, Hezbollah said it had launched rockets and weaponised drones at nine Israeli military sites in a coordinated attack on Thursday, ramping up hostilities on Lebanon's southern border for the second consecutive day.\n\nThe attacks were carried out in retaliation for an Israeli strike on Tuesday that killed a senior Hezbollah field commander. A security source told Lebanon it was the largest attack waged by Hezbollah since October, when the group started exchanging fire with Israel in parallel with the Gaza war.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement it had fired volleys of Katyusha and Falaq rockets at six Israeli military locations. The statement said it had also launched attack drones at the headquarters of Israel's northern command, an intelligence headquarters and a military barracks.\n\nA security source told Reuters that involved firing at least 30 attack drones at once, making it the group's largest drone attack to date in the eight-month-old war. The Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel have been trading near-daily fire since the eruption of the Gaza war, but the last two days have seen a sharp rise following the Israeli strike that killed the Hezbollah commander.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyusha_rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katyusha rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/13/17/newFile-3.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9645854", "eventUri": "eng-9645854", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2313, "textEnd": 2322}], "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Another 100 missiles were fired into northern Israel early on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh urged calm, the latest American appeal for both sides to de-escalate and avoid a conflict that may spark a larger regional war.\n\n\"We are seeing an increase in activity in the north, and we don't want things to escalate into a broader regional conflict, and that's something that is not new,\" Singh told journalists at a press briefing.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant -- who may end up the subject of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant linked to IDF conduct inside Gaza -- discussed the issue in a call this week, Singh said.\n\nTortuous ceasefire talks have yet to yield a deal, but Singh said she believed that a pause in the fighting in Gaza \"would certainly lead to a de-escalation of tensions, but that is something that's still being worked.\"\n\nCross-border fire has been near constant since Hamas' October 7 attack on southern Israel, with Hezbollah -- a fellow member of the Iranian-led \"Axis of Resistance\" -- launching attacks in support of the Palestinian militant group and demanding a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\n\nSkirmishes have since increased in scale, while Israel has also conducted multiple assassinations of top Hezbollah and Hamas officials within Lebanon, both in the southern region controlled by the group and in the capital of Beirut.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week said the IDF is \"prepared for an extremely powerful action in the north\" into Lebanon while on a visit to the frontier area.\n\nIsraeli troops have been training for a possible incursion into southern Lebanon for several months, some being withdrawn from combat in the Gaza Strip to prepare for potential war on the northern front.\n\nHezbollah has vowed to continue attacks until an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel is demanding that Hezbollah pull back its forces north of the Litani River, which is around 18 miles north of the Israeli border, per the 2006 United Nations Security Council resolution that sought to end the last major clash between the two sides.\n\n\"There will be damage\" in the event of a war, Eyal Hulata, who served as the national security adviser to Prime Ministers Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, told Newsweek. \"Our defenses are good when we're awake. Unfortunately, on October 7, we were not alert. But when we are alert, I think our defenses work very well. This doesn't mean there won't be casualties.\"\n\nWhile the U.S. and others are seeking calm, Hulata said he is skeptical of any diplomatic solution. \"I think really, it's more a matter of when than a matter of if,\" he said.\n\nWith some 200,000 Israelis evacuated from their homes in the north due to the Hezbollah attacks, Hulata said the domestic political pressure to resolve the situation is intense.\n\n\"If Hezbollah is not going to remove their forces from the border -- and I don't see any political agreement brokered by the Americans or the French or anyone else that would be robust enough over time to keep Hezbollah away from our borders -- unfortunately, I think that it's just a matter of time until we will need to do it ourselves,\" he said.\n\n\"By September, it's going to be almost a full year that they haven't been in their homes; that's inconceivable for our country,\" Hulata added. \"We cannot continue this attrition.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType":

ceasefire proposals that would end the Gaza war, adding Washington's stance on Israel's operations there were \"truly upsetting\" Turkiye.\n\nMeanwhile, Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group said it

fire between it and the Israeli army since its ally Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war.\n\nHezbollah fighters launched \"an attack with rockets and drones, targeting six barracks and military sites\" while simultaneously flying \"squadrons of explosive-laden drones\" at three other Israeli bases, the group said in a statement.\n\nOne of the targets included an Israeli base that Hezbollah said housed an intelligence headquarters \"responsible for the assassinations.\"\n\nHezbollah said the attacks were \"part of the response to the assassination\" of Hezbollah

The aim of the incendiary attacks is to clear these areas of vegetation that Hezbollah, an Iran-backed ally of the Palestinian Hamas group, might use for cover.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week said the IDF is \"prepared for an extremely powerful action in the north,\" suggesting Israel may widen its offensive in Gaza to its border with Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli troops have been training for a possible incursion into southern Lebanon for several months, some being withdrawn from combat in Gaza to prepare for potential war on the northern front.\n\nThe use of a trebuchet follows recent heightened tensions in northern Israel.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Lebanese militia vowed to intensify its attacks along the Lebanon-Israel border to avenge the recent killing of Sami Taleb Abdullah, its most senior military commander who was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon.\n\nThis was followed by Hezbollah firing a heavy barrage of around 250 rockets into northern Israel, marking the largest single-day attack since the current conflict began, and the first-time rockets reached as far south as Tiberias.\n\nIn response, Netanyahu ordered airstrikes targeting Hezbollah military structures in southern Lebanon. These actions are part of a broader strategy to counter the frequent rocket and drone attacks from the Lebanese group, which have caused significant disruption and danger to northern Israeli communities.\n\nAccording to Israeli officials who spoke to Newsweek, some 60,000 Israelis and 100,000 Lebanese residents have been displaced from both sides of the border since October 7.\n\nIsrael is still reeling from the unprecedented attack led by Hamas that took the nation by surprise eight months ago, sparking what has become the longest and deadliest war in Gaza.\n\nAttention is increasingly being drawn to the escalating battle in the north between the IDF and Hezbollah, which has dramatically improved its arsenal since the last full-scale war fought 18 years ago.\n\nThe Alma Institute, a research organization focused on security threats in the Middle East, has estimated that Hezbollah possesses a substantial arsenal, including 150,000 mortars, 65,000 rockets with a range of up to 50 miles, and 2,500 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).\n\nThe U.S. on Wednesday urged a de-escalation along the Israel-Lebanon border. \"We don't want to see a wider regional conflict and we do want to see a de-escalation of tensions in the region,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant -- who may end up the subject of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant linked to IDF conduct inside Gaza -- discussed the issue in a call this week, Singh said.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType":

by the Lebanese Hezbollah group at northern Israel posed a threat to \"strategic sites\" and facilities in the country, Israel's Haaretz daily reported Wednesday, citing an Israeli official.\n\nFire and Rescue Services North District Commander Yair Elkayam noted that teams from the Fire Authority, the Nature and Parks Authority and the Israeli army are close to gaining control of fires in the northern Israeli towns of Biriya, Kadita, Ein Zeitim and Tziv'on.\n\n\"Air defenses and fighter jets intercepted two suspicious aerial objects moments ago in the Mount Hermon area from Lebanon,\" the army said on X.\n\n\"As a result of the interception operation's shrapnel, a fire broke out in the area, and sirens were activated according to standard procedure,\" it added.\n\nThe statement also noted that \"during the incident, another interception missile was launched towards the objects and exploded in the sky in the Safed area, where rocket shrapnel caused a fire in the vicinity.\"\n\nAccording to Israeli Army Radio, around 215 rockets and drones were fired by Hezbollah from southern Lebanon into northern Israel since Wednesday morning, in the largest attack since the outbreak of cross-border clashes between the two sides last October.\n\nIt followed the death of four Hezbollah fighters, including a senior commander, in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday night.\n\nTensions have flared along Lebanon's border with Israel amid cross-border attacks between Hezbollah and Israeli forces as Tel Aviv pressed ahead with its deadly offensive on the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 37,200 people since last Oct. 7 following a cross-border attack by the Palestinian group Hamas.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Hezbollah has been targeting Israel with rockets, drones, and missiles since October 8, 2023, when it chose to back Hamas's war. Hezbollah attacks usually average about a dozen or more projectiles daily, in contrast to the more than 215 launched on June 12.\n\nHezbollah began the barrage in the morning in the wake of an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah commander Taleb Sami Abdullah on the evening of June 11. Abdullah, a commander of an important sector for Hezbollah south of the Litani River along the Israeli border, was the most senior of the group's leaders killed in eight months of clashes. The IDF stated he \"Planned, advanced, and carried out a large number of terror attacks against Israeli civilians over many years\" and noted that the strike also killed three other Hezbollah operatives.\n\nAlthough the killing of Abdullah was the immediate reason for Hezbollah launching a high volume of rockets on June 12, the group has been escalating attacks over the last month. In May, it increased its use of kamikaze drones and anti-tank missiles. In the first week and a half of June, the group also increased the range of its attacks inside Israel, targeting coastal cities such as Acre, Nahariya, and Haifa, which is 19 miles south of the Lebanese border. On June 12, Hezbollah expanded this attack distance even further, targeting the Israeli city of Tiberias and communities along the Sea of Galilee, around 25 miles south of the Lebanese border.\n\nHezbollah's attacks on Israel continued throughout June 12, and the group claimed responsibility for them to the pro-Iranian media outlet Al-Mayadeen. Iranian media also claimed Hezbollah had targeted Israeli \"spy facilities.\" The terrorist group frequently claims it is able to carry out precision attacks targeting IDF posts and bases.\n\nOn the evening of June 12, the IDF said that it used ground-based air defenses and aircraft to intercept drones targeting Mount Hermon in the Golan. The IDF also stated that it retaliated against the Hezbollah attacks with \"a series of strikes on Hezbollah terror targets in southern Lebanon, including military structures in Yater and Markaba and terrorist infrastructure in the area of Tallouseh.\"\n\nThe Hezbollah escalation came amid relative quiet in Gaza as the IDF continues operations against Hamas and other terrorist groups. The IDF's 98 Division, which entered central Gaza on June 5 and targeted Hamas in Bureij and Deir al-Balah, recently completed operations in the area. On June 11, the IDF reported that the division killed around 100 terrorists during this period and \"destroyed dozens of terrorist infrastructure sites and launch areas situated near communities in southern Israel.\"\n\nThe operations in central Gaza also included the IDF's Kfir Infantry Brigade, the 7 Armored Brigade, and members of the Yahalom combat engineers. \"Yahalom soldiers scanned and destroyed [...] two tunnels, which were each one kilometer in length and contained rooms and weapons, and destroyed over two kilometers of the attack tunnels,\" the IDF added in a statement.\n\nThe battles in Bureij and Deir al-Balah formed part of a larger, more important raid in the area of Nuseirat in which four Israeli hostages were rescued on June 8.\n\n\"We're also committed to destroying the enemy on the other side and dismantling its underground infrastructure and infrastructure above the ground,\" Brig. Gen. Dan Goldfus, the commander of the 98 Division, said to his troops after the successful rescue. \"That's what we've been doing for the past eight months, and we'll keep on doing it, pushing forward.\"\n\nFighting continues in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where the IDF has been operating since early May. These forces also continue to dismantle rocket launch sites and tunnels used by terrorists.\n\n\"Troops eliminated a number of armed terrorist cells in close-quarters encounters in the area. IDF troops also located and destroyed structures rigged with explosives, as well as weapons, ammunition, military vests, and additional military equipment found in the area,\" the IDF said on June 11.", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FDD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hhanes@fdd.org", "name": "hhanes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri":

A veteran commander, Taleb Sami Abdullah, was killed alongside three of his underlings.\n\nAs Israelis in northern areas of the country beseech their government to end Hezbollah's eight months of military aggression, President Biden is reportedly concerned that Jerusalem is \"rushing to war\" in Lebanon, from which the terrorist organization operates.\n\nHezbollah spokesmen say the organization has launched its \"most extensive\" attack on northern Israel Thursday, boasting that the group has hit 15 military bases in the Galilee region and the Golan. According to Israeli officials, two civilians were injured but not seriously, and while there was extensive property damage, no bases were hit.\n\nHezbollah attacks on Wednesday and Thursday followed Tuesday's strike by the Israel Defense Force on the Hezbollah Nasser unit's headquarters in southern Lebanon. A veteran commander, Taleb Sami Abdullah, was killed alongside three of his underlings.\n\nWidely known as Abu Taleb, the battalion commander was the highest-ranked officer to have perished since Hezbollah started its attacks on October 8. Abu Taleb was also reportedly a close associate of Hezbollah's chief, Hassan Nasrallah, who has to date calibrated attacks to avoid all-out war. The Thursday assault, though, is seen as a significant escalation.\n\nIn two days Hezbollah launched more than 200 missiles, anti-tank rockets, and explosive drones that triggered alert sirens as far south as Tiberias, the largest city on the Sea of Galilee. Farther north, projectiles coupled with early summer heat ignited flames, and firefighters struggled to douse burning fields. Livestock died, including at chicken farms that supply a sizable share of the country's eggs.\n\nMore than 80,000 citizens have been evacuated from northern Israel since October. Some of those who remain feel neglected. \"The government has abandoned us,\" a resident of the community of Dalton, Shirel Kamissa, told Channel 13 News on Thursday.\n\nAs the IDF fights in Gaza, the government is reluctant to open a second front in the north. A full-fledged war with Hezbollah, Iran's best-armed proxy, would entail major casualties all over Israel and have dire economic consequences.\n\n\"If there is a diplomatic solution, that is better\" than an all-out war, a Knesset member who just left Prime Minister Netanyahu's war cabinet, Benny Gantz, told Channel 12 news. As Washington and Paris work hard to reach a diplomatic solution, however, Israelis wonder if there is one to be reached.\n\n\"I don't know what the government will do,\" the founder of a northern Israel-based research institute, Alma, Sarit Zehavi, tells the Sun. \"Everything here is on fire, people's homes are gone, and all Biden wants is a cease-fire, regardless if it will give us security.\"\n\nWashington is \"concerned about Israel rushing into a war with Hezbollah -- or getting dragged into one -- without a clear strategy or consideration of the full implications of a wider conflict,\" an unidentified administration official told Axios Wednesday.\n\nThe concern, reportedly, is that if an ever-escalating tit-for-tat evolves into an all-out war in Lebanon, Iran would join forces with Hezbollah and engulf the entire region in conflict. A White House Mideast adviser, Amos Hochstein, has been shuttling in the region for months in an attempt to prevent such a scenario through diplomatic means.\n\nBriefing reporters on Thursday, an administration official traveling with Mr. Biden to Italy said that since October Washington has been talking to \"Israel and Lebanon\" -- in reality, Hezbollah -- \"to keep this from developing into a full-out war that could have implications\" elsewhere in the region.\n\nYet, an increasing number of Israelis have grown leery of the Biden administration's diplomacy. Israel quietly made significant concessions to Hamas in the hope of freeing hostages held in Gaza. Mr. Biden then detailed a version of Jerusalem's plan in a White House speech that later evolved into a United Nations Security Council resolution. After two weeks of silence, Hamas gave its answer on Wednesday.\n\nUnfortunately, it was \"not the yes that we were looking for,\" Secretary Blinken told NBC Thursday. The only hindrance to a deal, he added, is Hamas's Gaza commander, Yehya Sinwar. Gazans are \"suffering every day,\" the secretary said, \"so if he has their interests at heart, he will come to a conclusion to bring this to a conclusion.\"\n\nMr. Blinken vowed to continue pushing the deal and made no deadline for Hamas to reply, likely leading Sinwar to conclude that time is on his side. \"W/great respect to US diplomats, appealing to #Sinwar's humanitarian instincts will have no impact,\" a veteran Mideast observer, the Washington Institute's Robert Satloff, writes on X.\n\n\"Far better to make clear that failure to endorse ceasefire, without further haggling, will result in accelerated delivery of U.S. weapons to #Israel, offer for U.S. Corps of Engineers to join in technical efforts to cut all underground connections between #Gaza and #Sinai and arrest/extradition of #Hamas external leaders to stand trial in Israel,\" Mr. Satloff writes.\n\nIsraelis who say that diplomacy, rather than the military, will end the crisis in the north are increasingly discouraged by Washington's failure to use American leverage in its diplomatic efforts to end the Gaza war.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Like, life is going on elsewhere, but your own time has stopped.\"\n\nBut the fighting between Hezbollah, which several countries including the US and Germany have classified as a terrorist organization, and Israel's armed forces has not ended. In fact, over the past few weeks, it seems to have ramped up.\n\nDaher survived the 2006 war in southern Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, but said that felt like nothing compared to the current exchange of blows.\n\nIn early June, human rights groups reported that Israel fired white phosphorous munitions over Lebanese towns, which is in violation of international humanitarian law. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has fired more than 160 rockets into Israel, in retaliation for Israel's assassination of two of their commanders.\n\nEver since the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people, the situation at the Israel-Lebanon border has been increasingly tense.\n\nThe EU, the US, Germany and others classify Hamas, which governs Gaza, as a terrorist group. Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese group that plays a dominant part in Lebanese political and social life, considers Hamas an ally, while explicitly opposing Israel.\n\nAfter two inconclusive wars in 1996 and 2006, Israeli forces and Hezbollah have preferred tit-for-tat attacks in each others' territories -- without huge casualty counts.\n\nHowever, since October 7, these sorts of attacks have expanded from both sides, both in size and scope.\n\nThis has raised concerns that unrest at the border will turn into a full-scale war. Several hardliner Israeli politicians have already publicly stated that Israel should attack Hezbollah now, given the tensions at the border. A recent popular survey indicated that a majority of Israeli citizens, more than 60%, currently agree with this position.\n\n\"The October 7 attacks dramatically increased Israeli insecurity,\" a March briefing by the Washington-based think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explained. \"If Hamas, less well-armed and trained than Hezbollah, can brutally kill over 1,100 Israelis, what might the more formidable Hezbollah do?\"\n\nIt is unclear whether a wider war will break out. Current international diplomatic efforts are dedicated to preventing this, and most experts argue it would be strategically unwise for Israel to open another front as it continues its military operations in Gaza.\n\nThey also point out that Hezbollah is a far better armed and more powerful adversary than Hamas in Gaza.\n\nAs for Lebanon, the country has been mired in economic and political crises for years now. Even if the population sympathizes with Palestinians, more than 37,000 of whom have been killed in Gaza in the past eight months, Lebanese locals -- struggling with inflation, unemployment and political uncertainty -- are unlikely to support Hezbollah dragging them towards war.\n\nLebanese authorities say there have been more than 375 fatalities in Lebanon since October 2023, including 88 civilians, due to Israeli strikes. Israel's military has counted 18 soldiers and 10 civilians killed by Hezbollah fire.\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of civilians -- around 100,000 Lebanese and more than 60,000 Israeli -- living on both sides of the border have been displaced by fighting.\n\nLocals told DW that those who left southern Lebanon were reluctant to return unless they absolutely had to. Some went back to check on property whenever things seemed calmer, or to attend a funeral, for example. But most shops and supermarkets in the area were closed, and it was hard to find supplies, they said.\n\nWhen Daher first fled to Beirut after border skirmishes began in late 2023, the trained nurse was unemployed. So, she said she decided to go back to work at a hospital in southeastern Bint Jbeil, also near Lebanon's border with Israel. Now, she stays there for three days, works her shifts, then returns to Beirut, where she and her mother are staying with relatives.\n\nAt one point, Daher said she so desperately wanted to return to Mais al-Jabal that she and her 60-year-old mother, who used to make a living growing olives and tobacco in the border village, journeyed back. But it was a nightmare, Daher told DW. With missiles fired at all hours of the night, all they could do was hide in the corridor until morning.\n\n\"I thought we were going to die together,\" recounted Daher, whose husband works in Kuwait. As soon as the sun came up, the pair returned to Beirut. Now Daher only comes back to work, even though she is well aware of how dangerous it is. In late May, an Israeli strike nearly hit the hospital where she works.\n\n\"They haven't just taken my time,\" Daher said of the Israeli military. \"They've stolen my ambitions and my peace. I have become an angry, anxious woman who waits for aid. Before this, I was an independent woman.\"\n\nA handful of people in southern Lebanon have refused to leave, despite the ongoing fighting and growing threat of war. One of them is Issam Alawieh, 44 and a father of seven. He has stayed in his home in the border village of Maroun el-Ras along with his wife and two of his sons. The family has survived three Israeli air strikes so far.\n\n\"You hear only the crash. It's like a volcano coming from beneath you,\" said Alawieh, who lost his hearing for a week after one attack.\n\nAlawieh has continued working in a bakery in nearby Bint Jbeil.\n\n\"Even though the income is not good and sales have decreased [by] 95%, I have to continue to provide food for my children,\" he told DW.\n\nLiving in such dangerous conditions was better than being displaced and forced to accept aid elsewhere, Alawieh argued. Neighbors who fled town called him crazy, he said, but he believes his family has adapted -- the children were getting used to the sound of bombing.\n\n\"If I go and leave everything here, I will be humiliated, and I don't want that,\" he explained.\n\nBut there's more to it than that, he added: This is his home.\n\n\"I cannot live away from south Lebanon. This land is like my mother,\" he argued. \"I cannot survive without her, and we will win as long as we are steadfast in our land.\"", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Mayors in northern Israel called for \"decisive\" action against Hezbollah amid its increasing attacks.

At a time when the U.S. is trying to impose a ceasefire in Gaza, Hamas has less incentive to agree now that its Hezbollah ally is trying to pull Israel into a new war in Lebanon. The failure of the international community to disarm Hezbollah -- as demanded by UN Security Council Resolution 1701, passed after the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict -- has never been more apparent.\" \u00ad -- Mark Dubowitz, FDD CEO\n\n\"Israel is facing a growing multi-front challenge as Hezbollah escalates attacks on northern Israel and the IDF fights terror in Gaza. Hezbollah's decision to increase the range of its attacks and the number of cities in Israel that it is targeting may force Israel to respond strongly to the ongoing attacks.\" -- Seth J. Frantzman, FDD Adjunct Fellow\n\nAs the northern front heated up, the IDF eliminated \"dozens of gunmen\" in a raid on the Zaytun and Sabra neighborhoods in Gaza on June 13. The raids targeted areas near the IDF-controlled Netzarim corridor that runs across the Gaza strip south of Gaza City. The IDF also dismantled fifty terrorist sites during the raid. Among the sites uncovered was an 800-meter tunnel discovered in the area of Juhor ad-Dik, which abuts the corridor. The thirty-meter deep tunnel was demolished by Israeli combat engineers.\n\n\"Hezbollah Rockets Pound Israel Following Killing of Senior Terror Commander,\" FDD Flash Brief\n\n\"19,000 Rockets Launched at Israel Since Hamas's October 7 Atrocities,\" FDD Flash Brief", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FDD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "krystal_bermudez@fdd.org", "name": "Krystal Bermudez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrapnel_shell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shrapnel shell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Defense_of_Democracies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foundation for Defense of Democracies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabra (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juhor_ad-Dik", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juhor ad-Dik"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Juhor ad-Dik"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Rockets", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.fdd.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2156761219-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9645854", "eventUri": "eng-9645854", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 62, "textEnd": 69, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2266, "textEnd": 2275}], "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

As fighting between Hezbollah and the Israeli military ramps up, Lebanese locals are dealing with difficult choices.\n\nWhen the most recent round of fighting between Israel and the Lebanon-based militant group, Hezbollah, began, Lebanese woman Malak Daher hoped it would only last a few days.\n\n\"It's so hard to be so far from your life,\" said the 30-year-old, who was displaced from the southern town of Mais al-Jabal, located almost directly at the Lebanese-Israeli border where fighting is centered. \"You feel like your life is on hold. Like, life is going on elsewhere, but your own time has stopped.\"\n\nBut the fighting between Hezbollah, which several countries including the US and Germany have classified as a terrorist organization, and Israel's armed forces has not ended. In fact, over the past few weeks, it seems to have ramped up.\n\nDaher survived the 2006 war in southern Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, but said that felt like nothing compared to the current exchange of blows.\n\nIn early June, human rights groups reported that Israel fired white phosphorous munitions over Lebanese towns, which is in violation of international humanitarian law. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has fired more than 160 rockets into Israel, in retaliation for Israel's assassination of two of their commanders.\n\nEver since the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people, the situation at the Israel-Lebanon border has been increasingly tense.\n\nThe EU, the US, Germany and others classify Hamas, which governs Gaza, as a terrorist group. Hezbollah, a powerful Lebanese group that plays a dominant part in Lebanese political and social life, considers Hamas an ally, while explicitly opposing Israel.\n\nAfter two inconclusive wars in 1996 and 2006, Israeli forces and Hezbollah have preferred tit-for-tat attacks in each others' territories -- without huge casualty counts.\n\nHowever, since October 7, these sorts of attacks have expanded from both sides, both in size and scope.\n\nThis has raised concerns that unrest at the border will turn into a full-scale war. Several hardliner Israeli politicians have already publicly stated that Israel should attack Hezbollah now, given the tensions at the border. A recent popular survey indicated that a majority of Israeli citizens, more than 60%, currently agree with this position.\n\n\"The October 7 attacks dramatically increased Israeli insecurity,\" a March briefing by the Washington-based think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explained. \"If Hamas, less well-armed and trained than Hezbollah, can brutally kill over 1,100 Israelis, what might the more formidable Hezbollah do?\"\n\nIt is unclear whether a wider war will break out. Current international diplomatic efforts are dedicated to preventing this, and most experts argue it would be strategically unwise for Israel to open another front as it continues its military operations in Gaza.\n\nThey also point out that Hezbollah is a far better armed and more powerful adversary than Hamas in Gaza.\n\nAs for Lebanon, the country has been mired in economic and political crises for years now. Even if the population sympathizes with Palestinians, more than 37,000 of whom have been killed in Gaza in the past eight months, Lebanese locals -- struggling with inflation, unemployment and political uncertainty -- are unlikely to support Hezbollah dragging them towards war.\n\nLebanese authorities say there have been more than 375 fatalities in Lebanon since October 2023, including 88 civilians, due to Israeli strikes. Israel's military has counted 18 soldiers and 10 civilians killed by Hezbollah fire.\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of civilians -- around 100,000 Lebanese and more than 60,000 Israeli -- living on both sides of the border have been displaced by fighting.\n\nLocals told DW that those who left southern Lebanon were reluctant to return unless they absolutely had to. Some went back to check on property whenever things seemed calmer, or to attend a funeral, for example. But most shops and supermarkets in the area were closed, and it was hard to find supplies, they said.\n\nWhen Daher first fled to Beirut after border skirmishes began in late 2023, the trained nurse was unemployed. So, she said she decided to go back to work at a hospital in southeastern Bint Jbeil, also near Lebanon's border with Israel. Now, she stays there for three days, works her shifts, then returns to Beirut, where she and her mother are staying with relatives.\n\nAt one point, Daher said she so desperately wanted to return to Mais al-Jabal that she and her 60-year-old mother, who used to make a living growing olives and tobacco in the border village, journeyed back. But it was a nightmare, Daher told DW. With missiles fired at all hours of the night, all they could do was hide in the corridor until morning.\n\n\"I thought we were going to die together,\" recounted Daher, whose husband works in Kuwait. As soon as the sun came up, the pair returned to Beirut. Now Daher only comes back to work, even though she is well aware of how dangerous it is. In late May, an Israeli strike nearly hit the hospital where she works.\n\n\"They haven't just taken my time,\" Daher said of the Israeli military. \"They've stolen my ambitions and my peace. I have become an angry, anxious woman who waits for aid. Before this, I was an independent woman.\"\n\nA handful of people in southern Lebanon have refused to leave, despite the ongoing fighting and growing threat of war. One of them is Issam Alawieh, 44 and a father of seven. He has stayed in his home in the border village of Maroun el-Ras along with his wife and two of his sons. The family has survived three Israeli air strikes so far.\n\n\"You hear only the crash. It's like a volcano coming from beneath you,\" said Alawieh, who lost his hearing for a week after one attack.\n\nAlawieh has continued working in a bakery in nearby Bint Jbeil.\n\n\"Even though the income is not good and sales have decreased [by] 95%, I have to continue to provide food for my children,\" he told DW.\n\nLiving in such dangerous conditions was better than being displaced and forced to accept aid elsewhere, Alawieh argued. Neighbors who fled town called him crazy, he said, but he believes his family has adapted -- the children were getting used to the sound of bombing.\n\n\"If I go and leave everything here, I will be humiliated, and I don't want that,\" he explained.\n\nBut there's more to it than that, he added: This is his home.\n\n\"I cannot live away from south Lebanon. This land is like my mother,\" he argued. \"I cannot survive without her, and we will win as long as we are steadfast in our land.\"", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The initial wave of attacks followed an Israeli airstrike that killed a Hezbollah senior commander. The group's continued escalation has raised eyebrows in Israel and Iran, which backs Hezbollah.\n\nThe growing clashes have also led to US concerns about another possible war, and both Israel's Ynet media and the pro-Iranian AL-Mayadeen reported on worries about an escalation. Israeli mayors and regional officials in northern Israel expressed concerns over the continued attacks and the lack of a robust response. Iran's acting foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, warned Israel against attacking Lebanon while on a visit to Iraq on June 13.\n\nThe beginning of the June 13 attacks was marked by sirens sounding in the community of Shtula, which sits directly on the Lebanese border, followed by alarms in the city of Kiryat Shmona and nine other communities in the northern Huleh Valley. Israel evacuated these areas in October 2023, when Hezbollah initially began its attacks, and Israel was concerned the terrorist group would launch a large-scale incursion similar to Hamas's attack on October 7.\n\nIDF systems that detect incoming threats and trigger sirens also responded to a number of false identifications on June 13, including several suspected drone infiltrations. For instance, the IDF stated that \"the sirens that sounded at 12:26 and 13:19 regarding rocket and missile fire and a hostile aircraft infiltration in the Western Galilee area, it was determined to be a false identification.\"\n\nMany of the identified incidents were real, however. At 3 pm, 40 rockets targeted the upper Galilee and Golan Heights. \"Numerous launches were successfully intercepted by the IDF Aerial Defense Array. A number of hits that ignited fires in the area were identified,\" the IDF said.\n\nSignificant drone attacks were also detected, and the IDF said it intercepted seven of the unmanned aircraft. The drone incursions continued into the evening.\n\nIn addition, Hezbollah targeted the community of Manara, which sits on a ridgeline over the Huleh valley on the Lebanese border. A guided anti-tank missile moderately wounded one IDF soldier and lightly injured a second. \"The injured soldiers were evacuated to a hospital to receive medical treatment,\" according to an IDF statement.\n\nIsraeli aircraft retaliated for the attacks, striking several areas in Jarmac and Deir Seryan in southern Lebanon that the IDF characterized as housing military structures. In another strike overnight between June 12 and June 13, Israeli warplanes hit Ayta ash Shab, an area frequently targeted in retaliation.\n\nAmid this escalation with Hezbollah, the IDF continues to train forces for a possible war in the north. Combat teams from the 4 Armored Reserve Brigade, known as the Kiryati, trained with elements of the 226 Paratrooper Reserve Brigade over the first two weeks of June. The 4 Armored had fought in Gaza in December and January after its reservists were called up in October following Hamas's attack. The 226 Brigade has been conducting defensive operations along the northern border.\n\n\"The exercise simulated a combat scenario at varying ranges while emphasizing the capabilities of movement in complex terrain, advancement along mountainous routes, the activation of multi-faceted fire, and combat in various terrain,\" the IDF said.\n\nThe drills are part of a larger series of exercises that reservists with the IDF's 146 Division have conducted since December. The 146 is one of several divisions Israel has deployed in the north. The 36 Division and two territorial divisions, the 91 and the 210, are also responsible for securing the country's northern and Golan borders.\n\nReporting from Israel, Seth J.

"body": "The Israeli military has used a medieval-style trebuchet to lob incendiaries across the northern border into Lebanon.\n\nA video that first emerged on social media on Thursday appeared to show Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldiers loading the wooden siege engine with flaming projectiles and launching them into Lebanese plantations.\n\nThe military responded that the use of the contraption was \"a local initiative and not a tool that is widely used\", reported Israeli state broadcaster KAN News.\n\nThe ancient artillery weapon was used during the Middle Ages in sieges of castles and other fortified locations.\n\nIn this case, the device may have been used to clear dense vegetation in the border area which could help the army prevent terrorists infiltrating Israel, suggested Emanuel Fabian, the Times of Israel military correspondent, who initially posted the video.\n\nThe footage comes at a time of heightened hostilities between the IDF and the Hezbollah terrorist group, which has been intensifying its barrage of rockets, anti-tank missiles and explosive drones into northern Israel in support of Hamas throughout the Gaza war.\n\nOn Tuesday, the IDF killed Sami Taleb Abdullah, the most senior Hezbollah commander to die since the October 7 attacks.\n\nThe airstrike prompted the Lebanon-based group to launch a volley of some 250 rockets into the north of Israel, reaching as far south as the area of Tiberias.\n\nSome 60,000 Israelis and 100,000 Lebanese residents are believed to have been displaced from both sides of the border.\n\nPublic outcry over dramatic bushfires sparked by incoming missiles in recent weeks spurred Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, last week to threaten an \"extremely powerful\" response and \"strong action\" to restore security to the north.\n\nThe US military on Wednesday urged a de-escalation in rising tensions between Israel and Lebanon. \"We don't want to see a wider regional conflict and we do want to see a de-escalation of tensions in the region,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Footage shows Israel using a literal trebuchet to launch fireballs across the border at farms, setting serious fires.\n\nTrebuchets are a rotating arm variety of catapult, and were commonly used in the Middle Ages as a weapon for siege warfare. It isn't clear why Israel's military has such weapons in this day and age, as they fell out of favor in the 15 century.\n\nSupposedly, the fireballs are being used to clear out the dense vegetation from the border region, as Israeli officials suggest that such areas serve as potential hiding areas for militants, which complicates defense in the area.\n\nIn practice, both sides increasingly use fire as a weapon of war. Hezbollah's rocket fire often hits open brushy areas in northern Israel, setting fires that Israeli fire services struggle to contain. Widespread destruction of farmland has resulted from Israel's general attack on southern Lebanon and has greatly damaged the main economic infrastructure of the region.\n\nHezbollah fired an estimated 40 rockets against northern Israel on Thursday. The group said nine different military sites were targeted. Several resulting fires were reported as well as two Israeli wounded.\n\nIsraeli fighters carried out an attack today on the area of Deir Seryan in southern Lebanon, attacking what was described as \"infrastructure.\" Israel also claimed to have intercepted three drones launched from the Lebanese south.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trebuchet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catapult", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catapult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_(Israel)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern District (Israel)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9645854", "eventUri": "eng-9645854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Let me reformulate, what can an elected Lebanese president achieve when the country is controlled by Hezbollah? And for that matter, what can a prime minister, a member of parliament or any public official do? Lebanon is stuck between the south being burned to the ground and instability in Syria from the north, with a sprinkle of a political vacuum. Surprisingly or not, the last of these is the least of Lebanon's problems, as life can go on without the politicians.\n\nAt least for now, no sovereign voice is covering up or tacitly endorsing Hezbollah's policies in front of the Lebanese or the international community. So I ask, why give Hezbollah this endorsement and firewall protection once again? What will the Lebanese gain from it?\n\nThis is why, on the current debate in Lebanon, I agree with Samir Geagea's stance regarding the election of a president, which states that there is no need for consultations. There is a parliament, let it play its role, quorum after quorum, until a president is elected. At least, in this manner, we will see who the ruling force is and who the opposition is. Any other solution gives a full political guarantee to Hezbollah to do whatever pleases the militia and its patrons in Tehran, while blaming any ills on the Lebanese state. This is also why, today, Walid Jumblatt should not take a centrist, weakened position but join forces in an opposition front and not be part of another cover-up of Hezbollah's role and status.\n\nConsensus and the \"no winner, no loser\" formula have brought devastating results in the country. Consensus is what permitted the cover-up of the Lebanese banking system's Ponzi scheme or, as the Egyptian saying goes, \"Shayyelni w' ashayyelak,\" which translates to \"you load (stuff) on me, I load (stuff) on you,\" or \"you scratch my back and I scratch yours.\" Today, for non-Arabic speakers, this saying is often used to denote corruption and backroom deals. It is the definition of the Lebanese political scene. Moreover, the formula has brought a unique winner and that is Hezbollah. The other communities have lost and these \"consultations\" are nothing but a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. Opposition to Hezbollah -- no matter how weak, even if it cannot do anything, even if it is nothing but a whisper -- is a necessity. Western powers should put more effort into letting an opposition live, rather than pushing for a president that will yield to Hezbollah's wishes. Even if not much can be done, the lines between the opposition and the ruling party cannot stay blurred any longer. This is the least that can be done. Lebanon needs a real opposition force. Even if it cannot stop Hezbollah from moving forward, it can voice its disagreement.\n\nFinally, a real opposition would also offer a much-needed message to France and the US that, through their current initiatives and their choice of support packages, they bear responsibility for pushing solutions that give Hezbollah even more power and control. This comes with risks if pushed too far, yet this is a sad situation for any free voice in Lebanon.\n\nLebanon needs consultations, but not between members of parliament to choose a president of consensus. It needs consultations with the people of the country. Real town hall meetings, in which alternatives to the current political system are discussed. Lawyers, business owners, workers and mothers need to be included and this should be a roadmap for a new Lebanon. One might, rightly, ask what is the point when Hezbollah controls everything and silences any opposition? I believe in setting a goal or planning for a better future even in the worst of times. We cannot and should not give in to total despair and abandonment.\n\nWe have indeed noticed a larger part of the population starting to recognize that Hezbollah is only a symptom and the real issue is the national pact and constitution that keeps the country in a vicious circle. One short decade, the 1960s, made Lebanon shine economically, culturally and financially, but this is no longer enough to keep this system going. Even with its nostalgia. And let us be honest, this great period was a time when, against all other political ideologies, the promotion of capitalism and personal freedom made the Lebanese successful. Unfortunately, the structural base was flawed and so it was short-lived. Since then, under the mirage of libertarianism, the real force in Lebanon has been led by leftist militantism mixed with religion and Hezbollah is the final boss in this game. I am surprised that today, even on the constitution, progressive forces do not request a change and have accepted a constitution set up by what they usually call \"colonizing and invading powers.\" In all fairness, their proposed solution is just as dangerous and serves Hezbollah, as they see the sectarian divide being replaced with a centralized power that rips every community of its identity and forces them into uniform thoughts and beliefs.\n\nLebanon needs a united opposition bloc that does not stay silent as a militia takes over the decisions of peace and war. Opposition forces cannot hit each other or be accomplices in these actions or be the scapegoats. Someone needs to ask, in parliament, for an evaluation of Hezbollah's actions. What has Hezbollah done since Israel unilaterally withdrew from Lebanon? What territories has it protected or gained? Moreover, what unnecessary destruction has it brought upon the country?\n\nIf we look at the south today, we see Hezbollah serving its transnational ideology and ensuring destruction in Lebanon. The southerners, across religious groups, are caught between a rock and a hard place and are left with no hope. A real opposition would speak up for them and the entire country.", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Frontier Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quorum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samir_Geagea", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samir Geagea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_Jumblatt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walid Jumblatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ponzi scheme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sectarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Libertarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/afp_20230119_337e2fh_v1_highres_lebanonpoliticsgovernment_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9645854", "eventUri": "eng-9645854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Let me reformulate, what can an elected Lebanese president achieve when the country is controlled by Hezbollah? And for that matter, what can a prime minister, a member of parliament or any public official do? Lebanon is stuck between the south being burned to the ground and instability in Syria from the north, with a sprinkle of a political vacuum. Surprisingly or not, the last of these is the least of Lebanon's problems, as life can go on without the politicians. At least for now, no sovereign voice is covering up or tacitly endorsing Hezbollah's policies in front of the Lebanese or the international community. So I ask, why give Hezbollah this endorsement and firewall protection once again? What will the Lebanese gain from it?\n\nThis is why, on the current debate in Lebanon, I agree with Samir Geagea's stance regarding the election of a president, which states that there is no need for consultations. There is a parliament, let it play its role, quorum after quorum, until a president is elected. At least, in this manner, we will see who the ruling force is and who the opposition is. Any other solution gives a full political guarantee to Hezbollah to do whatever pleases the militia and its patrons in Tehran, while blaming any ills on the Lebanese state. This is also why, today, Walid Jumblatt should not take a centrist, weakened position but join forces in an opposition front and not be part of another cover-up of Hezbollah's role and status.\n\nConsensus and the \"no winner, no loser\" formula have brought devastating results in the country. Consensus is what permitted the cover-up of the Lebanese banking system's Ponzi scheme or, as the Egyptian saying goes, \"Shayyelni w' ashayyelak,\" which translates to \"you load (stuff) on me, I load (stuff) on you,\" or \"you scratch my back and I scratch yours.\" Today, for non-Arabic speakers, this saying is often used to denote corruption and backroom deals. It is the definition of the Lebanese political scene. Moreover, the formula has brought a unique winner and that is Hezbollah. The other communities have lost and these \"consultations\" are nothing but a Band-Aid on a bullet wound.\n\nEven if not much can be done, the lines between the opposition and the ruling party cannot stay blurred any longer\n\nKhaled Abou Zahr\n\nOpposition to Hezbollah -- no matter how weak, even if it cannot do anything, even if it is nothing but a whisper -- is a necessity. Western powers should put more effort into letting an opposition live, rather than pushing for a president that will yield to Hezbollah's wishes. Even if not much can be done, the lines between the opposition and the ruling party cannot stay blurred any longer. This is the least that can be done. Lebanon needs a real opposition force. Even if it cannot stop Hezbollah from moving forward, it can voice its disagreement.\n\nFinally, a real opposition would also offer a much-needed message to France and the US that, through their current initiatives and their choice of support packages, they bear responsibility for pushing solutions that give Hezbollah even more power and control. This comes with risks if pushed too far, yet this is a sad situation for any free voice in Lebanon.\n\nLebanon needs consultations, but not between members of parliament to choose a president of consensus. It needs consultations with the people of the country. Real town hall meetings, in which alternatives to the current political system are discussed. Lawyers, business owners, workers and mothers need to be included and this should be a roadmap for a new Lebanon. One might, rightly, ask what is the point when Hezbollah controls everything and silences any opposition? I believe in setting a goal or planning for a better future even in the worst of times. We cannot and should not give in to total despair and abandonment.\n\nWe have indeed noticed a larger part of the population starting to recognize that Hezbollah is only a symptom and the real issue is the national pact and constitution that keeps the country in a vicious circle. One short decade, the 1960s, made Lebanon shine economically, culturally and financially, but this is no longer enough to keep this system going. Even with its nostalgia. And let us be honest, this great period was a time when, against all other political ideologies, the promotion of capitalism and personal freedom made the Lebanese successful.\n\nLebanon needs a united opposition bloc that does not stay silent as a militia takes over the decisions of peace and war\n\nKhaled Abou Zahr\n\nUnfortunately, the structural base was flawed and so it was short-lived. Since then, under the mirage of libertarianism, the real force in Lebanon has been led by leftist militantism mixed with religion and Hezbollah is the final boss in this game. I am surprised that today, even on the constitution, progressive forces do not request a change and have accepted a constitution set up by what they usually call \"colonizing and invading powers.\" In all fairness, their proposed solution is just as dangerous and serves Hezbollah, as they see the sectarian divide being replaced with a centralized power that rips every community of its identity and forces them into uniform thoughts and beliefs.\n\nLebanon needs a united opposition bloc that does not stay silent as a militia takes over the decisions of peace and war. Opposition forces cannot hit each other or be accomplices in these actions or be the scapegoats. Someone needs to ask, in parliament, for an evaluation of Hezbollah's actions. What has Hezbollah done since Israel unilaterally withdrew from Lebanon? What territories has it protected or gained? Moreover, what unnecessary destruction has it brought upon the country?\n\nIf we look at the south today, we see Hezbollah serving its transnational ideology and ensuring destruction in Lebanon. The southerners, across religious groups, are caught between a rock and a hard place and are left with no hope. A real opposition would speak up for them and the entire country.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quorum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samir_Geagea", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samir Geagea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_Jumblatt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walid Jumblatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ponzi scheme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sectarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Libertarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/authors/3051736-khaledabouzahr2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9645854", "eventUri": "eng-9645854", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

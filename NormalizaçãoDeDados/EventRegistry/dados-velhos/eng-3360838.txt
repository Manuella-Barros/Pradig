The Defenders premieres Aug. 18 and is stuffed to the gills with characters from Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, from Misty Knight to Foggy Nelson to Jeri Hogarth. One fan favorite Daredevil anti-hero is a likely suspect to make a surprise appearance too: Frank Castle, played by Jon Bernthal. How many episodes of The Defenders is the Punisher in, though?\n\nWell, there's actually no official news about Frank appearing in The Defenders... yet. Though neither Marvel, Netflix, nor Bernthal have confirmed if or when he may show up, there are definitely a lot of clues that suggest that fans will be catching a glimpse of the Punisher in this summer's highly-anticipated superhero team-up, ahead of his own solo spin-off series premiere.\n\nFirst, there's the fact that Bernthal attended The Defenders panel at San Diego Comic-Con. Ostensibly, he was there to promote The Punisher -- he introduced the first preview clip of the show to the lucky audience members -- but his appearance might mean something more. Then, there's also the fact that he makes a cameo appearance at the end of the Stan Lee-narrated trailer for The Defenders. Now, according to Entertainment Weekly, the clip of Bernthal was actually from footage from The Punisher... but it still seems like a hint, right? There's also the very telling fact, that when EW asked him point blank about his appearance in The Defenders, Bernthal was unable to provide a direct answer.\n\nSo a Punisher appearance in The Defenders is looking very likely at this point. The evidence just keeps on stacking up. Keep your eyes peeled during the eight episodes of the new series for a glimpse of the character, no matter what hand-waving Marvel may be doing to convince you that he's sitting this one out.\n\nThat said, don't get your hopes up for the Punisher joining the team as an actual Defender anytime soon. After hedging about the potential of a second season of The Defenders, Marvel head of television Jeph Loeb joked to Collider that they'd be \"like peanut butter and asparagus.\" He also explained, \"One of the things that's unique about The Punisher -- and Jon Bernthal's performance -- is that that character can stand alone. Even in the comic books, Frank Castle's Punisher is a character that does well by himself. I think that when you start mixing it in, it feels a little off.\"\n\nStill, whether or not Frank Castle will appear in (or eventually join) The Defenders, it's good to know that he's got his very own Netflix series in the pipeline. There's no official release date for it yet, but word is fans will get it before the year is out. Deborah Ann Woll is co-starring, and judging by the complex relationship Frank and Karen Page built in Daredevil Season 2, they're going to be a lot of fun to watch together.\n\nBetween a possible Defenders cameo and the impending arrival of his own series, Bernthal's Punisher is one character Marvel seems to know fans can't get enough of.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building_Types", "wgt": 100, "id": 369, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building Types"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "304575", "label": {"eng": "Stan Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304816", "label": {"eng": "Character (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304945", "label": {"eng": "Antihero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "313045", "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314207", "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319777", "label": {"eng": "Peanut butter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "342245", "label": {"eng": "Punisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_crossover", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "343622", "label": {"eng": "Fictional crossover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "355935", "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeph_Loeb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "408147", "label": {"eng": "Jeph Loeb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bernthal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "468287", "label": {"eng": "Jon Bernthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "547406", "label": {"eng": "Misty Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foggy_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "641254", "label": {"eng": "Foggy Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Ann_Woll", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "661053", "label": {"eng": "Deborah Ann Woll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeryn_Hogarth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1325418", "label": {"eng": "Jeryn Hogarth"}}]}

Marvel's Netflix heroes are about to crossover for the first time, with Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist teaming-up to become The Defenders against Sigourney Weaver and The Hand. Have those trailers gotten you excited? Well, I was very lucky enough to see the first four episodes of the show in advance, and here are four quick takeaways before the show officially launches tomorrow.\n\nAfter a string of great shows, Iron Fist really did stink up the Netflix joint. It wasn't as bad as many people claimed it was, but it was a step down from Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and the first two seasons of Daredevil. Colleen Wing was awesome, but Finn Jones' Danny Rand/Iron Fist came off as a whining manbaby who needed to grow up. We all kept waiting for that vital bit of character development, but it never arrived. When the second season was announced at San Diego Comic Con with a new showrunner, there was a feeling that we could be heading in a much better direction for the character. Maybe that's all we needed? Someone else steering the ship? I'm sad to say he is still an issue within The Defenders.\n\nPerhaps it's Finn Jones. Perhaps it's making him the snarky comedic relief. Maybe it's the dialogue they give him. Maybe it's the direction. Whatever it is, Danny Rand does not gel into the show as well as Charlie Cox, Mike Colter and Krysten Ritter do. He is given some awful dialogue to work with, but his delivery isn't much better. What is interesting, however, is that Jessica Jones is not a fan of Danny Rand's personality, and Luke Cage has a monologue that highlights many fan's issues with the casting of Jones and the characterisation of Iron Fist. So perhaps the shows are becoming aware of the issue and are addressing it head on?\n\nBut hey, Colleen Wing is still awesome. So there's still that hope for a Daughters of the Dragon spin-off...\n\nThere's romantic tension between Jessica Jones and Luke Cage\n\nA rather steamy part of Jessica Jones was the relationship between the boozy hero and Luke Cage, which wasn't really highlighted in his own series to focus on a relationship with Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson). That relationship is very much the front-and-centre part of Cage's introduction into The Defenders (which skips over all of his time in prison), but the first interaction between him and Jones certainly has sparks. The two are so good together on screen that - even without dialogue - they show there is still some romance between them. Those hoping for a comics-accurate relationship may still get it at some point.\n\nWhen we're introduced to Matt Murdock in The Defenders, we're seeing a very different Daredevil to the end of season two. He's hung up the cowl to focus on being a pro bono lawyer, something he excels at. He hasn't spoken with Foggy or Karen in some time, which leads to some wonderful scenes between all three characters across a couple of episodes (there's also a nice connection between Foggy and Luke Cage in episode one). But the loss of Elektra has really cut Matt up. He has become very protective of his secret identity - hence wearing the scarf in those trailer shots - and often warns the rest of the potential Defenders that getting into this line of work and dealing with The Hand can hurt people's lives.\n\nAs a side not based on the first four episodes, The Defenders is doing a great job of laying down the groundwork for each character's next seasons while never taking focus away from the series at hand. Daredevil in particular - who feels like the real connecting tissue of the whole Netflix Marvel Universe - is getting a lot of character work which will pay off in spades come season three.\n\nThat hallway fight sequence? Hopefully there's another...\n\nA large part of Netflix's Marvel Universe is the hallway fight scene. Each season has had its own version - and The Defenders is no different. But one would hope there's more than just this one, because quite frankly it's a bit of a let down. It doesn't show off each character's uniqueness, instead cutting away to a different one-on-one encounter, which seems like a wasted opportunity. It was a great chance to see these four disparate souls come together for the first time, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. It's still good, but certainly not on par with Daredevil season one, Luke Cage or Jessica Jones. However this is within the first four episodes, so there is a chance we'll get a bigger - and better - hallway fight at some point.\n\n\"Marvel's The Defenders\" follows Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist. A quartet of singular heroes with one common goal - to save New York City. This is the story of four solitary figures, burdened with their own personal challenges, who realize they just might be stronger when teamed together.\n\nThe Defenders will hit Netflix on August 18th 2017, with Charlie Cox (Daredevil), Krysten Ritter (Jessica Jones), Mike Colter (Luke Cage), Finn Jones (Iron Fist), Deborah Ann Woll (Karen Page), Simone Missick (Misty Knight), Scott Glenn (Stick), Rosario Dawson (Claire Temple), Rachael Taylor (Trish Walker), Jessica Henwick (Colleen Wing) and Elodie Yung (Elektra) appearing alongside Sigourney Weaver as the villain, Alexandra.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311297", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314207", "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "386870", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "409370", "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Wing", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "555508", "label": {"eng": "Colleen Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughters_of_the_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "556790", "label": {"eng": "Daughters of the Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1288996", "label": {"eng": "Claire Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

Taking full advantage of the digital platform and the untethered storytelling it allows creators to offer, Marvel has been taking iconic comic book characters such as Daredevil and Iron Fist and showing them in a new light over the past few years on Netflix.\n\nThe studio's efforts have taken the heroes (and sometimes even the anti-heroes) of the Netflix corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in different directions through 13-part adventures, diving more into what makes them tick than the films. For the most part, these characters have been well thought out and the actors inhibating the roles have done a great job making them their own.\n\nOf course, The Defenders is the culmination of what Marvel has been working towards with these shows. Arriving later this month, the 8-episode series is set to unite Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist against a threat greater than anything they've faced before.\n\nWith the series only a few days away it is a great time to look at each of the Netflix heroes and see where they rank from worst to best.

But they're just starting to figure all that out in The Defenders.\n\nThe new Marvel Netflix series that teams up Matt Murdock/Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Danny Rand/really-wants-someone-to-call-him-Iron-Fist (Finn Jones) does a stellar job of weaving their standalone stories together while also bringing in a formidable villain for the four to fight.\n\nThe not-super heroes are loners by choice or circumstance, but reluctantly agree to band together to take on the city's next evil. And the new series does a good job of refreshing us on each character and what they've been up to since their standalone series without feeling like an information dump.\n\nMatt Murdock has given up his stint as the Devil of Hell's Kitchen after Elektra's death in Season 2 of Daredevil. Jessica Jones is trying to rebuild her life and her private investigations company after a mentally draining first season. Luke Cage is fresh out of another stint in jail and is still striving to keep his Harlem home a safer place. And Danny Rand is brought back to New York from Cambodia, where he was chasing The Hand with girlfriend Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick).\n\nInto their gritty New York City streets walks Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver) an elusive leader of The Hand, an underground criminal organization that made appearances in Daredevil and Iron Fist.\n\nWeaver is an electric villain, a scene-stealer in shimmery geometric ensembles spouting chilly monologues about immortality and living weapons. She brings mystery to a villain whose motives often seem wholly predictable.\n\nThe achilles heel of the Defenders quad is Jones' Iron Fist. He really wants to be called the Immortal Iron Fist, you guys, and he really wants you to know how great of a fighter he is. Danny Rand is the annoying little brother of the group, who's made more irritating by his seemingly limitless amount of money and corporate privilege.\n\nThe new series clearly took notes from the successes and failures of the standalone series, especially the bumbling Iron Fist and the dull filler scenes that came with giving 13 episodes to the other four shows. The Defenders is a slim eight episodes, with just enough time to establish a solid team, villain and tension-packed storyline.\n\nAnd, luckily, the jabs at Iron Fist are abundant, mostly from Luke and Jessica and often in the form of exaggerated eye rolls. At one point, a fan-favorite makes his Defenders debut and calls Iron Fist the world's greatest fighter, but still a \"thundering dumbass.\"\n\nSpeaking of exciting returns, we get to see more of Elodie Yung, who played Elektra in Daredevil, in The Defenders. Her shadowy new role combines distant sadness with lethal talents.\n\nWhile the first two episodes are a slow burn building up to that fiery hallway fight scene from the trailer, the four episodes provided to critics prove this series isn't going to have a middle lull. It doesn't come off as four different characters mashed together, nor does it feel like an entirely separate original Marvel production. Through its audio, visuals and approach, The Defenders feels like the best of all four shows seamlessly connected.\n\nThe Defenders not only bring fresh perspectives to the table overflowing with NYC Chinese food, they show that their combined differences make them an unstoppable team.\n\nThose differences, coupled with a brooding tone that eerily matches each character, make The Defenders one of the best Marvel series yet.\n\nContact Chelsea Tatham at ctatham@tampabay.com.

It looks like we're going to get some more backstory for The Punisher than what was doled out in his brief introduction, but we'll also be tagging along with the vigilante as he carries out his own brand of justice in the city streets.

First, the comic giant's studio arm has to make the necessary (re)introductions to Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, whose team-up was scheduled before Charlie Cox first stepped into Hell's Kitchen. These callbacks are worked rather effortlessly into the new series' setup, but are still an effective crash course for anyone who missed out on one or all three of the previous entries. And there's just the right amount of exposition doled out amid Jessica's (Krysten Ritter) quipping and Danny Rand's (Finn Jones) bloviating that being unfamiliar with The Hand doesn't remain a problem for long.\n\nThe economical use of exposition and improved pacing are signs that Marvel Studios and Netflix have been taking notes on the solo series, which have notoriously been light on plot and meandered toward their conclusions. Those issues haven't been totally resolved; even with just eight episodes, showrunners Marco Ramirez and Douglas Petrie still manage to dawdle. But overall, The Defenders runs leaner and meaner (more on that in a bit) than any other Netflix Marvel show. Even under the lingering shadows, the first episode feels downright breezy at times, making surprisingly quick work of getting our heroes -- Matt Murdock (Cox), who's refusing to go by Daredevil; Jessica; Luke Cage (Mike Colter); and Danny, who just wants everyone to call him Iron Fist already, you guys -- back to New York.\n\nThis all happens in the premiere, which includes an unintentionally funny moment (or is it?) where Danny is surprised to learn someone actually recognizes him as Iron Fist. That throwaway line is part of what is, if not an outright admission of guilt, then an acknowledgment that momentum has been lost. It's not just that even the best outings (seasons one of Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Daredevil) unfolded at a fitful pace, but the groundwork that had been laid since 2015 was weakened, not reinforced, by Iron Fist. Scott Buck's contribution to the franchise suffered from a lack of urgency, underwhelming fight sequences, and Jones' wooden portrayal of the immortal warrior.\n\nIn order to recover ground, The Defenders ramps up the action by building off smaller confrontations and actually earning its midseason cliffhanger. Along the way, the show takes frequent swipes at Danny, usually via Jessica or Luke (Daredevil is sympathetic toward the oblivious billionaire, because of course he is). Many of the complaints critics and viewers had about Iron Fist work their way into the dialogue, including the privilege he isn't aware he's constantly benefiting from and asserting. At times, the criticism is shoehorned into the conversation; at others, it deals a more devastating blow than Danny's glowing fist.\n\nUnlike Daredevil (the character and the series), The Defenders doesn't dwell in self-flagellation mode. The first half of the season is a potent mix of humor, dread, and ass-kicking. Even with Iron Fist tagging along as the annoying younger brother -- who could buy and sell you and the building you live in a thousand times over -- the Defenders shine as a team and as individuals (well, most of them). Rather than hit pause on their larger arcs, the series explores different parts of Jessica's recovery and Matt's penitence, while fleshing out the stories of Luke's reentry and Danny's search for vengeance. Those elements are used to both forge and undermine their partnership. Everyone here is a loner, either by preference or circumstance, but they'll grudgingly work together to protect New York City, which offers something compelling enough to each character that it's treated as a living organism itself -- the gorgeous opening credits are made up of maps of the Big Apple, whose streets are CGI-ed to look like firing synapses and pulsing veins.\n\nAnd it really is the whole city that is increasingly under attack from The Hand, the clandestine organization first introduced in Daredevil, led here by Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver), an elegant but deadly adversary. Along with Madame Gao (Wai Ching Ho), who we first saw in Iron Fist, Alexandra primarily wants to take on -- or maybe take out -- Iron Fist. But she's also prepared to dispatch anyone who gets in her way. Enter the super-but-not-heroic friends, who finally band together by the end of episode three. Director Peter Hoar makes that outing mostly worth the wait, but The Defenders can't quite get away from wasting time.\n\nThe big-screen version of the MCU is frequently knocked for its one-note villains, but that's one issue that the Netflix series have mostly avoided. From Kingpin to Kilgrave to Cottonmouth, the streaming shows have offered up complex antagonists, who go beyond being egomaniacal evildoers. (Madame Gao could make this list, if she weren't up against such an unworthy foe). In Weaver's hands, Alexandra is formidable and intriguing, swaddled as she is in what often look like really expensive duvets. Although she's informed by other MCU villains -- Alexandra shares Ronan The Accuser's zealotry, Mariah's poise, and Ultron's indifference to the human condition -- she's much more than just an amalgam. She's closer to a time lord than a hand-rubbing baddie; she's both detached from and invested in humanity.\n\nWeaver's so good in the role that it's almost a waste to set her primarily against the Iron Fist. In a twist out of a comic, The Defenders comes up against one of its own, as Danny remains the weak link, and Jones appears petulant and almost boorish in the face of everyone else's soulfulness and poignancy. Ramirez and Petrie may have learned hard lessons about pacing, but they haven't added much to this character. Still, with Marvel series alumni S.J. Clarkson (who helmed the first two episodes), Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, and Phil Abraham on board, The Defenders has just as powerful a team offscreen as on, and looks ready to block any future blows from Iron Fist.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Metal_Craft", "wgt": 100, "id": 1242, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Metal Craft"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Kitchen,_Manhattan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217604"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304946", "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "349438", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349746", "label": {"eng": "Sympathetic nervous system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "389251", "label": {"eng": "Ultron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingpin_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "437318", "label": {"eng": "Kingpin (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Man", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "531012", "label": {"eng": "Purple Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottonmouth_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "599148", "label": {"eng": "Cottonmouth (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Petrie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "657633", "label": {"eng": "Doug Petrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Buck", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "751260", "label": {"eng": "Scott Buck"}}]}

Though their last stint, Iron Fist, was somewhat a bust, fans are hoping the hero can redeem himself with Marvel's The Defenders. Even if you're reluctant to watch it, you might want to give the power-packed series a shot. If you want to know what time and date The Defenders will premiere, then you came to the right place!\n\nMarvel fans are rejoicing over the announcement of The Defenders, which is a Marvel-Netflix collaboration like many we have seen before. The miniseries promises to be more action-packed and superhero-y than we've previously seen. The Defenders is expected to meet the high expectations of Marvel fans. So without further ado, here's the schedule for The Defenders season 1, episodes, and the show's cast.\n\nThe Defenders on Netflix follows four main characters -- Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Daredevil -- as they come together to fight common enemies.\n\nLuke Cage has super human strength and impenetrable skin. He has been loved by fans since the character's inception in the '70s. He's a convict who was imprisoned for crimes he did not commit, and volunteers for a procedure that leads him to gain super human strength. Mike Colter was first seen as Luke Cage in Netflix's Jessica Jones, before starring in his own show in 2016.\n\nJessica Campbell was put into an orphanage after her parents die in a car crash with a convoy carrying radioactive material. She survives the crash, but spends months in a coma. She is adopted by the Jones family and soon realizes that the exposure to the radioactive material gave her super human strength, as well as limited invulnerability and flight. In the show, she decides to give up her superhero past and becomes a private investigator with her firm, Alias.\n\nAfter the first season of Iron Fist, fans either loved or hated the character. It follows Danny Rand, a billionaire monk with martial arts training, who was believed to be dead for 15 years. He comes back to New York City in the hopes of getting back his company and his family. He learned how to focus his chi in order to summon what is known as the Iron Fist. Finn Jones plays Danny Rand, and though fans did not like the first season, some are optimistic that the character will redeem himself enough in The Defenders to make season 2 of Iron Fist worth watching.\n\nDaredevil was the first Marvel hero to be brought to Netflix. He is blind, but his other senses are heightened, allowing him to fight crime just as well (if not better than) other superheroes. Daredevil is the alias of Matt Murdock, a lawyer who was blinded as a young boy. He can sense changes in pressure, temperature, weather, and heat. He is fast, agile, and is super flexible, making him a master of a hybrid martial arts form. Charlie Cox will don his red suit in The Defenders, as fans eagerly await the third season of Daredevil.\n\nThe Defenders season 1 trailer shows a whole lot of action and fun, as the team slowly come together and prepare to face new threats in New York.

The heroes of New York are finally coming together, and diehard fans will want to watch the second the miniseries is released.\n\nThose who want to be first to see the series will need to get some caffeine. All eight episodes of \"The Defenders\" will be released at 3 a.m. EDT on Friday, Aug. 18. West coasters won't need quite as much coffee. They'll be able to see it at the same time, 12 a.m. PDT.\n\nMuch like \"Daredevil,\" \"Jessica Jones,\" \"Luke Cage\" and \"Iron Fist,\" \"The Defenders\" can only be watched on Netflix. If you somehow managed to avoid the streaming platform for this long, it's easy to get started. Simply choose one of the subscription plans, which start from $7.99 a month, and watch either on Netflix's website or app. New users get a month free, which will be plenty of time to watch all eight episodes of the superhero season. Those planning to watch all five of the Marvel/Netflix series during the 30-day trial will want to plan their binge-watching more carefully.\n\n\"Marvel's The Defenders\" will be available for binge-watching starting Aug. 18. Photo: Netflix\n\n\"The Defenders\" was announced in 2013 when Marvel first revealed they'd be teaming up with the streaming service for several television shows. Daredevil debuted in 2015, and a new season of a superhero shows has premiered every spring and fall since then on Netflix.\n\nWhile Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) and Luke Cage (Mike Colter) already met, it'll be the first time the rest of the group learn of each other's existence. Daredevil (Charlie Cox) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) round out the band of superheroes. They'll all come together after discovering that a new evil, led by the mysterious Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver), is threatening New York.\n\nIn typical Marvel fashion, not much has been revealed about \"The Defenders.\" While Alexandra is definitely the one the Defenders are fighting, it isn't clear what exactly she's doing. Sneak peeks have made it seem like she is above Madame Gao (Wai Ching Ho), who runs the Hand, and Marvel revealed that she is going to bring back Elektra (Elodie Yung) from the dead. That indicates she's pretty powerful.\n\nWeaver has given some vague descriptions of her character. \"To me, Alexandra has a lot of wisdom because she's been doing what she does for a long time and she has a lot of empathy,\" Weaver told the Guardian. \"She's a very complex character and I felt delighted to be a part of that. There's also a lot of comedy, action and a lot of great character work, plus a lot of surprises in the show.\"\n\nLuckily, there are a lot of heroes to fight the complicated antagonist. \"The Defenders\" isn't just bringing together the four leads. Their supporting characters are coming along for the ride too. Of course, Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) will be there to unite the heroes.

The miniseries will feature the four lead characters from four different shows who are teaming up in order to defeat a common enemy that threatens the city.\n\nThe trailer gives a glimpse of the dynamics between the characters, solitary figures in their respective television series, who are coming together for the first time with one goal. Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Mike Colter (Luke Cage), and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) will work together to bring down the criminal empire known as The Hand.\n\nThe team will need to find a way to scale down their own egos in order to mesh with one another. Clips hinting at possible in-fighting within the group are shown in the trailer, as Scott Glenn's Stick, who was Daredevil's childhood mentor, comes to band the group together. Jones' Iron Fist is hinted at to be the show's comic relief. He is also seen performing some combos with the indestructible Luke Cage.\n\nSigourney Weaver will star as Alexandra, the head of the villainous organization The Hand, which had been working behind the scenes during the events of \"Daredevil.\"\n\nThe team-up is coming after two seasons of \"Daredevil\" and one season each of \"Iron Fist,\" \"Luke Cage,\" and \"Jessica Jones.\" All three shows received positive critical responses upon their release. However, \"Iron Fist\" did not do very well as far as the critics were concerned. It remains to be seen if \"The Defenders\" can elevate the character to a better standing.\n\nHaving three of the most acclaimed Marvel television shows teaming up and adding a science fiction legend in Weaver, the \"The Defenders\" looks to hit the ground running.

Ever since his initial casting, Bernthal was pegged to be the perfect Frank Castle, and he proved just as much once he debuted in Daredevil season 2. His tragic backstory helped make a ruthless killer sympathetic to a degree, but it was his moments of violence that stuck with viewers. Fans instantly demanded Punisher get his own show and Marvel and Netflix agreed that was the route to take.\n\nHannibal's Steve Lightfoot is serving as showrunner on The Punisher, with Deborah Ann Woll set to recur as Karen Page (building on her relationship with Frank in Daredevil). Woll and Bernthal are being joined by Ben Barnes, Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Micro), Amber Rose Revah (Dinah Madani), Michael Nathanson (Sam Stein), and more. With The Defenders now out, Marvel and Netflix have debuted the first teaser for their next series.\n\nRelated: Recapping The Road To The Defenders\n\nMarvel/Netflix attached the first Punisher teaser to the end of The Defenders (see the video above), offering fans their first look at Castle's solo series. With fans anxious to see more of Punisher's story since the beginning of 2016, the first trailer does not disappoint in reestablishing the anti-hero as a man on a mission of his own, doing whatever it takes to get the job done.\n\nThe teaser may be shorter and less brutal than some were hoping for, but still does a great job at establishing the tone the show is going for. With much of the trailer set to Castle making his logo in the concrete, there are flashes of what else the series will hold. Flashbacks to Frank's days in the military are on display, but glimpses of him punishing some of his enemies with a shotgun also fill out the trailer. Other quick flashes of scenes from the actual Punisher series likewise appear here.\n\nUnfortunately, the teaser does not offer up any looks at the supporting cast of new characters or give further insight to what the plot of the spinoff will be. Barnes has previously teased that the show is about men suffering tragedy and trauma, and this theme should play out not only for Frank, but also many of the others on the series. With this being just the start of Punisher's marketing, future trailers should tease fans with more memorable moments that what has been shown before. Still, his is a good teaser to kick everything off.\n\nNEXT: The Defenders Comic-Con Footage Description\n\nThe Defenders is now available on Netflix, with The Punisher arriving sometime this fall. Premiere dates for the new seasons of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist have not yet been announced.\n\nSource: Marvel/Netflix\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

How will she look to harm The Defenders? Will a former villain like Wilson Fisk show up?\n\nThere's also the Punisher, who debuted in season 2 of Daredevil. It's possible he plays a role on The Defenders, before getting his own show near the end of 2017. That will be the sixth Marvel show to air on Netflix.\n\nSo, when will these heroes (and others) be seen on Netflix? Friday, Aug. 18 will be the date, with a 3:00 a.m. ET release, which is 12:00 a.m. PT. It's an early time for a show to be released, but those waiting for The Defenders to air amidst the lengthy gap between shows, will jump to Netflix to watch the first episode -- maybe all eight.

However, that is not the only crossover that Marvel and Defenders fans are longing for. Ever since these shows were announced, fans have been wondering when we might be able to see these characters appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe proper or when we might see a movie character appear on one of the shows.\n\nCurrently, though, there seems to be a divide between Marvel Television and Marvel Studios. They always like to say \"it's all connected,\" but the most we get in the Netflix world is the occasional reference to \"magic hammers\" or \"the green guy\" or \"the incident.\" Marvel's ABC shows have been given a bit more love, with characters like Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Colbie Smulders' Maria Hill or Jaimie Alexander's Lady Sif showing up from time to time on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., but we still haven't seen much crossover in the way of actual Avengers appearing on the show or characters like Daisy Johnson/Quake (Chloe Bennet) appearing in a Marvel film.\n\nWho knows if we'll ever actually see these two worlds clash in a way that is satisfying to both fans of the films and fans of the shows, but it sure is a heck of a lot of fun to dream. With these worlds so populated by superheroes, the possibilities are endless, but there are quite a few crossovers that we already know we would love to see.\n\nBefore we begin with this list, I would like to note that this article may feature spoilers for some of the Marvel Netflix series up until this point, including Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist. However, I have not seen any episodes of The Defenders yet, so there will be no intentional spoilers for that show.\n\nSo, without further adieu, here are the ten crossovers between Netflix's The Defenders and the Marvel Cinematic Universe films that we want to see.

That correction takes time, however - a lot of time. And in an event series only eight episodes in length, spending nearly half that time before Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and the Insufferable Iron Fist himself, Danny Rand, are gathered in the same room, much less toying with the notion of teaming up, the wait can seem interminable.\n\nIn five separate seasons of television, Marvel's Netflix series have revolved around heroes who don't necessarily play nice with others, making the idea of a team-up an intriguingly unlikely proposition, the necessity of which is the driving concern of the event's first half. But that necessity remains frustratingly obfuscated during those four hours as the actual team is scattered across four more or less disparate plots. It's a storytelling choice that demonstrates the importance of (and these series' utter reliance on) Netflix's all-at-once binge-watch delivery. If The Defenders was being rolled out on a weekly basis, and viewers were asked to wait four weeks before the heroes threw their first collective punch, fans would riot. The series takes its sweet time reasoning why, exactly, these heroes must come together, and even then it's not an entirely convincing argument.\n\nThe hurry-up-and-wait storytelling shepherded by showrunner Marco Ramirez bounces from one hero to the next via sometimes jarring transitions meant to remind the viewer the story takes place in New York. They do help shift the focus from, say, Matt to Luke, or Danny to Jessica, as the series takes a solid swing toward altering the look and sound of each segment based on the character in question. But somehow, the transitions also feel dated and unnecessary, like The Defenders has inadvertently become an '80s-set period piece (which, actually, would work pretty well). Thankfully, once the various members of the unconventional team start spending more time with one another, there's less need to make those transitions and everything begins to fall into place.\n\nBut it takes a long time to get there. The first four hours are a mix of what makes shared universes so appealing and so frustrating at the same time. The Defenders isn't really The Defenders until final moments of episode 4. Up until that point, it's Daredevil season 2.5, and Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist seasons 1.5. The continuity between the various series is impressive to a certain degree, as The Defenders is diligent in its handling of the connective tissue of those particular storylines. Matt Murdock is fighting to not be Daredevil and he explains as much to Karen Paige following a major legal victory for his fledgling solo legal career. Luke Cage is released from prison thanks to the help of Foggy Nelson and Jeri Hogarth's law firm. Elsewhere, Jessica Jones is pretty much at the bottom of a bottle of whisky, while Danny Rand and Colleen Wing are chasing not-so-mysterious ninja assassins around the globe.\n\nPicking up with each character at these various points is great from a continuity standpoint. The length to which the series goes to connect each individual series as seamlessly as possible is admirable in the grand MCU scheme of it all. But approaching it in that way ultimately does a disservice to the likes of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, as the need for expediency undercuts the less superhero-y aspects of their stories. Matt Murdock's attempts to deal with the fallout of his identity reveal to Karen, and Danny's efforts to amend for leaving K'un-Lun unguarded works fine.\n\nIt's one thing to have these surface-level superhero plotlines picked up, dropped, or blended into another because that's what they're designed to do. It's another to see The Defenders blow past the significance of Luke's recent prison stint or Jessica's seemingly stunted attempt to push past her fatal encounter with Kilgrave. These are more personal storylines that speak to the core of who these characters are, and they need more time to develop and be properly explored. And because The Defenders is ultimately at the mercy of both the Marvel continuity machine and its own plot maneuverings, it doesn't juggle the Cage and Jones arcs as well as it could have. Despite clearly having ample time to devote to both storylines, the series speeds past them far too quickly.\n\nIt becomes a matter of time management. If The Defenders won't devote the time necessary to its characters' arcs then it could at least channel its energies into creating a compelling villain and reason for the Defenders to form in the first place. Instead, the first half of the series frustrates with a disinclination to make the Hand interesting or to be up front about Sigourney Weaver's Alexandra.\n\nEverything noteworthy about her is shrouded in mystery, and for the first four hours all the audience is given are the dying parts of a much larger and potentially more interesting whole. Alexandra is potentially centuries old and powerful enough that Madame Gao fears her. She's also responsible for bringing Elektra back to life, and because she's dying, her plan (whatever it is) must be accelerated, putting her and the Hand on the radar of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist. Again, it's a simple set-up for an otherwise simple team-up narrative that becomes unnecessarily complicated by virtue of proving its shared universe bona fides.\n\nThe time and effort expounded on behalf of picking up where everyone left off feels even more redundant once the heroes are actually together, playing off one another's dissimilar personalities and, in the case of Luke and Danny or Matt and Jessica, finding they have an entertaining chemistry. Maybe there's something to be said for delaying the gratification of seeing the Heroes For Hire nosh on dim sum, or listening to Jessica's obvious fascination with her blind lawyer's uncanny abilities, but probably not. This is the show. When the heroes gather, it is the payoff to the conceit of the entire series; it's exactly what you want The Defenders to be.\n\nThat is why it's so confounding that after five solo efforts, Marvel still hasn't quite figured out the pacing of its Netflix series so that they make every minute count. Streaming drift is a problem experienced by most shows on Netflix, and certainly the Marvel series are susceptible to it as well. It's that part of the season that bridges the beginning with the climax where nothing much happens but you keep watching anyway because the episodes just keep playing automatically. With just eight episodes rather than the usual thirteen, you might have though The Defenders had found the most logical way of avoiding the drift, but instead it's just there from the onset.\n\nIn that regard, considering the cliffhanger on which episode 4 ends, and the fact that Marvel and Netflix were determined to keep the final four hours a secret, The Defenders stands to be heavily reliant on the back half when all is said and done. As the plot ramps up and Alexandra's plan comes to a head, the series will have every opportunity to make good on the entertaining chemistry of its four leads, and to add plenty more action into the mix. As such, The Defenders finds itself ready to cash in on a promising development found halfway through its eight-episode run, which makes the prospect of watching the final episodes much more appealing than, say, finishing season 1 of Iron Fist.

As we learned in a surprise reveal recently, joining them will be Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle, aka the gun-toting vigilante The Punisher. Don't expect him to get in on the hero action though, as the Punisher has never strictly been one of the good guys. Sure he's fighting criminals, but his methods are a bit more... extreme.\n\nWe'll get to see even more of his particularly violent brand of justice when Bernthal headlines a solo Punisher series later this year, spinning out of his debut in Daredevil season two. And as Bernthal explains (via CinemaBlend), there's no intention of reining the Punisher in just because he's the lead of a TV series now.\n\nI always want to preserve the essence of Frank, and have the right and be bold enough to really turn my back on the audience, and not do things to win the audience's favor, but rather stay true to the character and the essence of who he is. I think Frank is brutal. Frank is damaged. Frank is tortured. I think Frank, when he engages in violence, there's something utterly satisfying and addictive for him to be doing that, and that may not be something that the audience can agree with or get behind.\n\nBut I've always fought to preserve that, and I think that that's a part of him. I think the pain and what's behind the violence and the reason why he's committing the violence, that's a different story. I want to explore that, too. So I think that's the real challenge: being bold enough to not make him too heroic, at least 'heroic,' is important to me. That being said, I think there's Frank Castle inside of everybody. I think being a father and being a husband, he's a character that I deeply empathize with.\n\nWe've had four different on-screen renditions of Frank Castle already, and I think it's safe to say that Bernthal's version of the skull-emblazoned vigilante introduced in the second season of Daredevil has been the best (sorry, Thomas Jane, you've been dethroned). A lot of that has to do with how well Bernthal balances the tragic with the homicidal in his portrayal of the character, and I'm glad they're not toning down the latter all.\n\nThe Punisher solo series doesn't have an official release date yet, but it's expected it will be releasing in just a couple months time in November.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "wgt": 100, "id": 171, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "wgt": 100, "id": 232, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building_Types", "wgt": 100, "id": 369, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building Types"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305611", "label": {"eng": "Reining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilante", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308262", "label": {"eng": "Vigilante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "342245", "label": {"eng": "Punisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "342256", "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bernthal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "468287", "label": {"eng": "Jon Bernthal"}}]}

Since the early days of the Netflix Marvel machine, it's been promised that the heroes would join forces just as cinematic icons like Iron Man and Captain America formed a supergroup in \"The Avengers.\" And so we get what is essentially the TV version of that concept as the standalone series \"Daredevil,\" \"Jessica Jones,\" \"Luke Cage\" and \"Iron Fist\" unite to form \"The Defenders,\" premiering in its entirety this Friday, August 18 on Netflix. While it's undeniably fun to see at least three of these charismatic characters come together, \"The Defenders\" suffers from the same bloat that has been plaguing Netflix series of late -- everything feels like it's moving much slower than it needs to in order to stretch out a thin plot to a season length. There's something happening in the world of Netflix that's turning into a disease across all television, as I've noticed other shows fall apart when it comes to pacing. Not everything can sustain an hour-long episode length or a 13-episode season (although it should be noted this one is just eight). And there's a difference between deliberate plotting and the wheel-spinning we so often get from Netflix lately. \"The Defenders\" may end up being Exhibit A in this problem. The heroes don't even get together until the end of episode three. And, honestly, you could start watching there and not miss too much.\n\nAll four of the characters are essentially where we left them. Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) is keeping his superhero identity of Daredevil under wraps for the most part, choosing to fight crime as an attorney more often than he does as a blind, ass-kicking vigilante. Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) is a reluctant private eye, but more easily recognized on the street by those hoping she can help them. Luke Cage (Mike Colter) is at Seagate Prison to start the season, but gets out relatively quickly, returning to Harlem to be its savior, hoping to continue his fight to protect the downtrodden and disenfranchised. Iron Fist (Finn Jones) is the most active of the quartet to start, picking up where he left off, in a battle against The Hand with his lover and partner-in-ass-kicking Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick).\n\nThe first two episodes of \"The Defenders\" slowly move the four characters into each other's narratives. For example, Jessica gets a case of a missing man that turns out to be much more than it first seems. Luke tries to protect a young man who may be getting wooed into the criminal underworld. Iron Fist continues to seek out The Hand. And all of this happens under the shadow of mysterious happenings in New York City, including a bizarre, unexplainable earthquake. We know that someone named Alexandra (played with steely determination by Sigourney Weaver) is this year's \"Big Bad,\" but her identity is mysterious. She appears to be a power player in business and social stature in New York City, but it's also revealed pretty quickly that she may have a supernatural side as well, and we learn that she's directly involved with The Hand. Before long, she's controlling the Black Sky, a resurrected Elektra (Elodie Yung), who has essentially become a memory-less killing machine. Why? What does Alexandra want? And can The Defenders work together to stop her?\n\n\"The Defenders\" is loaded with familiar faces in an attempt to keep fans of the first four series as happy as possible just from the joy of being reunited with characters they've loved in the past. It's not just the quartet. Foggy Nelson, Misty Knight, Claire Temple, Trish Walker, Malcolm Ducasse, Jeri Hogarth, and even Scott Glenn's awesome Stick resurface, some of them in key roles. But what's startling about all of this is that it still doesn't feel like a real universe has been created. I realized watching \"The Defenders\" how little depth there is to all of this, and how much seeing these recurring characters didn't feel like world-building as much as it did fan service. There's a crucial difference. Part of the problem is that \"The Defenders\" lacks when it comes to visual language and production design, even when compared to shows like \"Daredevil\" and \"Luke Cage,\" which used Hell's Kitchen and Harlem, respectively, as vibrant backgrounds. There's a sense here of obligation instead of artistic intent.\n\n\"The Defenders\" works best as a series of moments. Seeing Weaver and Glenn go at it as long-standing villain and hero has an undeniable energy simply because both performers are so good. There's a fight scene at the end of episode three that's so well-staged that it reminds you how half-asleep you've been for the previous three hours. However, it's easy to believe there will be more like it in the back half of the season and fans will forget about the slow set-up. There are character beats that work too, particularly in the way Cage and Jones mock Iron Fist's self-seriousness and inexperience. Colter and Ritter are undeniably charismatic. And Cox is good as the reticent Daredevil, the de facto leader of this group, if only because he's the only Defender to have two seasons of background (and a lot of his supporting cast returns).\n\nIn the end, \"The Defenders\" ticks enough boxes that fans will likely overlook its flaws. In other words, it does pretty much what it needed to do to keep the Netflix Marvel Universe humming along to the next seasons of \"Jessica Jones\" and \"Luke Cage.\" It's a bridge more than an artistic accomplishment in its own right. If that's enough for you, that's fine, but with all the build-up and all the hype for this superhero supergroup, no one would blame you for expecting a little more.", "date": "2017-08-15",

Good and justice in the world, obviously, since they're superheroes. And then... what else? If past Marvel shows like Jessica Jones are an instrument, delicately tuned for individual stories about the complications of vigilantism, the new Netflix crossover series The Defenders is a blunt object swinging into a car window.\n\nThe Defenders unites the protagonists of Netflix's Marvel shows Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil, and Iron Fist. It picks up after the end of the latter series, with Danny Rand still hunting down members of the deadly organization known as the Hand. His findings lead him to believe the Hand is preoccupied with New York City, also home to the rest of the would-be Defenders. Jessica Jones is tracking a case, Matt Murdock is brought in as her lawyer, and Luke Cage is trying to help a local kid who's gotten mixed up with the wrong crowd. Their individual pursuits eventually lead them all to the same place at the same time, and chaos ensues. The group grudgingly has to unite to take down the Hand.\n\nThe Defenders pairs its heroes nicely, allowing Luke and Danny, or Jessica and Matt, to play off each other in ways that benefit them all. Danny is a poster boy for privileged white-guy appropriation, thanks to rich parents and a dive into the mystical martial arts. Luke Cage is a compassionate, level-headed hero with an eye out for the little guy. Daredevil is a vigilante with a guilty conscience and a tendency to jump into super ninja mode at a moment's notice. Jessica Jones is witty and no-nonsense, more likely to snap a photo as hard evidence of someone acting strangely than to chase them down.\n\nThere's genuine joy in the moments when the gang is together. Fight scenes unfold as beautifully choreographed free-for-alls, where a rewatch is encouraged to visually scoop up every last bit of action. The show understands physical camaraderie. Everyone feels like they're pulling their weight, whether their power is bulletproof skin or a glowing fist. And the comedy between them is real, whether it's Jessica dressing down Daredevil with a sharp observation, or Danny Rand finally playing the comedic role his character seems best suited for.\n\nBut before The Defenders can gather its eponymous supergroup, it has to get them all together. The show suffers from a slow start and a disorienting tonal mix that makes its early episodes feel off balance. In their individual series, these characters have definite themes or feelings. Jessica Jones is a dark noir infused with trauma; Luke Cage is a mix of funk and hip-hop poured over an exploration of modern problems in Harlem. Compared with the more ludicrous ideas of these series -- Daredevil and especially Iron Fist's obsession with ninjas and the mystic -- The Defenders shifts in ways that demand constant adjustment.\n\nRather than creating a single, new vibe for the show, The Defenders gives each character their own mini-stories. It's like a summarized version of each series, boiled down to the base-level ideas to familiarize viewers with each hero's agenda. And in case you've forgotten who's who, the show is shot in a way to visually remind you every time. Heroes are often lit with their theme color: red for Daredevil, yellow for Luke Cage, and so on. And when they're all together? The show not-so-subtly has all colors present. It's a bizarre, often distracting choice, and it adds a layer of camp to the show that its heroes never quite match.\n\nBut superheroes only need one great unifier: a villain worth fighting. The Defenders has a strong choice in Sigourney Weaver's Alexandra, a villain by way of Daredevil's Wilson Fisk. She's deadly and cunning, but she masks her threat with taste, elegance, and class. Weaver is a commanding force in the role, a perpetually calm voice in even the most ridiculous scenarios. Like the ragtag group of superheroes she faces, Alexandra has a counterpart of her own in Elektra, first introduced in Daredevil as a love interest. The once complex antiheroine has been stripped of all personality to become a human weapon, and a point of conflict for the blind vigilante.\n\nComing off Iron Fist, inarguably the worst of the four Netflix / Marvel series, The Defenders bears hallmarks of that show's shortcomings. It sometimes flails in its writing, especially in exploring the Hand and its devious doings. But where Iron Fist took itself too seriously, The Defenders has the advantage of better-grounded characters to offset its most ridiculous moments.\n\nSeries like Jessica Jones and Luke Cage have taught us that Marvel shows have the potential to say something outside of the superhero realm. The Defenders never captures that level of intensity or inquisitive thought. It's a team-up story: good guys coming together to thwart evil in the simplest sense. Its nuance is on par with Iron Fist punching people through walls.\n\nAnd it can't replicate the free-flying spirit of a super-saga like The Avengers. Instead, it lands somewhere between. It's a more playful turn for these heroes, who rarely have so many chances to joke and banter with other friendly faces back in their own shows. It never earns its over-active taste for flair and occasionally stumbles to find the right balance. It's a crowd-pleaser that hits just enough notes to succeed -- nothing more, and nothing less.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 1010, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 100, "id": 1284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_crossover", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "343622", "label": {"eng": "Fictional crossover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingpin_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "437318", "label": {"eng": "Kingpin (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}]}

Along with three other shows - Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist - Daredevil would lead to The Defenders, an eight-episode 'event' miniseries, and serial television's answer to The Avengers on the cinema screen.\n\nWhen The Defenders launches tomorrow, fans will have been waiting two years, four months and eight days for that team-up of Marvel's street level heroes - but having had early access to the first half of the series (Netflix has only made episodes 1-4 available for review), we're sad to say they'll be waiting another three hours to see the team together. That's right - despite the truncated episode run, The Defenders falls victim to the same interminable slow-burn malaise that's afflicted most of the Marvel shows to date.\n\nTaking almost half of the entire season to bring the full team together is a bizarre decision, making the first two episodes feel especially drawn-out, with much of the opening episodes spent checking in on the main characters since the ends of their respective shows. Matt Murdock (Cox) is winning court cases, Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) is still a hard-drinking private investigator trying to avoid the limelight, Luke Cage (Mike Colter) is being released from prison, and Danny Rand/Iron Fist and Colleen Wing (Finn Jones and Jessica Henwick) are hunting members of The Hand - a conspiratorial organisation of super ninjas, which has been a recurrent antagonist throughout the Marvel shows - in Cambodia.\n\nAmple attention is also given to establishing Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver), the antagonist of the series. With connections to The Hand and its long-whispered \"plans\" for New York City, she sets in motion a cataclysm that warrants bringing the heroes together... by the final act of episode three. Weaver's casting is perfect for the role, bringing gravitas and menace to a character who is also desperately vulnerable in ways we won't spoil.\n\nThankfully, The Defenders picks up steam in its fourth episode, with not only the main team physically together, but slowly, reluctantly bonding, even if most of them have little interest in actually teaming-up. If the two-year lead up to this event was good for one thing, it's that the lead actors are all settled in their characters now, allowing for some great chemistry as their distinct personalities bounce off each other.\n\nThe counterpoint is that The Defenders is, by its nature, almost totally inaccessible to newcomers. The established relationships - Luke and Jessica, for instance - or the presence of Elektra (Elodie Yung) after the events of Daredevil season two, or how nurse Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson) seems to improbably know all of the team members, all require viewers to have watched the previous shows. That was always the intent though, building on the success of the standalone shows, but this lacks the accessibility The Avengers had, even if you'd missed Iron Man, Thor, Captain America or The Incredible Hulk.\n\nThat makes the ponderous set-up even more confusing. The series is, and was only ever, meant for people who've been following the saga from the beginning - so why waste so much screen time on labourious, drawn-out scene setting?\n\nFor those who have fully invested in the franchise though, The Defenders showrunner Marco Ramirez seems to have responded subtly to viewer reception of earlier shows. Danny Rand is less, well, irritating than he was in his own show, coming across with the kind of charming wide-eyed na\u00efvet\u00e9 that Iron Fist told viewers he had (as a result of being raised in an extra-dimensional city by mystical martial artists, of course) but rarely showed in practice. Murdock, in turn, is less abrasive than in Daredevil, more focused on trying to put his costumed identity behind him and find penance in his daylight work, while Cage remains the moral centre; his real strength coming from conviction as much as super strength and bulletproof skin.\n\nIt's little surprise that Ritter steals most scenes as Jessica Jones, always ready with a quippy put-down and frequently breaking off from the boys' club to pursue her own leads. Ironically then, its Jones' investigations - initially drawn into a separate case that draws her into The Hand's orbit - that really start to bring the disparate heroes' goals together into a common purpose. The reluctance of Jones and the others to formally come together, and then endlessly bickering when they do, is actually a nice nod to the very different origins of The Defenders in the comics. There, Doctor Strange, The Hulk, Silver Surfer, and Sub-Mariner were loosely affiliated as a \"non-team\".\n\nAction scenes, when they occur in these set-up episodes, thankfully fall more into the Daredevil school than the Iron Fist one, with well-choreographed set pieces emphasising the more grounded skill set of these characters. Iron Fist has the only visually showy power, and that often takes a back seat. We're pleased to see there's another corridor fight too - something of a staple of the Netflix Marvel series now, though here not quite as blistering as the ones in Daredevil.\n\nBy the end of episode four - the exact midpoint of the series - The Defenders will likely have long-term viewers hooked, with plot threads dating back to Daredevil season one finally drawn tight, the team assembled, and a massive throwdown about to occur. Hopefully, this acceleration continues through the rest of the series, as there's plenty to enjoy here, if the show can avoid falling back on bad habits of slow pacing and navel gazing.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309419", "label": {"eng": "Iron Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311156", "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "311296", "label": {"eng": "Hulk (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311303", "label": {"eng": "Thor (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "322695", "label": {"eng": "Namor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "333570", "label": {"eng": "Captain America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349310", "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Strange", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "368593", "label": {"eng": "Doctor Strange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "409370", "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Surfer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "481678", "label": {"eng": "Silver Surfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Wing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555508", "label": {"eng": "Colleen Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Henwick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "749745", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Henwick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1288996", "label": {"eng": "Claire Temple"}}]}

Just as the Marvel Cinematic Universe united Iron Man and Captain America, The Defenders is the first all-star gathering of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist. The first season of The Defenders premieres on Friday, August 18, but if you haven't been watching all four shows -- or you just forgot some of the details -- Vulture is here to help guide the way.\n\nThe Good Guys\n\nDaredevil, a.k.a. Matt Murdock\n\nMarvel's first Netflix series is probably still the most popular, having developed a serious fan base over two seasons. As a result, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox), is the de facto leader of the Defenders -- the Tony Stark/Iron Man of the group, if you will. He's also the only Defender who has to struggle to maintain a secret identity as he keeps the legal part of his life and his superhero side separate. Blind attorney by day, ass-kicking vigilante at night, Daredevil battled two legendary Marvel characters in his show -- the Kingpin and the Punisher -- and the second season ended with a fight against a notoriously villainous group known as the Hand (more on them later). At the end of that second season, Matt decided he would rather be an attorney than Daredevil, but the return of the Hand will make that difficult for the Hell's Kitchen superhero. It's also interesting that several of Daredevil's compatriots return for The Defenders, including Elektra Natchios (Elodie Yung), Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll), Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson), Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), and Stick (Scott Glenn). Daredevil may not be the best Marvel series on Netflix, but it's the most essential leading up to The Defenders.\n\nJessica Jones\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe's first leading female superhero finally makes her big return. Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) is the wisecracking member of the Defenders, the one just as likely to insult the enemy as kick his ass. She has super strength, but she's also the detective of the quartet, the one who knows how to track down a lead before she starts busting heads. At the end of her first season, Jones got vengeance on the evil Kilgrave -- who previously controlled her mind and subjected her to psychosexual torture -- and was arrested for his murder, but she was soon released and celebrated as a hero. Having no secret identity, her inability to hide behind a mask has made her famous, but she's not exactly eager to be the new Captain America. At the start of The Defenders, she's drinking herself to a stupor most nights and in no hurry to fight evil. Also, Jones has a tumultuous past with another Defender: Before she and Luke Cage had a one-night stand, Kilgrave forced Jones to kill Luke's wife.\n\nLuke Cage\n\nThe most outwardly heroic member of the Defenders, Luke Cage (Mike Colter) is a legend in Harlem, especially after facing off against local kingpins Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes (Mahershala Ali) and Mariah Dillard (Alfre Woodard) in his show's first season. Luke has super strength like Jessica Jones, but he's also invulnerable to almost all attacks, and he embraces his role as a protector of the downtrodden far more than Daredevil or Jones. Of course, doing so has given him a very public profile. At the end of the first season, Cage was arrested and sent back to Seagate Prison -- where he was previously incarcerated for a crime he didn't commit, then experimented upon -- and he's still inside Seagate at the opening of The Defenders. That doesn't last long, of course: Cage's desire to protect his community helps lead to the formation of the supergroup.\n\nIron Fist, a.k.a. Danny Rand\n\nThe least popular Defender debuted earlier this year in the form of Danny Rand (Finn Jones), a spoiled rich kid who was stranded in remote Tibet after a plane crash killed his parents. He was rescued by monks who raised him in the mystical city of K'un-Lun, where became a legendary martial-arts expert known as Iron Fist. Danny is the pretty boy of the Defenders, the one who lacks the grit of Luke Cage or Jessica Jones, but still has the desire to do what's right. Crucially, he's also got the most history with the Hand. At the end of his season, Danny and his partner Colleen Wing reached the gates of K'un-Lun, only to discover a pile of dead Hand assassins and the city apparently destroyed. The mystery about what happened to K'un-Lun segues directly into the very first scene of The Defenders, as Danny and Colleen's investigation will lead them to New York.\n\nThe Bad Guys\n\nThe Hand\n\nThe Hand is an ancient organization that has controlled the world for as long as anyone can remember. Think of them as a more violent version of the Illuminati conspiracy theory: a nefarious group of immortal puppet masters who pull the strings on everything.\n\nAlexandra Reid\n\nThe Big Bad of The Defenders is a mysterious woman named Alexandra Reid, played with icy aplomb by Sigourney Weaver. Reid's exact role in The Defenders is a mystery for now, but what you should know -- and what the show reveals almost immediately -- is that she plays a leading part in the Hand's return, which makes sense given how prominent the group was in Daredevil and Iron Fist.\n\nElektra Natchios\n\nAt the end of Daredevil's second season, Elektra sacrificed herself to save Matt Murdock in his battle against the Hand. But after the Hand exhumed her body and revived her as a superhuman killing machine named \"Black Sky,\" Elektra has fallen totally under control of the bad guys -- and she doesn't remember anything about her past life.\n\nThe Sidekicks\n\nClaire Temple\n\nFirst introduced in Daredevil, the savvy nurse played by Rosario Dawson has been the connective tissue between all of Marvel's Netflix shows, appearing in every single one. She's worked with each hero in different ways -- sometimes using her medical skills to stitch them up after battle -- and she's romantically tied to Luke Cage at the beginning of The Defenders.\n\nStick\n\nScott Glenn returns in the role of blind sensei who trained Matt Murdock and has waged war against the Hand for decades. Think of him as the Professor X of the group, although a bit rougher around the edges.\n\nJeri Hogarth\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss plays this high-powered lawyer who's got significant history with Jones and Rand. She's something of a legal protector for these heroes, helping out by pulling strings whenever they need to be pulled.\n\nDetective Misty Knight\n\nSimone Missick returns as the NYPD detective who worked with Luke Cage in his first season. With two other possible love interests in Cage's world -- Jones and Temple -- it feels like Misty will be more of a conduit to police activity in Harlem in The Defenders.\n\nFoggy Nelson and Karen Page\n\nElden Henson and Deborah Ann Woll are also back as Matt Murdock's main allies in The Defenders. If you haven't watched Daredevil, here's the gist of it: Matt's friendship with Foggy hit a rocky patch over his desire to be Daredevil, so Foggy left their blue-collar law practice to work for Jeri Hogarth's corporate firm, and Matt revealed his secret identity to Karen at the very end of the last season. In other words, both relationships need some serious reconciliation.\n\nColleen Wing\n\nJessica Henwick returns as martial-arts expert Colleen Wing, a former member of the Hand who turned against the evil group to fight alongside Danny. After she and Danny learn that K'un-Lun was attacked, they start an globe-hopping investigation to figure out what happened.\n\nTrish Walker and Malcolm Ducasse\n\nRachael Taylor pops up early in The Defenders, reprising her role as Jessica's best friend and New York's favorite talk-radio host. Meanwhile, Eka Darville returns as Jessica's neighbor and assistant, who convinces her to investigate the missing-person case that sparks the first arc of the series.\n\nThe Punisher, a.k.a. Frank Castle\n\nJon Bernthal will reportedly return as the Punisher, but how that'll happen is still unclear.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 100, "id": 7, "label":

Some high-voltage punchfests. But is there more to Marvel's The Defenders than fights and tights?\n\nIt's the third episode of The Defenders and everything is clicking into place. Danny Rand, the impetuous billionaire with a really strong fist, has confronted the evil organisation The Hand. But he's alone. And even with his well-honed fighting skills, he's in trouble. Pinned to a table by some martial arts ninjas, Rand's fate looks sealed. But then the Defenders enter, and the episode - not to mention the series - explodes into life with one of the best fight scenes ever seen in a Netflix Marvel show. And that is saying something.\n\nUntil now, the show has focused on the individual stories of its four protagonists. Mild-mannered attorney Matthew Murdock, AKA the abrasive-mannered Daredevil, has devoted himself to the law. Private eye Jessica Jones is devoting herself to drinking heavily and not working. Luke Cage has just got out of prison. And Rand, or the Iron Fist, is the only one who has continued his fight against evil.\n\nBut due to various circumstances, each of them has ended up at Hand HQ. So just when it looks like Rand, played by Finn Jones, is defeated, Luke Cage arrives, played with smouldering power by Mike Colter. After two episodes of small beer individual fighting and essential but not exactly kick-ass character development, this is what we have been waiting for. Showtime.\n\nOver a hip-hop soundtrack, Cage and Rand go to work. Cage throws a man into a wall. Rand kicks someone in the head. Men arrive with guns. They try to shoot our heroes. Rand ducks behind Cage, who soaks up the bullets. Teamwork!\n\nMeanwhile Jones, who has always been less earnest and more reluctant than the other three, is making her way to the battle with Murdock. He's wrapped a scarf over his face in an attempt to hide his real identity. \"You look like an asshole,\" she tells him.\n\nIt's been two-and-a-half years since Netflix first launched its own mini-Marvel universe. Daredevil was the first, with Charlie Cox playing the blind attorney with super hearing and spatial awareness. Jessica Jones, played by Krysten Ritter, followed in November 2015, Luke Cage arrived last September, and Iron Fist aired in March this year.\n\nIn January, in a basement under the Manhattan bridge in Chinatown, I got to meet the Defenders, just after they'd filmed a scene. Cox, clad in a dark suit, said he had been acutely aware of how long it was taking to achieve this four-hero mashup. \"When I signed a contract to do Daredevil,\" he said, \"I vaguely remember my agent saying, 'Eventually they're going to do the other three shows. And then there's going to be this team-up. And I just remember thinking, 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll see.'\"\n\nIt was Daredevil's decision to give up fighting and stick to the law that provides his first meeting with Jessica Jones. He is called to defend her in court. \"They're four people who don't tend to have many friends,\" Cox said. \"Initially they don't know each other. They don't trust each other. It's particularly difficult for Murdock because he has a secret identity.\"\n\nAfter the first three Marvel series received positive reviews, Netflix was widely seen to have stumbled with Iron Fist. They're hoping the Defenders represents a return to form. Sigourney Weaver plays Alexandra as an icy cool new villain - and the reappearance of secondary characters from each of the four original shows is likely to please fans.\n\nThe reason the Defenders have united is to fight Weaver's Alexandra - a wealthy New York magnate who is the head of a powerful organisation. Back in January, the parallels with Donald Trump's recent election victory and inauguration were obvious. When Ritter was asked about this, the matter was clearly too upsetting, even for Jessica Jones. \"I'm going to cry,\" was all she would say.\n\nBut Colter and Jones brought up the parallel themselves. \"The enemy we're dealing with isn't too dissimilar to the danger we're seeing going on in America right now. There's corruption and confusion in the world right now with our politics and the enemy we are fighting,\" said Jones. \"We're essentially defending society and morals,\" added Colter.\n\nThe Defenders is on Netflix from Friday.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds", "wgt": 100, "id": 1166, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Birds"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements", "wgt": 100, "id": 1196, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Movements"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217872"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303938", "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311156", "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311297", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313076", "label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "405520", "label": {"eng": "Secret identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

But the eight-episode team-up series will feature a lot more familiar faces than just Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist. It seems as if they will be bringing most of their supporting characters along for the ride as well.\n\nHere is a list of the characters from the other Marvel Netflix shows who will be showing up in The Defenders starting with Iron Fist. After choosing to side with Danny over The Hand at the end of Iron Fist, Colleen Wing will be back for all eight episodes of The Defenders.\n\nSeeing as it appears that one of the main villains for The Defenders is The Hand, it makes sense that Colleen will be back to fight the group she used to belong to. Colleen working with the Defenders also means she will once again face off against Madame Gao. Actress Wai Ching Ho is listed as being in four episodes according to IMDB.\n\nThe Hand also played a big role in the events of Daredevil season 2, so it also makes sense that other characters from that show including Madame Gao will make an appearance in The Defenders. Stick will be back for three episodes to likely give Matt and the other Defenders more information about The Hand.\n\nThis next character's return requires a spoiler warning, as it ruins a big plot point from the end of Daredevil season 2, even though it was in the trailer for The Defenders. Anyway, it turns out that Elektra is not quite as dead as Matt thinks she is. She has been brought back to life by The Hand. The question now is if she will be friend or foe to the Defenders.\n\nWith the Hand-related characters out of the way it is time to get to all of the other characters who will be popping up during this series, because it is basically everyone.\n\nFrom Daredevil, Foggy Nelson and Karen Page are back. Hopefully, this will provide some answers into how the latter is handling learning that Matt is Daredevil. As for Foggy, he is still working for Jeri Hogarth's firm. Hogarth herself will also be in three episodes of The Defenders.\n\nThat leads to Jessica Jones. From that series, Malcolm will be around. And of course Jessica needs her sister Trish Walker around. It seems that Trish will bond with Karen over how knowing Matt and Jessica puts them in danger.\n\nNext is Luke Cage. Misty Knight will be around for four episodes. Maybe this will be start of a major plot point from the comics: the relationship drama between Luke, Misty and Jessica. Of course there is an extra complication in the show from Luke's girlfriend from the end of his first season, Claire Temple.\n\nThe glue that connects all of the Marvel Netflix shows together, Claire Temple is a vital part of The Defenders as she is the one character who has popped up on every show so far.

He's been concentrating on his work as a lawyer, he's sleeping and not got bruises and cuts all over his body. He's making progress and he's dealing with the loss of Elektra. But I think what we learn is he's also living a lie, in the same way that he had been living a lie as Daredevil, he's been living a lie as not Daredevil. Part of his journey is going to be him coming to terms with that element of himself -- that alter ego is really a fundamental part of who he is.\"\n\nMike Colter: \"We wrap up Luke's incarceration stuff. He has to get his past behind him. I think he turns a page and he's not looking over his shoulder and thinking someone's going to knock on his door and take him back to prison. He has no reason to hide his identity anymore. He's got a new way about him and he has a love interest, Claire. He has a different perspective and I think he's going to be a lighter, more positive Luke Cage -- one who's more driven and confident.\"\n\nFinn Jones: \"Right now, we're shooting The Defenders and I don't even see Danny Rand as a superhero yet. And in Danny's mind, he's not a superhero yet and that's really wonderful to be able to play that arc because you get a real, fleshed-out character, someone who's relatable. Danny grows up through Iron Fist and he continues to pursue his purpose and drive throughout The Defenders. And to play it all as one is really great [because Iron Fist and The Defenders were filmed back-to-back]. But I tell you what, filming constantly for a year is f**king exhausting. It's a marathon.\"\n\nOn their character's dynamic within the Defenders:\n\nCox: \"Matt begins, reluctantly, to learn to have trust and make friends that share the same adversities he's grown up with. One of the things these series have was to show that having a super power isn't just an amazing gift and everyone loves it. In our world, it's something that's shameful at times and you feel lonely and alienated, like you're not part of the human race in the same way. It's a big step for Matt to find people he can really relate to and build trust and friendship with.\"\n\nColter: \"Luke knows where he falls and he knows when to step forward, when to step back, when to stay quiet and when to speak up. It's a delicate balance because all of the Defenders have a leadership quality about them so working together as one is a challenge because they're so used to doing everything on their own.\"\n\nJones: \"Danny is the youngest of the four so he brings a naivety, a recklessness and an optimism to the group which the others kind of admire but also condescend a little bit. We're all brought together out of a necessity to work together to take on the threat, and it's not a Power Rangers-esque thing. It's different to that, there's a lot friction but then within that, alliances start to form and it's real. It's what you would expect from four street-level superheroes coming together.\"\n\nOn the relationship between Luke Cage and Iron Fist, who has long-running friendship in the comics:\n\nColter: \"The Defenders explore the journey of how Luke and Danny became friends and some of the roots of their relationship. These guys have very different backgrounds. It's a very unusual pairing. It's like Luke and Jessica Jones -- how do those two opposites attract and work together? I think we'll see a little of that in The Defenders.\"\n\nJones: \"With me and Mike, it feels very natural. Those scenes are some of my favourite scenes in The Defenders because our energies complement each other really well, as people, as well as in the writing and in the characters. It's not like Luke and Danny are buddies straightaway, there's friction between us as there would be with two people from different backgrounds. What really draws Danny to Luke and maybe Luke to Danny are the vulnerabilities of both characters.\"\n\nOn whether Luke Cage and Jessica Jones are destined to be coupled off, like in the comics:\n\nColter: \"There's always a journey. Is there some endgame where Luke and Jessica will end up together? We don't know how this is all going to end up, how it's all going to play itself out. Along the journey, is Luke having a bit of fun? Maybe. It wasn't like Jessica was saying 'I want to be in a relationship with you', and even if she was, she did kill his wife so that's a little weird thing -- it takes time to get over that. But some fans don't know about the Jessica thing and we've already said it's bigger than the comic books so those fans might think, 'oh, well, Claire is more stable for him than Jessica'. But the dynamic is there and Jessica is there so we'll see how it all works.\"\n\nOn melding four distinct shows together:\n\nColter: \"All of our shows have different tones and our producers and directors have done a good job trying to mesh these worlds together. They're very aware that all the fans want to see the world of each character to be brought to this world. Even though it is New York City, it all feels a little different. Jessica's weird and cold world feels a little different to Luke's promising, colourful world and Daredevil's dark, edgy world. It's trying to meld those worlds together -- that's the biggest challenge.\n\nCox: \"Bringing four different shows together in a world that feels natural and coherent is a big task. Jessica Jones felt very different from Daredevil which I think felt very different from Luke Cage. The three felt very different but [the character of] Claire Temple [who crossed over in all four] made sense in all those shows, as did Hogarth and Foggy when they showed up. I think the answer lies in that. Although they feel different, there is a way where you merge these worlds where it feels like we're in the same universe.\"\n\nOn filming all-in action sequences with four superheroes:\n\nCox: \"We had a lot of team-up stuff going on and it's a lot more complicated because when I do a fight sequence [on Daredevil] and there's a portion I can't do, my stunt double Chris Brewster does it and you only have to position the camera to hide one person's face. But if we've got a big team-up and there's a section all of us can't do or two of us can't do because it's particularly complex, you have to find a way to position the camera and not show the stunt doubles.\"\n\nColter: \"I think some of the fight sequences are inventive because we're all using each other and stepping in to help. So it becomes a bit of a display of that. This is Daredevil's turn, this is Iron Fist's turn and this is Cage's turn. If you're in a fight and someone needs help, all of a sudden Jessica pops in. Everybody is helping everybody -- I think that's what's cool. The camera is constantly moving and the action is heightened and fast.\"\n\nOn working together as part of an ensemble instead of as the lead in their own show:\n\nCox: \"It's more complicated, at first it's difficult for us to just shut up because we're all actors and we all talk and get on as friends, and then you can see the production people are saying, 'guys you got to shut up, you got to start filming'.\"\n\nColter: \"At the beginning, you don't have to be here every day and you think the schedule is really great. But then you start to miss the consistency of the storyline and knowing exactly what's going on at all times because there are so many stories. You have to pay attention and focus on where everybody is.\"\n\nJones: \"Between all four of us working together, there are no egos and we're all team players. All the showrunners [of the individual series] have a say in The Defenders, so [The Defenders showrunner] Marco [Ramirez] and Marvel will look to [Iron Fist season one showrunner] Scott Buck. Scott will get the scripts for The Defenders as well and he will be able to make changes where he thinks it's relevant. As do I have a say in the show as well. It's a real collaboration.\"\n\nOn how The Defenders differ from The Avengers:\n\nColter: \"The Defenders are not people who are trying to be above society. We function best when people don't know who we are. At the beginning of The Defenders, we're all trying to not get involved because that's not what we do, we're not the intergalactic group of people travelling around looking for people to defeat. We're people who have a job, we pay rent and we have something that we're trying to do but we have a limit. And we don't have the budget for [aliens in the sky]. Everything happens below the clouds.\"\n\nCox: \"We also have much smaller scenes with just a couple of us sitting in a coffee shop and having a chat because we have much more time to fill. Often those are my favourite scenes to do because as an actor, that's where you can find the subtleties and nuances of what really makes these characters. The whole reason I think these shows have worked is because these characters have been written and performed humanely, like you should recognise yourself in these people.\"\n\nWhere to next?\n\nCox: \"I think whatever happens to these guys in this show is part of their journey going forward. It has to be the line remains linear -- it's not an isolated event. What happens in this show has to inform the other shows.\"\n\nJones: \"I'd really like a Heroes for Hire series [in the comic books, Luke Cage and Danny Rand have a business together called Heroes for Hire], maybe mixed with the Daughters of the Dragon. So a big ensemble with all five of us -- Danny, Luke, Colleen, Misty and Claire -- under the Heroes for Hire name. I think that would be a really nice idea, but it wouldn't be a while.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 100, "id": 7, "label": "dmoz/Arts"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 541, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "641252", "label": {"eng": "Elektra (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1288996", "label": {"eng": "Claire Temple"}}]}

None are happy about it.\n\nLuke Cage remarks that he doesn't need 'superfriends' and Jessica mocks Matt Murdock's Daredevil outfit.\n\nCast\n\nJessica Henwick (Colleen Wing) returns alongside Carrie-Anne Moss (Jeri Hogarth), Mercedes Kelly (Misty Knight) and Elden Henson (Fraser 'Foggy' Nelson).\n\nRosario Dawson will also be making an appearance, reprising her role as nurse Claire Temple.\n\nThe characters have already made appearances in the other Netflix Marvel series - Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage.\n\nReview - What we thought\n\nHaving watched the first four episodes of the new series it's clear that Netflix has again failed to heed the warnings from fans as well as critics and continued with the excruciatingly slow pacing.\n\nEpisodes one to three two did very little to keep my interest.\n\nThey're spent wrapping up loose plot points and finding forced excuses for each character to be in the same room together.\n\nIt's all stylishly shot, as lighting and production designers go nuts with colour coding every scene.\n\nDaredevil red, Luke Cage yellow, Jessica Jones purple, and Iron Fist green, in case you were wondering.\n\nDespite the show's best efforts Danny Rand doesn't become any more likeable and still suffers from the same traits that made his story so unbearably bland.\n\nWhat's worse is when placed alongside the others, he is neither funny, cool or bad-ass, instead he's stuck repeating, \"I'm the immortal Iron Fist, sworn protector of K'un Lun\" like a broken record.\n\nJessica Jones' quick wit helps cut through the stale dialogue and if it weren't for her the show would be too serious and dark.\n\nWeaver is great but lacks the grit Vincent D'Onofrio had in Daredevil and the menacing presence David Tennant brought to Jessica's Kilgrave.\n\nSo far she is just being used for exposition and I have the feeling we have yet to scratch the surface with her character.\n\nIn the few moments where our heroes do face off against evil, the action is beautiful raw.\n\nThe first four episodes make this series very difficult to judge what's coming next, so I'm willing to believe The Defenders is just a slow burner and we're in for an explosive second half.\n\nThere's a lot of potential for this to become a serious contender for Marvel and Netflix, they just need to take the team out of neutral and kick it up a gear.\n\nHow to watch The Defenders\n\nYou have to be on Netflix to watch the show, you can sign up here .", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100,

Honestly, just this little pep talk alone for The Defenders makes her one of the better villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Watch the trailer to see for yourself.\n\nWhile these superheroes must come together to defeat Alexandra Reid, the trailer reveals some moments where they're not getting along too well. Or maybe it's just Iron First, who has a problem with everybody since there's a moment where he punches Daredevil in the face and a quick shot where Luke Cage appears to be throwing a jab his way. We know these heroes aren't too keen on being a team at the start of this series, so maybe it's just the same growing pains that the Avengers went through when they first assembled in 2012.\n\nFor more from The Defenders, check out these clips fro the series featuring characters from their respective shows:", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 577, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages", "wgt": 100, "id": 610, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "wgt": 100, "id": 636, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trucking", "wgt": 100, "id": 696, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Trucking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 1010, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Recreational_Vehicles", "wgt": 100, "id": 1387, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Recreational Vehicles"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}]}

In addition to Daredevil, we have Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and soon, The Defenders, which will unite the heroes to fight a common enemy in New York City. The new series promises a team-up unlike anything we've seen so far, and actor Finn Jones has promised that the Netflix corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe won't be the same after all is said and done in The Defenders. Jones, who plays Danny Rand/Iron Fist, teased this about what's to come:\n\n[The Defenders] feels like the end of Phase One [and]the beginning of another phase. Let's just say there are certain events that happen at the end of The Defenders which are going to rock everyone's world. So people aren't going to be the same after the end of The Defenders.\n\nIt sounds like the Marvel Netflix shows are following the model of the larger MCU, which has been releasing movies in phases since way back in 2008. Phase 1 of the movies consists of Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avengers, and the team-up adventure that was The Avengers between 2008-2012. The timeframe from the Netflix series is significantly smaller, as Daredevil debuted in April 2015 and The Defenders is set to hit the web on August 2017. Finn Jones' comments to Digital Spy indicate that just as the Avengers were changed by the events of The Avengers, the Defenders will be changed by the events of The Defenders.\n\nFor the sake of our heroes, I hope Phase 2 of the Netflix shows doesn't follow the pattern of the MCU's Phase 2 exactly, given that Phase 2 started with a traumatized Tony Stark in Iron Man 3, revealed a S.H.I.E.L.D. that had been infiltrated by Hydra in Captain America: The Civil War, and unleashed Ultron on the world in The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Fortunately, we do have some details about Phase 2 on Netflix.\n\nThe next phase will kick off later this year with the first season of The Punisher, which will showcase Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle in a solo series, after he made his unforgettable first appearance in Daredevil Season 2. Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist have all been renewed as well, so we'll see more of them after The Defenders. Claire Temple will probably find herself interacting with the heroes yet again in Phase 2 as well, because poor Claire just can't catch a break from all the super-weirdness New York City has to offer.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see if The Defenders is as much of a hit for the small screen as The Avengers was on the big screen. Luckily, we don't have too much longer to wait. The Defenders will become available for our streaming pleasure on Friday, August 18 at 12:01 a.m. PT on Netflix.

Netflix, as it's grown to become more and more of a major player in the modern TV universe, has grand plans of its own.\n\nNetflix started out, and took root and blossomed, by providing easy access to many of the movies and TV shows made by others. Then it began making its own TV series and movies. As those programs have succeeded wildly (starting with House of Cards) Netflix has gone all in on the original production front, to the point where it's now carpet-bombing Netflix subscribers with several new offerings a week.\n\nMeanwhile, other entertainment companies, such as CBS and Disney, are getting into the streaming business with their own services, and beginning to withhold their product from Netflix and other distributors.\n\nThat's why original programs are so important to the future of Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other such companies. It's also why Netflix, most aggressively, is making new series deals with David Letterman and current ABC producer superstar Shonda Rhimes -- and why it partnered with Marvel Comics so boldly, and with such long-range commitment, years ago.\n\nNetflix's plan with Marvel, from the start, was to take relatively minor or underused titles and heroes from the Marvel comic books, and star them in their own season-long TV series. Then, after that, to feature them together in The Defenders, in an all-star superhero team-up.\n\nMarvel used the same blueprint (with bigger heroes) in the movies, first launching Iron Man, Captain America and others, then showcasing them together as The Avengers. And Marvel's rivals at DC Comics did the same with Batman, Superman and, most recently, Wonder Woman, while planning a one-movie-fits-all Justice League adventure film.\n\nOn Netflix, Krysten Ritter, who played the doomed junkie in Breaking Bad, came first, starring in, and as, Jessica Jones. Then came Charlie Cox as Daredevil, the most familiar of this batch of heroes, and the only one to get two seasons of his own show. Then Mike Colter as Luke Cage, followed by Finn Jones as The Iron Fist.\n\nAll of them ended up in the same Hell's Kitchen turf in New York, but dramatically, not all these characters, or shows, were created equal. Jessica Jones and Daredevil were wonderful fantasy dramas about haunted heroes. Jessica had post-traumatic stress after being captured and manipulated by a mind-controlling villain. And Cox's Matt Murdock, the lawyer by day, and costumed Daredevil by night, was blind, with his remaining senses exponentially enhanced after childhood exposure to radiation.\n\nThese two shows had strong supporting casts and terrific villains, played by such actors as David Tennant and Vincent D'Onofrio.

The Iron Fist star explained that the eight-episode show - which brings together his character, Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Luke Cage - will launch Phase Two of their narratives.\n\nJones also hinted that Phase Two could see Iron Fist and Luke Cage - played by Mike Colter - re-teaming in each other's separate shows, a pairing that fans will enjoy as they had whole comic book series centred on their teaming called Power Man and Iron Fist, published in 1972 and revived in 2011 for a five-issue limited series, and later under the Heroes for Hire banner launched in 1996. The British actor told Digital Spy:\n\n\"Let's just say there are certain events that happen at the end of The Defenders which are going to rock everyone's world. So people aren't going to be the same after the end of The Defenders [...] Me and Mike get on really well, we have a natural good chemistry. The way that Marco's written Danny and Luke is really clever - it's not on the nose, and it feels relevant. The pairing feels relevant, which I think is the most important thing.\"\n\nPhase One of the Marvel/Netflix Universe has established our heroes and led them towards a climactic team battle with The Hand, as well as the new, more powerful adversary in Sigourney Weaver's Alexandra. Deborah Ann Woll, who plays Karen Page, told Screen Rant that viewers should consider The Defenders more like a \"one-off show\" than series as it's about the heroes \"solving one big problem.\"\n\n\"I think it's also good to remember that Defenders, because we're bringing everybody together, it's a little bit of a one-off, for lack of a better word. It's going to kind of come together, solve this one big problem, and then you know we all have to go back to our own shows.\"\n\nThat should mean that the main narrative arc that has linked all four superhero shows together should come to a climax in The Defenders to allow brand new storylines for each individual series to focus on, as well as introduce new characters. Ghost Rider, Blade and even Black Widow are just a few superhero names that have been suggested for Netflix's Marvel Universe, but hopefully it won't be the end of seeing Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Daredevil fighting onscreen together. It also suggests that Jon Bernthal's The Punisher season 1 is part of Phase Two along with Jessica Jones season 2, Daredevil season 3, Luke Cage season 2 and Iron Fist season 2, so it's anyone's guess as to what Frank Castle will be up against when is show airs later this year.\n\nMORE: 15 Times Iron Fist Did Something Awesome\n\nThe Defenders will be available on Netflix August 18, 2017.\n\nSource: Digital Spy\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

Netflix, as it's grown to become more and more of a major player in the modern TV universe, has grand plans of its own.\n\nNetflix started out, and took root and blossomed, by providing easy access to many of the movies and TV shows made by others. Then it began making its own TV series and movies. As those programs have succeeded wildly (starting with House of Cards) Netflix has gone all in on the original production front, to the point where it's now carpet-bombing Netflix subscribers with several new offerings a week.\n\nMeanwhile, other entertainment companies, such as CBS and Disney, are getting into the streaming business with their own services, and beginning to withhold their product from Netflix and other distributors.\n\nThat's why original programs are so important to the future of Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other such companies. It's also why Netflix, most aggressively, is making new series deals with David Letterman and current ABC producer superstar Shonda Rhimes -- and why it partnered with Marvel Comics so boldly, and with such long-range commitment, years ago.\n\nNetflix's plan with Marvel, from the start, was to take relatively minor or underused titles and heroes from the Marvel comic books, and star them in their own season-long TV series. Then, after that, to feature them together in The Defenders, in an all-star superhero team-up.\n\nMarvel used the same blueprint (with bigger heroes) in the movies, first launching Iron Man, Captain America and others, then showcasing them together as The Avengers. And Marvel's rivals at DC Comics did the same with Batman, Superman and, most recently, Wonder Woman, while planning a one-movie-fits-all Justice League adventure film.\n\nOn Netflix, Krysten Ritter, who played the doomed junkie in Breaking Bad, came first, starring in, and as, Jessica Jones. Then came Charlie Cox as Daredevil, the most familiar of this batch of heroes, and the only one to get two seasons of his own show. Then Mike Colter as Luke Cage, followed by Finn Jones as The Iron Fist.\n\nAll of them ended up in the same Hell's Kitchen turf in New York, but dramatically, not all these characters, or shows, were created equal. Jessica Jones and Daredevil were wonderful fantasy dramas about haunted heroes. Jessica had post-traumatic stress after being captured and manipulated by a mind-controlling villain. And Cox's Matt Murdock, the lawyer by day, and costumed Daredevil by night, was blind, with his remaining senses exponentially enhanced after childhood exposure to radiation.\n\nThese two shows had strong supporting casts and terrific villains, played by such actors as David Tennant and Vincent D'Onofrio. But compared to them, Luke Cage was minor-league, and Iron Fist a total washout. Gathered together under one new title, if these Defenders were Marx Brothers, Iron Fist would be Zeppo.\n\nBut The Defenders works, in part, precisely because the chemistry among characters doesn't, and because it's a group of loners who don't even decide to join forces until four episodes in. And those were all the episodes provided for preview, so I'm not sure where The Defenders is going.\n\nBut I know it starts well, by bringing back the strongest supporting characters and continuing plots from the previous Marvel Netflix shows, and by casting Sigourney Weaver as the new big, bad villain.\n\nThe real standouts in The Defenders are the same actors and characters who excelled in their own series: Ritter as Jessica Jones and Cox as Daredevil.

It's called \"The Defenders.\" And it's a small screen teeming of superheroes that's been part of Netflix's programming plan since 2015. Our TV critic David Bianculli has this review.\n\nDAVID BIANCULLI, BYLINE: The villains in comic books usually have grandiose master plans to target and defeat an enemy or rule the world. Netflix, as it's grown to become more and more of a major player in the modern TV universe, has grand plans of its own. It started out and took root and blossomed by providing easy access to many of the movies and TV shows made by others. Then it started making its own TV series and movies.\n\nAnd as that has succeeded wildly, starting with \"House Of Cards,\" Netflix has gone all in on the original production front to the point where it's now carpet bombing Netflix subscribers with several new offerings a week. Meanwhile, other entertainment companies, such as CBS and Disney, are getting into the streaming business with their own services and beginning to withhold their product from Netflix and other distributors.\n\nThat's why original programs are so important to the future of Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other such companies. It's also why Netflix, most aggressively, is making new series deals with David Letterman and current ABC producer superstar Shonda Rhimes and why it partnered with Marvel Comics so boldly and with such long-range commitment years ago. Netflix's plan with Marvel from the start was to take relatively minor or underused titles and heroes from the Marvel comic books and star them in their own season-long TV series, then after that, to feature them together in \"The Defenders\" in an all-star superhero team up.\n\nIn the movies, it's the same blueprint with bigger heroes Marvel used to launch \"Iron Man,\" \"Captain America\" and others, then showcased them together as \"The Avengers\" and how its rivals at DC Comics did the same with \"Batman,\" \"Superman\" and most recently \"Wonder Woman,\" while planning a one-movie-fits-all \"Justice League\" adventure film. On Netflix, Krysten Ritter, who played the doom junkie in \"Breaking Bad,\" came first starring in and as \"Jessica Jones.\" Then came Charlie Cox as Daredevil, the most familiar of this batch of heroes and the only one to get two seasons of his own show. Then Mike Colter as Luke Cage followed by Finn Jones as the Iron Fist. All of them ended up in the same Hell's Kitchen turf in New York. But dramatically, not all these characters or shows were created equal.\n\n\"Jessica Jones\" and \"Daredevil\" were wonderful fantasy dramas about haunted heroes. Jessica had post-traumatic stress after being captured and manipulated by a mind-controlling villain and Matt Murdock, the lawyer by day and costumed Daredevil by night, was blind with his remaining senses exponentially enhanced after childhood exposure to radiation. These two shows had strong supporting casts and terrific villains, played by such actors as David Tennant and Vincent D'Onofrio. But compared to them, \"Luke Cage\" was minor league and \"Iron Fist\" a total wash out.\n\nGathered together under one new title, if these defenders were Marx Brothers, Iron Fist would be Zeppo. But \"The Defenders\" works in part precisely because the chemistry among characters doesn't and because it's a group of loners that doesn't even decide to join forces until four episodes in. And those were all the episodes provided for preview, so I'm not sure where \"The Defenders\" is going. But I know it starts well by bringing back the strongest supporting characters and continuing plots from the previous Marvel Netflix shows and by casting Sigourney Weaver as the new big, bad villain. Early on, her character, a wealthy woman named Alexandra obsessed with achieving immortality, captures Stick, a character played by Scott Glenn who has individually trained more than one of the other characters. He's tough, but she seems even tougher.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE DEFENDERS\")\n\nSIGOURNEY WEAVER: (As Alexandra) Everyone else on your side is dead. You know who I am, I know who you are. So let's skip the wartime banter. Time is not something I can afford to waste. Not for your benefit but for mine, I'm taking the blinds off. Try not to bite, old friend. It's undignified.\n\nSCOTT GLENN: (As Stick) Alexandra.\n\nWEAVER: (As Alexandra) Stick, we have so much to talk about.\n\nBIANCULLI: The real standouts in \"The Defenders\" are the same actors and characters who excelled in their own series, Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones and Charlie Cox as Daredevil. When they finally meet, the results are electric. And then there's Elektra, an important character in this new series, even though she died at the end of last season on \"Daredevil.\"\n\nBut figuring out who lives and dies is a tricky thing in superhero stories and in the real-life battle for world TV domination. With \"The Defenders,\" Netflix is making another very bold, very smart move.\n\nDAVIES: David Bianculli teaches TV and film at Rowan University and is the author of \"The Platinum Age Of Television: From I Love Lucy To The Walking Dead, How TV Became Terrific.\" He reviewed Netflix's new Marvel Comics series \"The Defenders.\" Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, performer Bridget Everett.

Or would you find yourself lost in a world of magic chi, Harlem heroes and Purple Men?\n\nWe put this question to series showrunner Marco Ramirez, and he acknowledged the difficulties posed by the mass of backstory - but added that he believes the show will function just as well for newcomers as dyed-in-the-spandex fans.\n\n\"By design, we just had to make something that did five different things,\" Ramirez said.\n\nKrysten Ritter, Finn Jones, Charlie Cox and Mike Colter in The Defenders\n\n\"We had to make a show that was for the viewer who had only seen Daredevil. We had to make a show for the viewer who had only seen Jessica Jones, who had only seen Luke, who had only seen Iron Fist. And for the viewer where Defenders is the first thing they're ever gonna see.\n\n\"There are viewers who will have seen two of the shows and none of the others, or three, or none! And so for that, the thing had to work for everyone. It had to be this universal adaptor plug-in thing.\"\n\nAccordingly, Ramirez looked for inspiration in a model that had proven to work for assembling disparate superheroes - the Avengers film franchise, which shares a universe with Marvel's Netflix series (though no characters have crossed over onscreen as of yet).\n\n\"The [first] Avengers movie works even if you've never seen a single one of those movies,\" Ramirez explained.\n\n\"'Oh that's flying god guy? Oh that's rich guy with the super suit? OK cool, I'm putting that all together.' You kind of can get it.\"\n\nBut of course, the series also had to cater to fans who HAD watched every single minute of every Netflix/Marvel series to date, meaning Ramirez and his team were forced to walk a delicate tightrope in the writers' room.\n\n\"Because Netflix has all the data of how many people have watched what show, they were like 'we need a show that won't bore the audience who's already seen all of Daredevil,\" he told me.\n\n\"We don't want to over-explain Daredevil lore. We also don't want to under-explain it.'\n\n\"So it was a delicate tightrope to walk. It's one of the thankless parts of this job and that endeavour, how delicate that was to walk the line between exposition, so you've got just enough that you can know it, even if you haven't seen any of these shows, bordered with not over-explaining it in case you had seen it, so you wouldn't be like 'why are they re-explaining Jessica Jones' backstory to me, I know.'\n\n\"It's kind of a run-and-gun thing where you kind of only get everything you need to know to understand this story. And if you're intrigued, and want to know more about who the heck Luke is and where he comes from, and you haven't seen Luke, I imagine you're going to want to go back and watch it.\"\n\nElodie Yung as Elektra and Sigourney Weaver as Alexandra in Marvel's The Defenders\n\nI give Ramirez an example of a moment in an early episode that struck me as particularly impenetrable for new viewers - the reveal of a character captured by Sigourney Weaver's villain Alexandra, whose imprisonment will only be significant to anyone who's watched Daredevil - but he disagreed that such moments will necessarily leave viewers confused.\n\n\"There are a couple of things like that where we're like 'Well, if you don't know who it is, is it going to matter?'\" Ramirez said.\" And similarly with [resurrected friend-turned-foe] Elektra - if you don't know who that is, is it going to matter?\n\n\"But in some cases, visually, if I hadn't watched Daredevil and suddenly Sigourney Weaver takes the mask off this guy, I'd still be like, 'who the f*** is that guy??'\n\n\"Similarly with Elektra, if you don't know who Elodie Yung plays on the show, and this woman just shows up in this beautiful black trenchcoat and does all this awesome s*** with two swords, like, you're still going to maybe care! Even if you don't know 'oh that's Elektra' it's going to be like, 'who's the chick in the black coat?'\n\n\"Every time it was a Rubik's cube. It was like OK now, pretend I don't know any of Jessica Jones' backstory, right? So if anyone mentions 'I know the man who abused you long ago' and I didn't watch JJ, how am I going to know that's impactful? How am I going to know that's an insult?\n\n\"So it was always like, OK make sure if you mention something about Luke's past in one scene, make sure the audience who might not know what that is also understands at least what the impact is. So there's a lot of that.\"\n\nFans and newcomers alike will get to decide whether Ramirez kept steady on that tightrope when the series is released on Netflix this Friday- but if you'd rather be fully clued up, check out our brief summary of where we left the characters last in their individual series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel's The Defenders streams on Netflix from Friday 18th August\n\nTags Drama Charlie Cox Krysten Ritter Mike Colter Sigourney Weaver Marvel's The Defenders Huw Fullerton\n\nSci-Fi Editor, film fan and resident Game of Thrones addict at RadioTimes.com\n\nFollow Huw", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 100, "id": 552, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Jewelry", "wgt": 100, "id": 553, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Jewelry"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "386870", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

After it premiered, the reviews did not get any better, although there have been people who have taken to social media to share their appreciation for the fourth solo Marvel superhero adventure on Netflix. Finn Jones, who stars as the titular hero, Iron Fist/Danny Rand, has defended the show since before it aired and now as the four-hero team up, The Defenders, gets ready to begin streaming, the actor is still talking about the fans' appreciation for his solo series.\n\nAccording to Gadgets 360, when one asks Finn Jones about the reception for Iron Fist, all he has to say is good things. While speaking to reporters, Jones said that his series was actually quite well received, no matter what the critics have said. The actor shared that every person he has met at comic conventions, out on the streets, and just in life, in general, have told him that they loved the series and his portrayal of the Iron Fist. Finn Jones did say that he understands that there has been a lot of talking on the internet about Iron Fist, but he does not feel that this really reflects the \"reality\" of the situation.\n\nThe actor said that while he was at Comic-Con in London he had hundreds of people that came up to him to talk about the show. For many of these fans, they wanted him to know that it did not matter what the critics were saying, or what was said online, they really enjoyed the series. Finn Jones said these people really loved Iron Fist and all of its characters, and he felt that they truly understood where the show was coming from.\n\nWith Iron Fist joining forces with the rest of the street-level Marvel superheroes in The Defenders, it makes sense that Finn Jones is talking about the reception for his own show, especially with talk about how each of the characters will be changed by their team up. Jones has shared that his character will definitely be \"checked\" by the other members of the team, and this will ultimately be a good thing.\n\nFinn Jones said that getting checked by people like Luke Cage and Daredevil's mentor, Stick, will actually help Danny to become a more \"grounded and responsible superhero.\" The actor explained that Season 1 of both Iron Fist and The Defenders was just the first part of his character's journey and everything is happening for a reason. As long as fans stay patient they will get to see as Danny Rand grows as a character, and really works at becoming the Iron Fist that people have been waiting for.\n\nAudiences will get to see more of Danny Rand's journey as the Iron Fist when The Defenders begins streaming on August 18. While Finn Jones has already indicated that this is just the beginning of his character's story, it sounds as if the team-up will help to set the stage for Danny to grow and become the hero that everyone needs him to be.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Metal_Craft", "wgt": 100, "id": 1242, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Metal Craft"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311297", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}]}

For the Marvel shows on Netflix, including The Defenders, it's not quite so simple.\n\nFor starters, The Defenders is really the end of what fans were promised when the two companies initially teamed up. All we knew for sure we were getting was one season each of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage, as well as a Defenders mini-series. Come Friday, we'll have had all of that delivered to us, plus a second season of Daredevil to boot.\n\nStill, considering that new seasons of each individual series have already been announced, it's clear the Netflix corner of the MCU is going to push forward, and the demand is certainly there (except for Iron Fist season 2, perhaps, but we still have faith in Danny).\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that Finn Jones, who plays Danny Rand, recently told Digital Spy that The Defenders feels like it closes out one chapter and starts another.\n\n\"Let's just say there are certain events that happen at the end of The Defenders which are going to rock everyone's world. So people aren't going to be the same after the end of The Defenders.\"\n\nJones also specifically used the phrase, \"the beginning of another phase,\" which definitely is language with which MCU fans are familiar.\n\nWant another piece of evidence in favor of a \"Marvel Netflix Phase 2,\" even if it's not officially referred to as such? The Punisher will arrive later this year, and Frank Castle wasn't even part of the original plan.\n\nWhether it was always planned this way or not, The Defenders feels like a perfect point to draw a line between what's come before and what awaits down the road.

But in the case of The Defenders, Netflix and Marvel's new team-up crossover superhero series, cracking into the very first 1972 comic issue isn't actually going to help you all that much. That's because the Marvel comics history of the Defenders is completely different than what you'd expect from the Netflix adaptation -- but thanks to modern comic writers like Brian Michael Bendis, it's started to look a little more like the TV version in recent years.\n\nFirst created by Roy Thomas, the original Defenders line-up didn't feature any of street-level characters that Netflix does, mostly because Daredevil was the only one who actually existed at the time. Instead, the very first Defenders were Dr. Strange, The Hulk, Namor The Submariner (he's sort of like Marvel's version of Aquaman, except he technically came first) and, later, the Silver Surfer from Fantastic Four. Although these characters had previously teamed up in their own crossovers, their first official outing as a team appeared in 1971 as part of Marvel Feature Issue #1, a showcase series that told stories from all over the Marvel Universe.\n\nAccording to an interview Thomas gave in Back Issue! Magazine, the name of the team was probably coined by Stan Lee. \"The 'Defenders' is far too passive a name for my taste,\" he admitted. \"I prefer more aggressive-sounding names like the 'Avengers' or the 'Invaders,' so Stan probably came up with that one.\" In the context of the comic book, though, it was all Dr. Strange's idea. He's basically to the Defenders what Nick Fury was to the movie version of the Avengers.\n\nThe Defenders hung around in Marvel Feature for a while until getting their own title in 1972; in later issues they welcomed Valkyrie to the group, an Asgardian who's being played by Tessa Thompson in Thor: Ragnarok, and another minor character named Nighthawk. The rest of the team were not fans of this idea at first.\n\nDespite not getting along all that well and being much less popular than the Avengers, they chugged along through the '70s and '80s with a reputation for being kind of weird. The team also added members here and there constantly, like Hellcat (the character that Netflix's Trish Walker is based on), Hawkeye, and Luke Cage, who was going by Power Man at the time. Heck, even Iron First got to be a \"Defender for a day\" in one story-arc.\n\nEventually writer J.M. DeMattis, who took over the series starting with issue #92, got burnt out and decided to replace almost everyone on the team in 1983. The \"New Defenders\" consisted of Valkyrie, a character created just for The Defenders named Gargoyle, a villain-turned hero known as Moondragon, and Beast, Iceman, and Angel from The X-Men.\n\nUnfortunately, the shake-up ended up spelling doom for The Defenders, which was cancelled in 1986 with half of its members disintegrated. According to then-writer Peter Gillis in Back Issue, he was told to kill everybody off so all the surviving X-Men characters could appear in X-Factor instead. That, kids, is why you don't trust mutants. Or comic book editors.\n\nMarvel eventually sought fit to bring the original team of Dr. Strange, Namor and the Hulk together in a 1990 crossover story, but didn't publish a new Defenders title until a few years later; called the Secret Defenders, it almost always consisted of different members and disbanded at the end of every mission. It was cancelled pretty soon after in 1995, and since then there've been several attempts to reboot or remake the team, including 2005's Defenders, 2009's The Last Defenders (which faced a villain team called The Offenders), writer Matt Fraction's Defenders in 2011 (which actually did have Iron Fist as a member), and an all-female team called The Fearless Defenders in 2013.\n\nAt this point, you're probably wondering: why did Netflix go with Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage when it announced its Defenders series back in 2013, since none of them were ever really associated very strongly with the team? I suspect that part of it has to do with what the Defenders represent as a group. When Namor, Dr. Strange and the Hulk first started saving the world together, they saw themselves more as individuals occasionally sharing a common goal. Being a quote-unquote \"team\" was for the Avengers.\n\nOf course, there's also the fact that Daredevil, Jessica, Iron Fist and Luke were in a team together once: Brian Michael Bendis' The New Avengers, which first began in 2005 and featured a splinter group of the Avengers. Of course, \"The New Avengers\" would be a really confusing team name to get MCU fans on board for, so it makes sense that Netflix would choose to go for another group name instead.\n\nBut although they were never Defenders together before 2017, they definitely are now. As first reported by The Hollywood Reporter in January, Marvel Comics has launched a brand new street-level comic of The Defenders that includes the Netflix line-up, and is currently being written by Brian Michael Bendis (who, fun fact, also created Jessica Jones for the comic book Alias in 2001). Naturally, the comic book versions of these characters are a little different than their TV counterparts -- for example, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage are married with a small child, who they may or may not have named \"Danielle\" after Iron Fist.\n\nAccording to what Brian Michael Bendis told Comic Book Resources, this new version of The Defenders was always part of the plan even before the series started, even though he wasn't originally going to call them that. \"I literally pitched this to the public on my last page of New Avengers -- a page of Luke and Jessica talking about this book,\" he said. \"It was always on my list of, 'This is what I want to do if I return to these characters.\"\n\nThe art also seems very much inspired by the Netflix series if you ask me. Just look at all those saturated colors!\n\nSo there you have it; unless you're dying to know more about Namor (and why wouldn't you be, honestly?), you're not going to need any more background reading to understand what's happening in The Defenders. Although, if you haven't seen the previous Netflix Marvel series -- especially Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage -- then you probably should do that first.

The online streaming giant's deal with Marvel TV to develop a corner of the greater MCU with multiple series about street-level heroes has proven for the most part popular and successful. And before the month is out Netflix will be unleashing its answer to the \"Avengers\" films by putting together Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist in \"#The Defenders.\" And just so you don't forget, they even put up one final trailer for fans to enjoy.\n\nIt has already been established by the past Marvel Netflix solo-hero series that something rotten is festering on the streets of New York City, under the noses of the more super of heroes like the Avengers. \"The Defenders\" brings all these backstory developments to a head, serving as the backdrop for which a motley crew of vigilantes will team up. A blind lawyer with enhanced senses and ninja training, a super-strong and super emotionally-scarred private eye, a brawling bartender with unbreakable skin, and a long-lost corporate heir with a chi-empowered punch must get to the bottom of a conspiracy involving the Hand cult.\n\nA blind lawyer with enhanced senses and ninja training, a super-strong and super emotionally-scarred private eye, a brawling bartender with unbreakable skin, and a long-lost corporate heir with a chi-empowered punch must get to the bottom of a conspiracy involving the Hand cult.\n\nThe last trailer sets the mood for what the individual heroes will be up against. It is framed with the four heroes in question: Matt Murdock/Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Danny Rand/Iron Fist (Finn Jones) eating at a Chinese restaurant. A quick glance shows that they just got out of a messy battle, shown in snippets along the scene. They are then interrupted by Matt's old master Stick (Scott Glenn) who tells them about a battle for the fate of New York City.\n\nPast trailers and articles pertaining to \"The Defenders\" on Netflix seem to portray a two-front assault on New York and its resident street vigilantes. A public figure known only as Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver) is systematically destroying fixtures in the lives of Matt, Jess, Luke and Danny. In the shadows however, Daredevil and Iron Fist's common enemy the Hand is on the verge of a rampage. They are led by their dark messianic figure in the resurrected and now-evil Elektra Natchios (Elodie Yung), Matt's old flame.\n\nAided by their respective allies, the foursome must join as a team-but-not in order to save their home from doom.\n\nIn the shadows, however, Daredevil and Iron Fist's common enemy the Hand is on the verge of a rampage.

That's a nice rating in its own right, and sits well alongside the rest of the Marvel Netflix shows, which have each earned the following scores on the aggregate site:\n\nDaredevil Season 1 - 98% Jessica Jones - 92% Daredevil Season 2 - 74% Luke Cage - 96% Iron Fist - 17%\n\nSo, while The Defenders may not be the hit that the solo debuts of Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage were (according to critics), it would seem to be a better exploration of the deeper mythology of The Hand, The Chaste, and K'un-Lun than either Daredevil season 2 or Iron Fist were.\n\nRead on for what Critics are saying about The Defenders - starting with Comicbook.com's Jamie Lovett!\n\nPreviousSlide 1/2Next Comicbook.com Reviews The Defenders\n\nAccording to our official Defenders Review:\n\n\"Marvel's The Defenders does an admirable of giving fans what they want by drawing its heroes together, without treating the alliance like fan service. The Defenders team has a distinct purpose, and each character's narrative is given the time, space, and respect it deserves. That modicum of restraint makes the heroes' time together feel that much more exciting, and even with the methodical pacing, there's no shortage of humor and action to be had.\"\n\nIn Kofi Outlaw's feature on why The Defenders fulfills the true potential of the MCU, he states:\n\n\"The Defenders succeeds at bringing its four respective Marvel Netflix series together, but it also succeeds in reminding us what is cool about each individual series and their respective heroes. Viewers will admire how the crossover actually takes time to pick up where each show left off, and slowly weave them into a big crossover event.\"\n\nPreviousSlide 2/2What Other Critics Are Saying\n\nHere's what some other industry critics are saying about The Defenders:\n\nEW - \"The Defenders is a lively genre entertainment that recharges your interest in Marvel pop. It presents as a big event, yet values consolidation.

And while \"The Defenders\" is occasionally a bit blander than an endeavor featuring deadly ninjas and elaborate costumes should be, the eight-part drama has notable selling points, chief among them an elegant and fierce performance from Sigourney Weaver.\n\nWeaver plays a criminal mastermind, and she sinks her teeth into the role with glee, but throughout the first four installments of \"The Defenders,\" her work remains measured and her wily charm carefully deployed. The drama's blocky dialogue is often unexceptional and sometimes borders on the unfortunate (\"It's too late for heroes!\"). But Weaver has an almost supernatural ability to make her scenes crackle with electricity, no matter how predictable her character's dastardly schemes.\n\nGetting a genuine movie star to make a TV series was a coup for Marvel, and \"The Defenders\" is generally smart about how it uses Weaver's ability to combine silky, intelligent charisma with intense tenacity. Her character, Alexandra, is believable as an accomplished New York City power player and also as someone much more malevolent than she first appears.\n\nEven if viewers haven't seen any of the other Marvel-Netflix shows, \"The Defenders\" will bring them up to speed, an exposition-heavy process that can sometimes give the proceedings a rote feel. Each superhero's core traits are reinforced in separate storylines in the first few episodes, and many characters from each show's supporting cast also put in appearances, which packs the drama with a crowded array of faces. But the fact that \"The Defenders,\" at least in the early going, switches frequently among its lead characters gives it a pleasing sense of momentum, a quality that can be difficult to find in the opening hours of other Marvel (or Netflix) drama series. There are also exciting fight scenes, and the return of Elodie Yung to the Marvel TV universe is welcome indeed; her mystery character in \"The Defenders\" has a desperate, melancholy persona and, of course, a lethal edge.\n\nFinn Jones, who plays rich guy Danny Rand, aka the Iron Fist, remains the Achilles' heel of the Marvel-Netflix empire. Not only does Jones lack the presence or skill to create interest in Rand's dilemmas, but the character's dumb choices make it even more difficult to care about anything he attempts. Given Rand's superficial, trust-fund kid vibe, it's tedious to hear him talking about his chi, and it's semi-comical when he intones the phrase \"I am the Immortal Iron Fist.\" \"The Defenders,\" however, has some awareness of how annoying Danny can be, and a portion of the comedy involving the character is intentional. Most other characters don't take him seriously, and more than once, the intensely pragmatic Luke Cage (Mike Colter) looks like he wants to put Rand through a wall. Still, even if Danny is exasperating, at least his naive, one-dimensional character does not unduly dominate the proceedings.\n\nThe other members of the core cast -- Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock/Daredevil, Krysten Ritter as tough private detective Jessica Jones and Colter as the bulletproof Cage -- are quite capable, and Scott Glenn, Jessica Henwick and Simone Missick are notably engaging in their supporting roles. As the Defenders alliance comes together, the superheroes exhibit a sense of self-awareness about their plans and their powerful enemies, and now and then they toss out a sarcastic remark or a well-timed bon mot. Colter, Weaver, Glenn and Ritter are particularly gifted with one-liners and perfectly calibrated glares, and Cox makes Murdock's pent-up Catholic guilt highly watchable.\n\nOne could wish for a little more diverting lightness. But now and then there's a sense that \"The Defenders\" is dutifully checking boxes rather than having a blast running around with men and women who enjoy donning form-fitting leather and slicing up their enemies. \"The Defenders\" is recognizably a superhero team-up, but like some tentpole films, it's also a careful piece of IP synergy. Still, if it lacks a bit of magic, at least, at least it's not a heavy summer commitment. Our heroes have only eight episodes to save the Big Apple, after which they'll return to their respective places on the Marvel release schedule.

It's been a long road, but if the first four episodes are anything to go by, then Marvel's The Defenders was well worth the wait.\n\nThe Defenders unites the eponymous heroes of Marvel's four Netflix shows to date - Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Michael Colter), and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) - and picks up where each hero's individual story where it left off. Matt Murdock is trying to leave his life as Daredevil behind, after having a falling out with best friend Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) and revealing himself to romantic interest Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll). Jessica still hasn't taken on a new case and is trying to come to terms with her new reputation as a hero. Luke returns to Harlem following a second trip to prison. Danny Rand also returns home after The Hand's trail leads him back to New York City.\n\nThe first episode and the majority of the second play out like the new episodes of four different television series edited together, with each hero pursuing their own individual narrative. The pacing is deliberately methodical, as the heroes frequently interact with members of each other's supporting cast. These frequent mini-crossovers can feel overly convenient in some instances, but help to build excitement and tension to create a larger narrative web, so that when The Defenders do finally meet it feels like they've been drawn together by a greater destiny, rather than stumbling upon each other by narrative contrivance.\n\nPreviousSlide 1/2Next Crossing Over\n\nOnce the heroes do begin to cross paths (first pairing up and then quickly coming together as a whole), the series reaches a new level of excitement, as the heroes immediately have great chemistry, with their personalities complementing each other well. Jessica Jones's acerbic wit plays perfect against Matt Murdock's stoicism, while Luke Cage's calm wisdom helps ground Danny's flighty and over-dramatic personality.\n\nThese compliments spill over into the action as well. While they don't start off on the best terms, the most anticipated first team up between the Power Man and Iron Fist puts the fight scenes of Marvel's Iron Fist to shame, and the character finally has a shining moment to put his actual Iron Fist to good use, for something other than knocking down a door. The \"major fight scene in a hallway\" trope that has appeared in most of the Marvel Netflix series so far also has its moment, but hardly feels like a retread when the entire Defenders group is working together in concert.\n\nThe feeling of four distinct narratives coming together is cemented by the show's cinematography and lighting. As each character progresses through their individual narratives through the first two episodes, their lives are lit up in the signature shade of their own series - a vibrant red for Daredevil, deep purple for Jessica Jones, bright yellow for Luke Cage, and emerald green for Iron Fist - and when the first tremors of the threat that will bring the team together are felt, the colors come crashing together to visually punctuate the moment.\n\nAs the heroes begin to cross paths, these colors begin to appear side by side until the all four are used in the design of the Golden Dragon, the Chinese restaurant where the Defenders share their first meal. When viewed at a wide angle, the set perfectly displays each heroes color - but it also provides more monochromatic areas for the actors to perform their personal dramatic asides.\n\nPreviousSlide 2/2The Best Yet to Come\n\nAt four episodes in, The Defenders has only just scratched the surface of The Hand's plans for New York City. The series makes use of Elektra (Elodie Yung), now the Black Sky, as a physical enforcer and threat, but has so far only hinted at origins and capabilities of the mysterious antagonist Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver). If there's a weak spot in The Defenders narrative so far, it's the reliance on Iron Fist's backstory, which is rooted in K'un Lun. Danny's talk of mystical cities and dragons feels out of place in the street-level drama of The Defenders - especially since his own series never realized the promise of Danny's origin. But even the pressure on this point gets relieved a bit, with new revelations about the history of The Hand, and some levity from the other heroes listening to Danny's fantastical story.\n\nIn the end, Marvel's The Defenders does an admirable of giving fans what they want by drawing its heroes together, without treating the alliance like fan service. The Defenders team has a distinct purpose, and each character's narrative is given the time, space, and respect it deserves. That modicum of restraint makes the heroes' time together feel that much more exciting, and even with the methodical pacing, there's no shortage of humor and action to be had.\n\nAssuming the series can maintain that balance throughout its back half, The Defenders is easily the most entertaining superhero team up since The Avengers.\n\nThe DefendersSunday at on Netflix ComicBook Composite 90.00

It's a successful meshing of the four characters, something The Defenders fights hard but not always successfully to achieve, and once it feels natural and starts to elicit the \"OK, let's do this\" vibe from the viewers (and the characters themselves), it's both fun to watch and laudable.\n\nIt's also precisely the mode Rand/Iron Fist should be in the most often, but can't, because his eponymous show, the weakest of the solo series quartet, demands that he be so damned serious all the time (while almost never delivering any of the necessary gravitas). In fact, where The Defenders struggles mightily is in incorporating Jones/Iron Fist into its little conceit of gathering all four heroes together to fight a very big bad (Sigourney Weaver and friends) about to put a dent in New York City.\n\n\"I am the Immortal Iron Fist!\" Jones is forced to say several, extremely unconvincing, times -- and the only time it works is when Luke and Jessica are looking at him like he's insane. If only Marvel could lean into their mistake of not reimagining a comic book character to be, say, Asian, and play to whatever strengths and believability Jones might possess as the character! But Marvel has historically shown little interest in admitting either conceptual or casting mistakes.\n\nSo, that part is too bad. For at least one scene, the completely unwatchable Iron Fist franchise seemed to have hit on its own fix, and, for viewers who might have wished the Defenders were a trio, there was a tiny glimmer of hope that maybe this whole thing could work without a quarter of its prequel series being a total nonstarter.\n\nAnd who knows, by the late third episode and all of the fourth episode, things are jelling much better as a concept and as a story, which allows Iron Fist to just be a guy at the party, not a whole separate story that needs explaining again -- which partly drags down the first two episodes (in fairness, the whole Matt Murdock reluctant-blind-hero thing is also a less tantalizing act than those of Jessica or Luke, but at least Cox sells his character and has the chops to pull off some of the wince-inducing dialogue from that origin story).\n\nAnd yes, it should come as no surprise that some eye-rolly writing drags down even the best parts of The Defenders, which is partly the fault of the writers of course but also partly due to the wholly weak comic DNA, where obvious shows of emotion and declarative sentences dipped in gooey cheese are part of the deal.\n\nAnd yet, despite all of that, The Defenders morphs into a likeable and enjoyable collaboration by the third episode and is helped immeasurably in the fourth by Scott Glenn as Stick, as it is through the entirety by the wonderful Weaver; the two older actors lend a lot of welcome authority and conviction to the cornier underpinnings.\n\nAs these things go, The Defenders really could have imploded conceptually, but it is really thriving by its midpoint and gives off the impression that moving forward things will drastically improve, even if it can't completely explain the nefarious goings-on of the Hand, the shadowy group that Weaver leads, which is understandable. At least the writers can cut through the claptrap with Jones' sass, as when she says, \"These names are killing me\" when Glenn's character reveals he's the last of a group called the Chaste. Earlier, when Murdock is morphing into Daredevil mode, sans costume, he borrows Jones' scarf to cover his head and his eyes. \"You look like an asshole,\" she says, rightly (he's wearing his lawyering suit, so, yeah). \"It's your scarf\" he sneers back.\n\nMarvel knows how to play for laughs what it's like when you bring together disparate worlds -- it has a lot of practice doing this on the big screen. The natural dubiousness each hero feels toward the other is ripe for comedy and, for the most part, it plays perfectly well in The Defenders.\n\nSome of the bonus elements in this mashup come from making Daredevil a little colder, a little more badass and believable (or at least more interesting) and the aforementioned brief moments of Iron Fist actually being watchable. If he never had to deliver an emphatic, dramatic line again, that character might be ... oh, never mind.\n\nElsewhere, Colter and Ritter (especially) prove in every scene why they hold down the two most compelling series. Here they get to grow a little bit as well (ideally that would be part of the plan of The Defenders, one would think) and that should help their individual shows and characters in the long run.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302797", "label": {"eng": "Cover version"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "311297", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313388", "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327311", "label": {"eng": "Mashup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "465006", "label": {"eng": "Scott Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "569522", "label": {"eng": "Stick (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(book)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "969452", "label": {"eng": "Mashup (book)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaste_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1033070", "label": {"eng": "Chaste (Marvel Comics)"}}]}

Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Danny Rand have had their fair share of individual struggles, but nothing compares to the threat that brings them all together for their team-up series, The Defenders. They'll have to set their individual struggles aside, which range from getting thrown in prison to finding out that the mystical hidden city that gave Iron Fist his hand power has vanished. When The Defenders takes place, the wounds from the heroes' individual struggles are still fresh. But with a larger threat looming over New York, there's no time to worry about what brought them to this point.\n\nThe mini-series crossover event has been confirmed to take place a few months after the various series leading up to it -- but that doesn't really solidify any timeline. A couple of actors from the series have revealed the length of the time jumps between when we last saw them and when The Defenders begins, which could provide an accurate starting point. Assuming that all of the Defenders series take place in a chronological order -- which it seems that they do -- Jessica Jones has had a very long break and Iron Fist has barely had time to catch his breath.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Iron Fist's Jessica Henwick revealed some details about where her character Colleen Wing will be in The Defenders. \"We find [Colleen] a month after we left her,\" she said. \"It's really interesting she hasn't been able to deal with the emotional trauma she dealt with in Iron Fist.\" So while The Defenders takes place only a month after the events of Iron First -- the most recent solo series -- other heroes have had some extra time to get their own lives in order before having to save New York... again.\n\nCharlie Cox, who plays Matt Murdock, explained in a separate Entertainment Weekly interview that although Daredevil has had a few extra months to himself, he's still reeling from trauma. \"Well, it's been a few months since the end of Season 2,\" he explained. \"I think it's been quite a challenging few months for him. He took the death of Elektra very badly -- I think he feels responsible for that.\"\n\nWhile Daredevil's most recent season dropped in March of 2016, less time than that has passed for the characters. That suggests that, though these Marvel series may have been spaced out over the course of over two years, all the action may have happened within a year's time.\n\nThe Defender who has had the longest break from the screen is Jessica Jones, who was last seen in her own series in late 2015, preceding Daredevil Season 2.

The blind lawyer with incredible agility and enhanced senses, Matt \"Daredevil\" Murdock, has ditched his vigilante guise and is back to fighting for the disadvantaged in a courtroom. The invulnerable Luke Cage is out of prison, having atoned for past crimes. The ever-cynical and super-strong Jessica Jones is running her more-successful-than-ever private eye business, and still numbing her pain with booze. And mystical warrior Danny \"Iron Fist\" Rand is busy uncovering the imminent threat of a nefarious martial arts organization known as The Hand.\n\nThe first episode's script doesn't explain too much about who these people are or what adventures they've had in the past. The Defenders pretty much assumes that viewers will have watched all those other Marvel seasons, in full.\n\nBut let me propose something that some may find hard to believe. You don't need to have seen any of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, or Iron Fist to enjoy The Defenders -- nor do you have to know anything about the original Marvel super-team comic that gave the series its name. I'll go even further: The Defenders is the best of Netflix's Marvel shows so far, and the way it just dives right into its story is how all genre TV should be.\n\n\"Prestige television\" has a \"season-bloat\" problem. The sophistication and experimentation that premium cable and subscription services allow should be freeing up writers, directors, and producers to rethink what a \"TV episode\" or \"TV season\" means. But in practice, creators have largely stuck to the old narrative structures -- with episodes that run 30 minutes or an hour, and seasons that run 10 or 13 episodes -- while making what they claim are extended length \"movies,\" telling one long story.\n\nVulture's Kathryn VanArendonk took aim at this trend back in March, in her essay \"Why Are We So Sure 'Prestige' TV Looks Like a 10-Hour Movie?\" and her even more cutting listicle \"13 Signs You're Watching a 'Prestige' TV Show.\" Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall has been beating the drum against \"it's like a novel for television\" or \"it's like a 10-hour movie\" for a while now, in essays arguing in favor of episodes that tell their own stories. Recently, Sepinwall warned that shows which take forever to get to the point are at risk of being abandoned after an episode or two. In response to that, The New York Times' James Poniewozik suggested something akin to what I'm saying regarding The Defenders: that if you hear a show doesn't \"get good\" until episode six, then start watching with episode six.\n\nI don't mean to imply that Netflix's other Marvel efforts aren't worthwhile. Daredevil combines the grounded realism of police procedurals and legal dramas with action sequences that rival the best of martial arts movies. Jessica Jones is a hard-boiled, noir-inflected private-eye show that doubles as an intimate character study of a troubled young woman. Luke Cage takes the tough-guy posturing and \"defending the defenseless\" premises of black cinema classics like Shaft and Foxy Brown and updates them for the hip-hop era. All of them work the characters' various superpowers casually into the story, making them feel more natural and less fantastical. Iron Fist is the only one of the bunch that's a real dud.\n\nStill, I have to admit that watching the first season of Daredevil back in the spring of 2015 was when I really began to recognize how much the inclination toward slowness and seriousness in modern television had become insidious. Whenever the characters on Daredevil weren't fighting, they were sitting inertly in darkened rooms, quietly muttering about how unhappy they were. Every dialogue scene lasted twice as long as it needed to, and was marred by a general lack of energy and enthusiasm.\n\nNetflix only made the first four of The Defenders' eight episodes available to critics, but the miniseries' more accelerated tempo is obvious from episode one, which bounces from character to character while establishing the story and the stakes. By the end of the hour, we know where each of the heroes and their various friends and allies are at in their lives, and we've met this corner of the Marvel Universe's intriguing new villain, Alexandra (played by Sigourney Weaver), a stealthy New York power broker going through a personal crisis.\n\nBy the end of the first episode, a cataclysmic event affects all the principals, reminding viewers that the characters occupy a lot of the same space in New York. By the end of episode two, their paths begin to cross, as Luke meets and tussles with Danny, and Matt helps Jessica out of legal trouble.\n\nThen episode three ends with one of the most thrilling sequences in the entire run of Netflix's Marvel shows, as one by one all four superheroes show up in Alexandra's elegantly furnished, well-lit boardroom, where they fight side-by-side against a seemingly unceasing wave of trained mercenaries. The imagery's clean and modern, the action's frenetic, and it's a real treat to see each character's unique fighting style, side-by-side.\n\nThe Defenders shares most of the virtues of the other Marvel TV programs. The characters are well-drawn and well-acted (including sidekicks and colleagues like Misty Knight, Colleen Wing, Claire Temple, Foggy Nelson, and \"Stick\"). The location shooting is frequently stunning, with kinetic camera moves and deep frames capturing the look and feel of a major metropolis. And the willingness to give scenes time and space to develop leads to some remarkable sequences -- like the extended prologue of episode three, where Alexandra brings one of Daredevil's old enemies back into the game.\n\nThe variety of personalities also adds a dynamism that's sometimes lacking from these characters' individual series. The well-earned skepticism of Jessica and Luke deflates some of the self-seriousness of Matt and Danny. (Just the way the other three look at Daredevil when he says, \"I can hear neon\" makes this team-up worthwhile.) And because The Defenders retains a lot of the texture and tone of its feeder-shows, there's a refreshing variety to the episodes from scene to scene -- unlike the often dreary sameness of a Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, or Iron Fist season.\n\nThat said, anyone who wants to diagnose the problem with prestige TV can find plenty of fodder in The Defenders. The show still sports scenes that run too long for no real reason -- such as a montage of Jessica Jones doing research in episode two that amounts to several minutes of her opening drawers, with barely any useful information provided to the audience during the bulk of the sequence.\n\nAnd episode four disappointingly reverts to modern TV's \"better tap the brakes before we accidentally entertain\" mentality. On the heels of the battle royale that ends episode three, the four heroes hunker down in a Chinese restaurant, where they reluctantly share information and bicker, doing whatever they can to avoid becoming the team that gives The Defenders its name.\n\nToo much of television these days attempts to \"elevate\" genre fare by keeping the fun stuff to a minimum. In The Defenders, Jessica even complains in episode one that she doesn't want her friend to \"say the h-word\" -- meaning she has no intention of embracing super-heroics. In the place of action and feats of wonder, shows like Netflix's Marvel collection inject long pauses, to give the characters time to consider whether they really want to advance to the next part of the story.\n\nTaking a moment to breathe and reflect can be a hallmark of strong storytelling. A good example of this is Game of Thrones, which this season has been bringing characters back together who haven't shared scenes in years, and has taken the time to let the meaning of their reunions soak in. The difference is that not long after the more emotional beats, Game of Thrones accelerates to huge battles, with fire-breathing dragons. The writers jump straight into the next set of crises, rather than deferring them until later.\n\nGiven that The Defenders only runs for eight episodes, I don't expect much more wheel-spinning going forward. Or at least I hope not. If these four heroes don't fight alongside each other again until the finale, that'll be a major letdown.\n\nIn fact, if the last four episodes of The Defenders are as good and to-the-point as the first three, here's hoping that Netflix and the creators who produce this kind of television will learn that we don't need to watch 13 hours of a hero very slowly and reluctantly springing into action to find their story \"believable\" or \"involving.\" We don't even need much in the way of backstory or context -- because we've all watched TV, seen movies, and read books before.\n\nHere's all a show like The Defenders needs to do: Just let us know that these four people all have superpowers, and they fight against evil. Then, show them doing just that.

While they assume just on name recognition alone The Defenders will flourish, but the reality is a vast majority of the people who will either review or watch this series have poor knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Instead of relying on the hope that everything is going to work out, Netflix has to get out of its own way.\n\nFor starters, after the debacle that was The Iron Fist, why would The Defenders center around Danny Rand? Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage are far better options to build this narrative around and yet the focus appears to be on Rand. It's Rand's ego driven choices that do more harm than good for the group. Rand spends most of his time talking about how horrible his life has been, his chi, and yes, telling everyone who will listen to him that he's The Iron Fist. This is just further evidence Marvel and Netflix need to strongly consider moving away from Finn Jones and recasting the role. However, the chances of that happening don't appear to be high.\n\nNetflix also needs to look at how they promote their shows. While I understand the need to only show the critics so many episodes so nothing is ruined, why would you pick episodes that set up the back half of the series? In the four episodes we were allowed to screen before the series was to go live, each one of them provided the reason each Defender decides to join the fight to save New York. We don't get a sense of where the story is headed or even if the story is one that should be told. The first four episodes of The Defenders are as if Luke Cage, Matt Murdock, and Jessica Jones were all transported into the first season of The Iron Fist.\n\nSigourney Weaver was a major selling point for this series but the first episodes are cut in such a way it's hard to get a feel for her character. We do know she's a crime lord and has no fear of dying. However, her motivation is unclear. Maybe if we had been able to see the whole series, it would have been understandable.\n\nElodie Yung's return to Marvel is welcomed, however, she's criminally underused. Her fight sequences are electrifying and provide one of the few highlights. One can hope in the back half of The Defenders, we see much more of Yung and her purpose is more defined.\n\nHad The Defenders focused on the growing threat towards New York and less on the backstory (we get why they are doing this), the series would have been so much better. The fight sequences (as few as they were) were great but as the show meanders along the lack of visceral action becomes glaring.\n\nIt's hard to recommend a show that feels this poorly executed. If you are a huge of all things Marvel, perhaps give this series a chance.

This review will be spoiler free as per an embargo agreement.\n\nMarvel's The Defenders starts off slow but takes the four genres from the solo series' and slowly blends them to make a unique team dynamic we haven't seen before in the Marvel Universe.\n\nCreator: Marco Ramirez\n\nSummary: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist team up to fight crime in New York City.\n\nThe Defenders was going to be a unique crossover regardless of how it turned out. These are four different series coming together in a way we have really only seen work once in the past, with the Avengers. There was no telling that Marvel and Netflix were going to make lightning strike again, this time in their television universe. We know it worked in the movies, but now it's time to see if Marvel can make the team-up thing work with their television universe. The first episode of The Defenders does exactly what you would expect the first part of a team-up show to do; it demonstrates where each member of the team is. However, instead of just showing each team member in different locations, the show changes the colors of the world to fit the character. Jessica (Krysten Ritter) is often featured in a world that is purple, Matt (Charlie Cox) is surrounded by red, the world of Luke (Mike Colter) seems to bathe in gold, and Danny (Finn Jones) is constantly surrounded by green. This even applies to our villains, because Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver) is often surrounded in white and gold.\n\nWhile the first four episodes are good and fun to watch, they take a little while to get going. We don't see all four of the Defenders in the same room until the end of the third episode when we finally get that hallway fight that we've been waiting for. The little \"meet cutes\" happen between Luke and Danny and Jessica and Matt until we see the four of them finally end up in the same place at the same time. Each of them are on their own path that eventually ends up with the three of them fighting the same enemy but it takes considerable time for the four of them to get there. Once they do the series really feels like it comes alive as most of episode four is spent around a table hashing out their personality differences and trying to figure out what the hell is going on. We still don't know entirely but the chemistry that makes all of these team up shows important is there. Danny and Luke had their fight and pissing contest earlier, much to the chagrin of Claire (Rosario Dawson) and Colleen (Jessica Henwick). Matt becomes Jessica's lawyer when it becomes apparent that she's getting in over her head.\n\nWe don't get a lot of fight scenes aside from the one hallway fight, but it's all very well lit compared to other fights in the Netflix Marvel universe. The thing that immediately stands out is that all four of our fighters have their own distinctive fighting style. While Jones still looks a little out of his element as far fighting goes, it does look like the stunt work and fight choreography is better than Iron Fist was. Maybe not completely up to expert level but still pretty good. It's nice to see the four distinct fighting styles coming from four different people with very different skill sets. Weaver is crazy good as Alexandra, and while it isn't totally clear what her motivations are she is a commanding presence. While some didn't like Jones as Danny, it seems like he's coming into his in this role. As for the rest of the cast, we already know that they are fantastic in their roles. Elodie Yung in particular has been handed what is essentially, without spoiling, almost an entirely new character.\n\nThe Defenders is off to a solid start thus far, and while it's hard to say whether the story is going to work all the way through, the first half is engaging and leaves you wanting more. While there are times during those two and a half episodes that you're going to be wishing everyone would just meet, the payoff is pretty good. Our four heroes have a great chemistry, which is half the fun of team-ups. The rest of the series is a little under a month away so we'll have to see how everything comes together in the end.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303484", "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "311297", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_combat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "378360", "label": {"eng": "Stage combat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "409370", "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9lodie_Yung", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "745907", "label": {"eng": "\u00c9lodie Yung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Henwick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "749745", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Henwick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

A quartet of singular heroes with one common goal - to save New York City. This is the story of four solitary figures, burdened with their own personal challenges, who realize they just might be stronger when teamed together.\n\nRead below for a SPOILER-FREE breakdown of what makes this Marvel crossover event worth watching.\n\nPreviousSlide 1/2Next Crossover Payoff\n\nSimply put: The Defenders capitalizes on the \"worlds collide\" appeal of its premise, in the best ways. Watching Charlie Cox's Daredevil, Krysten Ritter's Jessica Jones, Mike Colter's Luke Cage, Finn Jones' Iron Fist (and all their supporting characters) dispensing trash-talk, punches, and/or soul-searching advice in shifting arrangements is just as (if not more) fun than seeing them actually battle the evil threat looming over them.\n\nBecause fans are so deeply intimate and familiar with the characters and worlds of each hero, it makes the experience of seeing all those worlds come together that much richer. Defenders does a great job pulling together story threads that were dangled in each individual series, demonstrating some of the best cohesion we've seen from the MCU.\n\nPreviousSlide 2/2Great Action\n\nThe Defenders does deliver great superhero action - and then some. We get to see each individual hero throw down, see them fight in various smaller (but still awesome) combinations, and, of course, fighting as a complete unit.\n\nIf you were worried that the show would suffer from some of the weak fight choreography we saw in Iron Fist, then don't. The Defenders has exciting action in just its first four episodes with even bigger fight sequences sure to come.\n\nAt four episodes in, the show has only just scratched the surface of The Hand's plans for New York City. The series makes use of Elektra (Elodie Yung) as The Black Sky, as a physical enforcer and action highlight, but has so far only hinted at origins and capabilities of the mysterious antagonist Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver), and her cohorts in the The Hand leadership.\n\nExpect The Defenders to endure some epic battles in order to save New York.\n\nThe Defenders premieres on August 18th, on Netflix.\n\nThe DefendersSunday at on Netflix ComicBook Composite 89.47 NAAll-Time Comic TV Shows Average rating Star Star Star Star Star 4.47/5 from 19 usersNAAll-Time Rated Full Profile Start Slideshow Back to Article Slide of\n\nby Kofi Outlaw | August 17, 2017", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 1058, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trash-talk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "325883", "label": {"eng": "Trash-talk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_crossover", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "343622", "label": {"eng": "Fictional crossover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_combat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "378360", "label": {"eng": "Stage combat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9lodie_Yung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "745907", "label": {"eng": "\u00c9lodie Yung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

It takes some time before the Defenders actually come together for a common cause, and in the interim, the series itself almost feels like four different shows happening at once: quick-cuts of New York subway trains, bridges and other forms of the city's iconography serve as separation points between the noir-heavy Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) scenes and the red lighting of the Daredevil (Charlie Cox) sequences, for instance, lending to an early sense of separation before the big team-up.\n\nAccording to showrunner Marco Ramirez, the distinction between characters and their scenes is by design, so as to make the moment of their coming together even more impactful. Here's what Ramirez told The Hollywood Reporter about those storytelling choices and more, including what the show owes to The Avengers, the decision to cast the series' antagonist in a fairly sympathetic light, and just how much viewers need to remember from the four different Marvel-Netflix shows that have already passed.\n\nThe Defenders is the culmination of four different TV shows. How important is it that everyone has seen those four shows before watching this one? Is it necessary to enjoying The Defenders?\n\nIt's not necessary. It was always part of the design, that Marvel and Netflix always wanted us to make a show where audiences could dive into it without having seen any of the others. You could just hypothetically come in and watch The Defenders. With that said, if you have seen the other shows, the idea is to never make a show that's redundantly telling you something you already know about these other stories. That was the trapeze act of figuring out the writing, making sure to never be expository but also make sure it wasn't a requirement that you would have to do seven weeks of homework, or whatever the math is on binge-watching five seasons of television.\n\nSo, if someone hasn't seen Iron Fist, for instance, they won't be lost on Danny Rand (Finn Jones)?\n\nSure, yeah. Exactly. If you haven't seen any of the other shows, you should be able to pick up and figure out that that's how this person fits into this world. It could be your first [show]. Marvel has a corporate slogan in the comic books world, that every comic book is somebody's first comic. We tried to continue that here a little bit. You don't have to have seen the entirety of any of the individual shows in order to get this one.\n\nWhat was the biggest challenge of pulling this show together?\n\nThe biggest challenge was the idea that the tonal differences between all of the shows are so vastly different and unique. That works to each of the shows' credit. Jessica Jones is very different from Luke Cage, which is very different from Iron Fist, which is very different from Daredevil. When you then have to think about combining those in the same dish, it kind of feels like, \"Wait a second. What's going on?\" So the trick of this show is that Marvel and Netflix have made four vastly different shows. What's it like when we combine them all together into one thing? That was the challenge, the tone. But what the writers realized and the directors realized and I realized while running it is, the very problem of the show is the key to entering the show. Yes, it doesn't make sense that Jessica Jones and Danny Rand are sitting at the same dinner table. She should hear his story and say, \"That doesn't make any sense. Your chi is bullshit, your backstory is bullshit, and all the dragon stuff doesn't make any sense.\" That's actually the fun of the show, watching that interaction between Matt Murdock and Luke Cage encountering each other and saying, \"How are you bulletproof?\" and \"What do you mean, you're blind?\" The interactions should make the show more fun, not take you out of it.\n\nCertainly in the first four episodes, there's a feeling of what you just brought up, of almost the four shows happening simultaneously within this series. The Luke Cage scenes feel very much of a piece with the Luke Cage series, for instance. Is that by design?\n\nYes. As every one of these shows start folding into each other, we wanted them to feel like the most epitomal versions of those shows. The early Daredevil scenes should feel like the most Daredevil we could possibly go, with the most red lighting and filters. The Jessica Jones scenes should feel the most film noir with violet colors. The idea then is that when they start to cross-pollinate, we see something else start to emerge, and that's what the identity of this show is, which is kind of a combination of all the visual and sonic elements of each of their individual worlds.\n\nGiven the premise, one enters The Defenders expecting it to be an ensemble show. But for you, do you feel one of these heroes has an emotional throughline that carries us forward in the series more than the others? For instance, Matt has an extremely personal stake in the story, given the involvement of Elektra (Elodie Yung).\n\nIt's hard for me to tell, having worked on it, and trying so hard to make sure that that didn't happen. Honestly, I would like the ideal answer to be no. I don't want this to feel like it's so-and-so's show and everybody else is visiting. It should feel, and that's why we spent so much time on this in the first two episodes, that we are invested in every character. Yes, Matt and Elektra absolutely have history. But Elektra and other characters on the show quickly have history of their own that we get to see unfold. Danny Rand certainly has history with the Hand. While the Matt-Elektra relationship is very strong and is a very strong part of what makes the show tick, I don't think it's in any way the only backbone of the show.\n\nSigourney Weaver plays Alexandra, the villain of the piece. When we first meet her, she's receiving bad news about her health. What was the goal in introducing your villain in a fairly sympathetic light?\n\nIt was exactly that: It was about not painting her as a mustache-twirling villain who wants to do nothing but bad things to this city. Each of these shows have featured very compelling antagonists, whether that's Vincent D'Onofrio as Wilson Fisk or Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle or David Tennant as Kilgrave. There are a lot of very intellectually interesting people, some of whom aren't necessarily \"bad people.\" I would go as far as to not call them villains; they're just antagonists. They want the opposite thing that the heroes want, and that doesn't always make them bad. To me, it was important to introduce Alexandra in a way where she's actually vulnerable. She's not a \"super-villain.\" It was also very important to Sigourney. She wanted to play a character who wasn't two-dimensional. If she was a member of the Hand, she didn't want to be a nihilistic dark force. She wanted to really enjoy life. She wanted to enjoy living. She wanted to embrace the positive in what they're doing.\n\nThis is the first time it's happening on Marvel TV, but it's not the first time a bunch of disparate heroes have joined together in a live-action Marvel project. How much did you look at The Avengers as inspiration for The Defenders, or did you consciously avoid that film as you were crafting the series?\n\nWhen you have literally the footprints that The Avengers had, there's kind of no way to avoid the comparison and no way to avoid referencing it in the writers room. It's an incredible achievement and a great story told really well. But to me, aside from that, in the formation of the show in the writers room, it was important to me to talk about story templates and influences. We talked about The Dirty Dozen and Seven Samurai. We talked about movies and cinematic stories where characters came together who did not want to come together, who had their own in-fighting but ultimately came together to fight something bad in some way. I would like to think the influences are wide in that way.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri":

The eight-part Netflix series wastes no time getting into the action, but is somewhat slow picking up steam.\n\nThe streaming giant has already introduced the characters in the series \"Jessica Jones,\" \"Luke Cage,\" \"Daredevil\" and \"Iron Fist.\" If you've seen them, then you know they each include complicated mythologies.\n\nIf you're not familiar with them, then watching their stories get pieced together in \"The Defenders\" can be a bit of a slog. There are already 60 episodes of the four series available on Netflix, so fans of these superheroes are likely to be more patient.\n\nTo varying degrees, I'm among the latter. So bringing together the band of misfits -- played by Krysten Ritter, Mike Colter, Charlie Cox, Finn Jones -- already piqued my interest, but it was the presence of Sigourney Weaver as the primary villain that really makes this series.\n\nWe first meet her character, Alexandra, a wealthy woman, getting the news she has a terminal illness and only has a short time to live.\n\nIt gives her a degree of sympathy, but we soon learn she heads a powerful criminal organization. Still, Weaver's character never comes across as simply evil. Alexandra is sophisticated, even sensitive, appreciates the arts, and as we see, a survivor.\n\nIn a way, the character is the linchpin that keeps the early episodes together as it cuts between the four superheroes' stories, which includes many of the secondary characters in the series such as Rosario Dawson as Claire Temple and Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing.\n\nIn the early episodes, Alexandra's ultimate aim is murky. Apparently, her organization is capable of causing massive devastation in NYC -- there is a taste of that early on -- but to what end? She's clearly not about destruction, and while Alexandra is an intriguing shadowy figure, articulating what she was after would have given more focus and urgency to the plot.\n\nOtherwise, it seems like the four superheroes are mostly doing their own thing in the early episodes. As we meet them, we're re-introduced to their quirky natures. Ritter's grumpy but nearly invincible Jessica Jones is a favorite, and the actress is able to convey a lot with just a look.\n\nNow that she is free of her nemesis from the first season -- the mind-control villain Kilgrave (David Tennant) -- \"The Defenders\" gives us a hint where she might be in Season 2, expected next year. (A little less rage and beginning to see past him.)\n\nThe other superheroes remain pretty true to form. Daredevil (Cox) is the blind lawyer Matt Murdock, who has deadly martial-arts skills but a prickly personality. The impenetrable Luke Cage (Colter) is the quiet, determined type, and Iron Fist (Jones) is billionaire Danny Rand whose special power is in the name.\n\nOf course, when they meet up they won't get along. That is practically a plot pre-requisite in these stories. These are types who don't work well with others. Only Danny wants to. It's amusing that some fans of this Marvel quartet find Iron Fist irritating, seeing him as not strong enough of a personality or picking on Jones' performance, which is quite solid.\n\nThe character is excitable at times, but that makes sense. Danny has been raised by mystical monks most of his life. So the nearly 30-year-old superhero is emotionally a teen at times. It's an interesting twist, especially when he is with three stoic types.\n\n(By the way, \"Iron Fist\" has been renewed for a second season.)\n\nSo his character doesn't hit the usual superhero marks. The problem with many superhero stories is that is all they do.\n\nLike the other shows, \"The Defenders\" inserts a bit of welcome grit into its story. The showrunners of the individual series have also been smart enough to bring in strong actors such as Tennant and Vincent D'Onofrio as villains.\n\nHaving Weaver on board is a superplus for \"The Defenders,\" and Ritter is always on fire.\n\nUndoubtedly, fans will analyze the series to death, but don't sweat it. It's a fine superhero adventure even if you don't know all the characters. Just go with it.

Having served as showrunner on Daredevil Season 2, which had the added pressure of introducing Elektra and The Punisher to Matt Murdock's world, he was a natural fit for the culmination of Marvel's Netflix efforts, the superhero team-up The Defenders.\n\nAs part of our behind the scenes look at what went into making the show, we spoke with Mr. Ramirez by phone about the challenges of taking four characters, each capable of headlining their own series, and bringing them together in a way that remains true to all the hard work that has come before.\n\nDen of Geek: One thing that I am trying to figure out just for my own frame of reference here... How far after the end of Iron Fist does this take place? I know these are all kind of in real time, but roughly where are these?\n\nI know that Marvel has a very strict chronology of when all these shows have happened and how they've happened, but we just say weeks to months. So that Danny and Colleen could have been on their quest for a couple of months [and]we could assume that Matt Murdock has had some time to decompress after all the Elektra stuff in Daredevil season 2 and \"coming out\" to Karen. So yeah, we've been saying months, or weeks to months.\n\nWhen did you learn you has the showrunner gig for The Defenders? Were you still doing Daredevil season 2?\n\nStill in the final movements of Daredevil season 2, yeah. It was somewhere around shooting the finale and editing the finale. Jeph Loeb kind of presented the opportunity, and it had to be kept secret for a little bit. It was fun to get cast questions and to not be able to answer. That was kind of fun. It's kind of like planning a surprise party.\n\nDaredevil is a main thread for The Defenders. Were you aware of some of the things that were going to have to get picked up in The Defenders even before you got the showrunner's gig?\n\nMarvel had a sense of all the threads that would need to be picked up from Iron Fist. I think Luke Cage was in the process where they were still writing the last couple episodes, so the writers for The Defenders got to see the first couple episodes of Luke Cage before they came out so [the writers]got a good sense of who Mike [Colter] was and how Luke sounded, and what his world was.\n\nMarvel didn't have story specifics in terms of what needed to happen in Defenders. It was more like, you know, kind of opening a curtain and saying, \"This is what's happening on these other shows because you absolutely need to know.\" But ideally, I feel like we're carrying over everybody's stories into the next chapter, so this should also feel like Luke Cage season 1.5, and Jessica Jones season 1.5 to a certain degree. So it's not like everyone is guest starring in one other person's show, but rather like all four of them coming together.\n\nYeah, and it does feel like that. I was amazed by how in the first episode each of those little sections reintroduces everyone. It's like Daredevil season 2, episode 13a. Did you go to the other showrunners for advice as well?\n\nYeah, I mean they were around. A lot of it was obviously through Marvel, who kind of funneled everything back with a lot of information. But yeah, it really helps geographically that we're all in the same building. So, you know, I developed a friendship with [Luke Cage showrunner] Cheo Coker, so it was nice to be able to just walk over to Cheo and ask him questions about Luke, and what Misty would sound like, and how Luke would interact, and that kind of stuff. So it was good that we would just weirdly be on this campus where we're all making stuff from the same DNA, just to make sure that we weren't contradicting stories or repeating stories. We wanted to make sure everyone was on the up and up.\n\nHow long did it take you to figure out an organic way to bring everybody together?\n\nA couple of months, to be frank. But I will say one of the first things I think I knew was that we had to take our time. One of the great benefits of working on a Netflix show is because they release all the episodes at the same time, there's the ultimate promise to the audience to just stay with us, we're getting there. We'll get to the stuff you came for. There was never any rush to get there so that they would have to, you know, \"Tune in next week so that, as promised, you get all your people together.\" It really felt like we could use the format as a way to tell the story really organically, and so the slow burn of it, and the slow mixing of ingredients, that was -- I didn't know how, but I knew that's what we needed to do.\n\nIt also felt like we need to do the two different threads first. You know, where JJ and Matt meet, and Danny and Luke meet, and then we fold those together. So it felt like we're mixing ingredients together slowly and organically, rather than having them all recruited by someone saying, \"You all need to work together now\" in episode one. That's not -- maybe that's spoilery to talk about -- but that felt like not the right way to tell this story. These characters needed to get there on their own as opposed to being told, \"This is happening.\" Jessica Jones has so much agency, Luke Cage has such a drive, Matt Murdock is so complicated. Everyone's just so unique. It just felt wrong to get them all on the same page and not make that part of the story. We need to eventually get them all on the same page versus they're all on the same page 20 minutes in.\n\nI know everybody kind of expects when these team ups happen -- because of the Avengers movies and because of what happens on the CW shows -- when they happen, they automatically become bigger. So far, you've done a real good job of keeping it grounded in this corner of the universe. But does that scale increase as we go forward? Was there any pressure to bring a certain amount of spectacle later in the series?\n\nThere is only in terms of of the promise of excitement as you reach a climax, but that's just storytelling 101. I worked on Sons of Anarchy for two years, and it felt like we got our bloodiest episodes at the end of a season, you know? So that was where that happened. But here, I really think, yeah. To a certain degree, sure, it gets a little bit bigger as it opens. But really, in terms of spectacle and scale, these are really character-centered shows and really grounded ones. And so, you know, the biggest things that might happen in later episodes are the characters making big decisions.\n\nWe don't fight in the sky on this show. These stories happen in the back alleys of New York, so in a weird way, when we talk about spectacle as really fun stuff to get to, in some case, it was as simple as, \"Oh my god, I can't wait to use this needle drop on the scene.\" Or, \"Oh my god, I can't wait for these two people to finally see each other, or these people to finally address that thing.\" It wasn't always about special effects, spectacles, and big bombastic fight scenes. Sometimes, it was just about moments you know that the audience have been waiting for that we would finally give them in the last couple of episodes. You know, a certain team-up or a certain nod to the comics in a big way that people may have been waiting for for several seasons. That felt just as big as something practically big, like cars exploding or stuff getting thrown around.\n\nI know there's probably not a lot you can say about the villain, but how did you end up casting Sigourney Weaver?\n\nI mean, it never happens this way. It never happens that a team of writers sits around and spit balls a character and come up with a character, and thinks, \"Okay, this is a Sigourney Weaver type.\" And then talks about it like that for several months, and eventually, Marvel and Netflix say \"Sigourney's on the phone. She wants to talk about the character.\" So just in terms of that process, it was kind of surreal to have thought about her -- I think we even had her headshot up on the wall. Whenever we referenced the character, we would talk about and point to that thing, so eventually, when I was on the phone with her talking about the role, it suddenly felt like... Not only has my life long dream come true of working with Ripley, it's also, that was a character we've been talking about for so long, if you want to, you know, talk about her and how to make her interesting and three dimensional. So really, it was one of those dream scenarios.\n\nWe talked about this character a Sigourney Weaver type. We never expected to get Sigourney Weaver on the line, and much less on set. So I think we were all excited. The writers were all excited. The directors, I'm sure they're all thrilled about the cast as well.\n\nThe Marvel Netflix shows have been immune to that larger Marvel \"curse\". People say, \"Well, you know, the villain's not really strong enough in the Marvel movies.\" You can't say that about Kilgrave or Kingpin.\" So where does Sigourney's Alexandra fit on this spectrum?\n\nThe villains...it's even tricky to call them villains. Something I noticed when working on Daredevil Season 1, we never really talked about Fisk as being bad. He was just this other character who wanted another version of New York. I think you could probably say that about Cottonmouth in some capacity on Luke Cage, although Kilgrave is most definitely a villain.\n\nI really think it's just that TV is different than film, and in TV, scenes are king, not massive fights or big spectacle, or costume, or anything like that. It's really just about ultimately what people do in scenes. And so when you think about what I think about -- the most proud that we did with Fisk season one of Daredevil, they're scenes. When I think about the things I love most about Kilgrave and about Cottonmouth, it's always come down to great scenes, great monologues, great moments. People just making really great decisions. And so it's not hard, I don't think, to just automatically by default think about those characters as really sophisticated characters first, and not what kind of superpower does so and so have. Even Kilgrave's power is relatively grounded, because it's ultimately this mental sophisticated thing.\n\nIn the Netflix world, they constantly encouraged us to go with more and more sophisticated cable drama with the characters, with who we'd call villains or antagonists. We've just always been encouraged to make them as complicated as possible. This is the network that gave us House of Cards. They're not interested in black and white villains. They really want everyone to feel really complicated and interesting. So that's the promise.\n\nI'll be frank, I think that was part of the allure, I think, to someone like Sigourney. She was very excited by the idea of joining the Kilgraves and the Fisks of the Marvel Universe. She was very excited at the thought of being one of these really smart, sophisticated, manipulative, powerful people who doesn't have to use what we would consider comic book supervillain tropes to get what they want. And it ultimately comes down to scenes. And I think that's what she responded to. So I hope that somehow answers that question.\n\nI guess it does? [Laughs] And this is an original character, right?\n\nAlexandra is a character that's... You know what? I can't answer that question.\n\nOkay, fair enough. So this has to go into production right after Iron Fist wrapped, right? Were you guys already connecting the dots? How long of a lead time in terms of pre-production and things like that? This is a very challenging project.\n\nYeah, it was very challenging. The great part is that we were able to carry over a lot of the Marvel crew from previous shows. So a lot of the crew that were on these shows just kind of roll from one into the other, so they're very familiar with the world, they're very familiar with the system, and they're very familiar with the secrecy of how we have to shoot in New York. I believe almost everyone has worked in the Marvel-Netflix world. Our heads of departments have all worked there before. Seeing how they kind of roll from the Iron Fist production right into ours, and then similarly at the very end of production, Krysten Ritter had to roll right from the end of Defenders right into Jessica Jones Season 2. It's very much like the trains are moving. People, get on them. I think a lot of our crew came right after either Iron Fist or Luke Cage Season 1.\n\nDaredevil Season 2 was pretty large scale. When you factor in characters like Elektra and Punisher, that's almost like having two more leads the way you have four leads here. Was this a tougher production? Is there more pressure on you from Marvel, for example, because this is the thing they've been building to?\n\nIt was different. In some ways, Daredevil Season 2 felt like a dry run to what Defenders really was. Some of the exciting challenges in Daredevil Season 2 were that we were kind of creating Elektra and Frank Castle in that world. We were casting them. We were figuring out what their voices sounded like. We were doing a lot of that, and that was really exciting. Some of the similar but different challenges in Defenders was that these characters already existed. They were already casted. Their voices were already distinct. The actors certainly have really good senses of who they were. So it was a little different in terms of -- I wasn't creating Jessica Jones, or Luke Cage, or Danny Rand. They already exist on their own shows. I was just seeing where those voices fit into this world and how those voices sounded when they bounce off each other. So they're very different.\n\nOn one hand, yeah, it was nice to have Daredevil Season 2. On the other hand, it was a lot of... I jokingly called it leasing the car. I lease Luke Cage for the episodes, and I had to turn him right back in to Cheo to go do season 2. I leased Jessica Jones so I could turn her back in and [Jessica Jones showrunner] Melissa [Rosenberg] could give her a great story.\n\nWhat kind of input from Marvel do you get?\n\nIt's interesting the stuff that's very important versus the stuff that they're open to hear new ideas on. That is really interesting. And of course, between the Jeph Loebs and the Joe Quesadas of the world, you have these comic book geniuses who are legends. I grew up reading their comics, so whenever they have notes on how Matt Murdock would do something, I listen real close.\n\nBut on the other hand, I'm taking a character and giving them a new rhyme or a new spin. I'm writing for a new medium, so those conversations have been interesting and exciting in terms of this is how such and such thing would work best in the comics. And the TV writers have to say, \"In this art form, this is how to best tell that story or how to best serve it.\" So it's been an interesting dance between how established and what the audience think, what the audience love about it, and the new medium. And on top of that, this kind of new realm that Netflix has given us to play -- these sophisticated characters driven stories -- the super powers are kind of one of the last things that you take into account on these shows. It's really about the characters and who the people are. The superpowers and the origins, that all comes way, way later on the importance scale, I think.\n\nMarvel's The Defenders premieres on Netflix on August 18.\n\nRead and download the full Gearsofbiz magazine here!", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(U.S._TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304814", "label": {"eng": "House of Cards (U.S. TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306566", "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW_Television_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "310192", "label": {"eng": "The CW Television Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311297", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313307", "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervillain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "318518", "label": {"eng": "Supervillain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "333571", "label": {"eng": "Civil War (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "342245", "label": {"eng": "Punisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Anarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345207", "label": {"eng": "Sons of Anarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeph_Loeb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "408147", "label": {"eng": "Jeph Loeb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingpin_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "437318", "label": {"eng": "Kingpin (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Man", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "531012", "label": {"eng": "Purple Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottonmouth_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "599148", "label": {"eng": "Cottonmouth (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

Here's what we saw\n\nWhile The Defenders is plagued by some of the same issues as Netflix's earlier superhero solo series (like the pacing), it sounds like the fearsome foursome are fabulous together.\n\nHeck, it even sounds like they've figured out a way to deal with the unpopular Iron Fist - by having the other characters constantly acknowledge that Danny Rand is kind of the worst. If it's not enough to make you love him, hopefully it's enough to make you tolerate him.\n\nAnd Sigourney Weaver? It won't surprise you to hear that she's every bit as good as we'd hoped when her casting was first announced.\n\nAll the reviews below are from critics who saw the first four episodes (out of eight). What happens in the second half of the show is still a mystery, but at least now we know it gets off to a good start.\n\nJeff Jensen, Entertainment Weekly:\n\nUntil now, Netflix's Marvel series have been 13 episodes long. The producers of those shows, even the better ones, have never been able to generate enough plot to fill the time, resulting in thinly stretched, poorly paced volumes of story -- they just don't know how to vamp in compelling fashion. [...] The Defenders is eight episodes long, and damn if it doesn't make the case that less is more.\n\nSteve O'Brien, Digital Spy:\n\nThe Defenders' chief strength is that it's telling its story in just eight episodes, as opposed to the other series' 13. Lumpish pace and thin plotting has blighted other Marvel Netflix shows, and while this one isn't exactly breakneck (it still has the steady, unhurried canter of a cable drama), it only takes three episodes for our heroes to... erm... assemble.\n\nKelly Lawler, USA Today:\n\nFrom the first scene, Danny Rand/Iron Fist is an undeniable handicap. [...] So how do you build a series when three heroes are appealing, well-formed characters with strong actors behind them, but the fourth is annoying, boring and poorly acted? One would hope that The Defenders would shy away from Danny and his petulance, but unfortunately, Iron Fist is integral to the larger plot. Every scene featuring him drags, and he is in too many to ignore, with clunkier dialogue than his fellows.\n\nJeff Jensen, Entertainment Weekly:\n\nAnd Danny Rand, a.k.a. Iron Fist, billionaire hippie and magical white savior of the mystical Easter kingdom of K'un-Lun is... tolerable. His character is central to the story -- Marvel is going to make you love this guy, dammit! -- and almost everything about him remains laughably dumb, from his mythology to the concept and special effect of his \"iron fist.\" But Finn works hard, so hard it's actually endearing.\n\nSusana Polo, Polygon:\n\nI won't say that I found Danny likable by the end of the fourth episode. But The Defenders clearly understands what it needs to do with his character to make it plausible that, say, Luke Cage would be interested in giving him the time of day, much less fight for his cause. And mostly that means having other characters call him on his bullshit constantly -- and to have him listen.\n\nJeff Jensen, Entertainment Weekly:\n\nThe Defenders is blessed by a dynamite actress and geek pop royalty: Sigourney Weaver plays Alexandra, death-defying leader of an occult underworld organization known as The Hand. She makes a generic part pop with nuanced menace and elevates everyone involved, notably Elodie Yung as the assassin Elektra.\n\nDanette Chavez, The A.V. Club:\n\nIn Weaver's hands, Alexandra is formidable and intriguing, swaddled as she is in what often look like really expensive duvets. Although she's informed by other MCU villains -- Alexandra shares Ronan The Accuser's zealotry, Mariah's poise, and Ultron's indifference to the human condition -- she's much more than just an amalgam. She's closer to a time lord than a hand-rubbing baddie; she's both detached from and invested in humanity.\n\nAlan Sepinwall, Uproxx:\n\nAs she always does no matter how outlandish the premise of her latest project, Weaver plays things straight and with abundant screen presence; the only downside is that -- like Vincent D'Onfrio as the Kingpin on Daredevil -- she tends to pretty badly overshadow the leads when they're together. (The show feels most balanced in the scenes she shares with Scott Glenn, who has a similar gift for being utterly matter-of-fact about all this insanity.)\n\nDanette Chavez, The A.V. Club:\n\nThe first half of the season is a potent mix of humor, dread, and ass-kicking. Even with Iron Fist tagging along as the annoying younger brother -- who could buy and sell you and the building you live in a thousand times over -- the Defenders shine as a team and as individuals (well, most of them).\n\nKelly Lawler, USA Today:\n\nThe Defenders will likely please devoted Marvel fans who merely want to see these four in the same room. The fight scene that finally brings them together checks all the fan-service boxes, as when Iron Fist stands behind Luke as he takes bullets. But viewers who were attracted to one or more of the Netflix series for their unique perspectives will be disappointed.\n\nAlan Sepinwall, Uproxx:\n\nAll the Netflix/Marvel shows have been imperfect to varying degrees, and the parts of Defenders that actually, you know, feature all the Defenders are promising enough -- if only for the chance to watch Jessica continually insult the others -- for me to gladly watch the second half. (Which I declined to do for Iron Fist.) But it would be nice if at some point, both show and team could justify their existence as something more than a package Marvel put together years ago in the hopes everything would work out.\n\nMatt Webb Mitovich, TV Line:\n\nBut again, just as when the Avengers first assembled, much of the joy here is seeing disparate personalities get to know each other (the Immortal Iron Fist's dragon-costarring origin story prompts Jessica to ask if he's \"on lithium\") and reluctantly embrace the T-word -- team.\n\nAllison Keene, Collider:\n\nThere's more humor, too, which at first feels a little out of place when everything else is played with such seriousness, but it's also a major relief. These are four people with superpowers -- shouldn't somebody be having a little fun?\n\nSteve O'Brien, Digital Spy:\n\nWhat they, and the series, needs to do is to loosen up a bit. It needn't go full Joss Whedon, but The Defenders needs to know it's not The Wire - it's a superhero team-up series, and it needn't feel shy about that.\n\nSusana Polo, Polygon:\n\nThe Defenders does a great job of reminding us not only where Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Danny Rand are, but also where their supporting casts are -- which is good, because in the case of some folks (like Jess and Trish and Malcom) we haven't seen them in two years and we need the refresher.\n\nMatt Webb Mitovich, TV Line:\n\nOutside of a rudimentary knowledge of each character's unique abilities, I'd only recommend a passing familiarity with DaredevilSeason 2, as relates to The Hand as an evil organization.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Spy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303104", "label": {"eng": "Digital Spy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304254", "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "313045", "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313996", "label": {"eng": "Geek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariah_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314428", "label": {"eng": "Mariah Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVLine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "334934", "label": {"eng": "TVLine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A.V._Club", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "337257", "label": {"eng": "The A.V.

The actor addresses fight choreography and the origin story. By Joshua Yehl\n\nWith Marvel's The Defenders debuting on Netflix tomorrow, we hopped on the phone with Finn Jones, the actor who plays Danny Rand aka Iron Fist. He gave us some insight on his character heading into the team-up show and also addressed a few sticking points about Danny Rand.\n\nDefenders is set about three months after the events of Iron Fist, and we first meet Danny in Cambodia where he's tracking down a member of the Hand. As you'll remember from the end of Iron Fist Season 1 (spoilers!), when Danny returned home to K'un L'un, the city had disappeared and some of his fellow monks were dead in the snow, the result of an assumed Hand attack.\n\n\"At the end of Iron Fist, Danny feels very guilty that he left his responsibilities, he ****ed up basically,\" Jones said. \"He realized how he allowed his own emotions and his own inner recklessness to get in the way of his responsibility and the result was the loss of his home and somewhere where he grew up for 15 years. He's being driven by guilt to take down the Hand, so we're seeing a much more purposeful and driven Danny at the beginning of Defenders.\"\n\nJones had previously revealed that the production schedule of Iron Fist Season 1 was so tight that he would often have to learn the fight choreography just before filming. Viewers noticed this, commenting how the fight scenes weren't on the level they'd expect from one of Marvel's premiere martial arts characters, but Jones asserts that things are much different in Defenders.\n\n\"By the time of Defenders, I had been working on the character and training for about seven months, on and off, so by Defenders I was a lot more well-trained than at the beginning of Iron Fist because I had been doing it for so long. The good thing about Defenders, because it was an ensemble piece I wasn't needed every single second of the day to shoot, which is often the case when you're leading your own individual show. At the beginning of [Defenders] when we're all separated, there was definitely days in the week where I didn't have to shoot. Because of that, I went in and got a chance to rehearse, spend days on choreography before we actually shot. But then as we all came together and our schedules became a lot tighter because of the shooting demands, there was often times, especially towards the end of the show where we were picking up choreography on the day of shooting. That's kind of a regular thing, that's just television scheduling. Unfortunately, it's just something we have to get used to,\" Jones said.\n\nThe combination of having more time to train and working with a different production crew than Iron Fist has Jones optimistic about how Danny will appear as an improved fighter in Defenders.\n\n\"I think the choreography is a lot slicker and I think the way it's been shot and edited is definitely a lot more cohesive [in Defenders]. I also think, just because I went from shooting six months of Iron Fist to immediately going on to shoot Defenders, just by nature of having all of that practice leading up to Defenders, the choreography felt a lot more grounded. It was a different choreography team and the way it was shot was a little bit different as well, and I think that definitely helped sell the fight scenes a lot better. And on top of that, I was more used to picking up choreography and the fluidity of the movements.\"\n\nJones also used his time on the phone with us to clear up what he sees as a common misconception about how viewers see Danny.\n\n\"It's a common misconception that Danny was 'the Chosen One' and he came from money. I know there's a lot of talk about Danny being very privileged and this and that, but I do think it's a common misconception that people are just seeing the character in very broad strokes. Danny, yes he grew up in a very wealthy family, but at 10 years old he was ripped out of an airplane, he lost both of his parents, and he had to grow up in a very desolate environment for 15 years. He had to train and work super hard to become the Iron Fist. It was never about him being 'the Chosen One.' He definitely didn't live a life of privilege from 10 years-old onward. He actually lived a very difficult life,\" Jones explained.\n\nEvery Character in The Defenders 10+ IMAGES Fullscreen Image Artboard 3 Copy Artboard 3 ESC 01 OF 18 Here's every major character confirmed so far for Marvel's The Defenders. 01 OF 18 Here's every major character confirmed so far for Marvel's The Defenders.

Up until the end of Iron Fist, Danny didn't even know what a superhero was. He had these responsibilities and he had this power, but he didn't know how to handle it. He was so caught up in his own trauma and his own grief, he kind of let the power run away from him for a little bit, the responsibility run away from him a bit. He wasn't well-equipped to handle it, which is why he ran away from K'un L'un, foolishly, and he definitely regrets that now,\" Jones said. \"Meeting these three heroes, they're a little bit older, they're probably about six or seven years older than him, and they're people with abilities and problems that still manage to keep their **** together and live a responsible and purposeful life. Danny is really in admiration of that, especially in admiration of Daredevil. He sees someone who is slightly tortured, who has difficulties, who hasn't had the perfect life, but yet he can use these abilities in a way which is responsible and can help the community and help other people. Danny sees these other three people and he's really inspired by what they are able to achieve, so it's like Danny meeting a bunch of older brothers and sister for the first time, and they're keeping him in check a little bit, and they give him a self-realization that he can do that as well.\"\n\nComic fans know that Iron Fist teams up with Luke Cage to form the superhero company Heroes for Hire, and Finn confirms that Defenders will indeed plant the seeds for it.\n\n\"What we're seeing is the birth of this iconic comic book bromance come to life on screen for the first time and it's super exciting,\" Jones said. \"I remember when I read the script, their scenes really stood out to me because [showrunner Marco Ramirez] did such a good job writing the scenes. It didn't feel cheesy or on the nose, it actually felt really relevant. It would have been so easy to just set it up and suddenly they're best buds from the get-go, but what I really admired about the way that they first meet is they don't see eye-to-eye. They come from very different backgrounds and there's conflict between them. It makes a really relevant relationship between the two.

We haven't seen too much of what the latter is capable of so far and the latest trailer for the series paints her in an intimidating light. We've seen each of the miniseries' superheroes debut in their own solo series before this - each making a stand against criminals in New York, taking advantage of the aftermath of The Avengers.\n\nNone of them have had an easy ride, with Matt Murdock losing Elektra and revealing his identity to Karen - he's 'kind of lost' when The Defenders begins. In truth, he's retired from his vigilante career, so it's going to take a very large threat to bring him back. Luke Cage will be in prison at the beginning, but as the show goes on, it will address the relationship between Luke and Jessica Jones. And as for Danny Rand, his story arc from Iron Fist season 1 will flow through into The Defenders.\n\nRelated: 15 Times Iron Fist Actually Did Something Awesome\n\nThe latest trailer gives an extremely vague outline of Alexandra's intentions, without actually detailing any of her plan for New York. It's made clear that it will involve The Hand and the newly-resurrected Elektra, but aside from that we're in the dark as much as the heroes are. The trailer begins by introducing the characters one by one as Sigourney Weaver's villain confronts them in the restaurant. This clearly takes place after they've met up, and after Stick has appeared. We know that Daredevil's mentor has a history with Alexandra after a clip was released earlier this week of the two, as the villain calls Stick \"Old friend\". And even though she might be a baddie, Alexander actually sees herself as a heroine.\n\nThe trailer also shows Alexandra walking in some kind of medical facility, something that could possibly connect to Elektra's resurrection. We know the latter will have amnesia during The Defenders, so she could have been hospitalized after returning from the dead. How Daredevil will react to seeing his ex-lover back from the dead will be interesting, given how their relationship played out back in Daredevil season 2. Alexandra will be preying on the 'connections' that each hero has, meaning that their friends and loved ones will be at risk. No change there, then.\n\nIt's made obvious that the Defenders are going to have to put aside their differences to battle Alexandra and The Hand - but by the end of their fight, they should be an efficient superhero team. At the end of the above trailer, we see Jessica Jones lightly making jokes out of Iron Fist and his powers. To be fair though, one shouldn't put Jessica on a team full of superpowered vigilantes and expect her to keep quiet.\n\nNEXT: The Defenders Shapes Marvel/Netflix Phase 2\n\nThe Defenders premieres August 18 on Netflix, followed by The Punisher sometime this fall. Premiere dates for the new seasons of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist have yet to be announced.\n\nSource: Netflix\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

The eight-part Netflix series wastes no time getting into the action, but is somewhat slow picking up steam.\n\nThe streaming giant has already introduced the characters in the series \"Jessica Jones,\" \"Luke Cage,\" \"Daredevil\" and \"Iron Fist.\" If you've seen them, then you know they each include complicated mythologies.\n\nIf you're not familiar with them, then watching their stories get pieced together in \"The Defenders\" can be a bit of a slog. There are already 60 episodes of the four series available on Netflix, so fans of these superheroes are likely to be more patient.\n\nTo varying degrees, I'm among the latter. So bringing together the band of misfits -- played by Krysten Ritter, Mike Colter, Charlie Cox, Finn Jones -- already piqued my interest, but it was the presence of Sigourney Weaver as the primary villain that really makes this series.\n\nWe first meet her character, Alexandra, a wealthy woman, getting the news she has a terminal illness and only has a short time to live.\n\nIt gives her a degree of sympathy, but we soon learn she heads a powerful criminal organization. Still, Weaver's character never comes across as simply evil. Alexandra is sophisticated, even sensitive, appreciates the arts, and as we see, a survivor.\n\nIn a way, the character is the linchpin that keeps the early episodes together as it cuts between the four superheroes' stories, which includes many of the secondary characters in the series such as Rosario Dawson as Claire Temple and Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing.\n\nIn the early episodes, Alexandra's ultimate aim is murky. Apparently, her organization is capable of causing massive devastation in NYC -- there is a taste of that early on -- but to what end? She's clearly not about destruction, and while Alexandra is an intriguing shadowy figure, articulating what she was after would have given more focus and urgency to the plot.\n\nOtherwise, it seems like the four superheroes are mostly doing their own thing in the early episodes. As we meet them, we're re-introduced to their quirky natures. Ritter's grumpy but nearly invincible Jessica Jones is a favorite, and the actress is able to convey a lot with just a look.\n\nNow that she is free of her nemesis from the first season -- the mind-control villain Kilgrave (David Tennant) -- \"The Defenders\" gives us a hint where she might be in Season 2, expected next year. (A little less rage and beginning to see past him.)\n\nThe others superheroes remain pretty true to form. Daredevil (Cox) is the blind lawyer Matt Murdock, who has deadly martial-arts skills but a prickly personality. The impenetrable Luke Cage (Colter) is the quiet, determined type, and Iron Fist (Jones) is billionaire Danny Rand whose special power is in the name.\n\nOf course, when they meet up they won't get along. That is practically a plot pre-requisite in these stories. These are types who don't work well with others. Only Danny wants to. It's amusing that some fans of this Marvel quartet find Iron Fist irritating, seeing him as not strong enough of a personality or picking on Jones' performance, which is quite solid.\n\nThe character is excitable at times, but that makes sense. Danny has been raised by mystical monks most of his life. So the nearly 30-year-old superhero is emotionally a teen at times. It's an interesting twist, especially when he is with three stoic types.\n\n(By the way, \"Iron Fist\" has been renewed for a second season.)\n\nSo his character doesn't hit the usual superhero marks. The problem with many superhero stories is that is all they do.\n\nLike the other shows, \"The Defenders\" inserts a bit of welcome grit into its story. The showrunners of the individual series have also been smart enough to bring in strong actors such as Tennant and Vincent D'Onofrio as villains.\n\nHaving Weaver on board is a superplus for \"The Defenders,\" and Ritter is always on fire.\n\nUndoubtedly, fans will analyze the series to death, but don't sweat it. It's a fine superhero adventure even if you don't know all the characters. Just go with it. It may not be super, but it gets in its hits.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311156", "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "379719", "label": {"eng": "David Tennant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "409370", "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "465006", "label": {"eng": "Scott Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Man", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "531012", "label": {"eng": "Purple Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Wing", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555508", "label": {"eng": "Colleen Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Henwick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "749745", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Henwick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1288996", "label": {"eng": "Claire Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

Netflix, as it's grown to become more and more of a major player in the modern TV universe, has grand plans of its own.\n\nNetflix started out, and took root and blossomed, by providing easy access to many of the movies and TV shows made by others. Then it began making its own TV series and movies. As those programs have succeeded wildly (starting with House of Cards) Netflix has gone all in on the original production front, to the point where it's now carpet-bombing Netflix subscribers with several new offerings a week.\n\nMeanwhile, other entertainment companies, such as CBS and Disney, are getting into the streaming business with their own services, and beginning to withhold their product from Netflix and other distributors.\n\nThat's why original programs are so important to the future of Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other such companies. It's also why Netflix, most aggressively, is making new series deals with David Letterman and current ABC producer superstar Shonda Rhimes -- and why it partnered with Marvel Comics so boldly, and with such long-range commitment, years ago.\n\nNetflix's plan with Marvel, from the start, was to take relatively minor or underused titles and heroes from the Marvel comic books, and star them in their own season-long TV series. Then, after that, to feature them together in The Defenders, in an all-star superhero team-up.\n\nMarvel used the same blueprint (with bigger heroes) in the movies, first launching Iron Man, Captain America and others, then showcasing them together as The Avengers. And Marvel's rivals at DC Comics did the same with Batman, Superman and, most recently, Wonder Woman, while planning a one-movie-fits-all Justice League adventure film.\n\nWith Netflix, the plan was to take four different Marvel heroes and give them their own 13-episode shows. All of them ended up in the same Hell's Kitchen turf in New York, but dramatically, not all these characters, or shows, were created equal. Jessica Jones and Daredevil were wonderful fantasy dramas about haunted heroes. Jessica had post-traumatic stress after being captured and manipulated by a mind-controlling villain. And Cox's Matt Murdock, the lawyer by day, and costumed Daredevil by night, was blind, with his remaining senses exponentially enhanced after childhood exposure to radiation.\n\nThese two shows had strong supporting casts and terrific villains, played by such actors as David Tennant and Vincent D'Onofrio. But compared to them, Luke Cage was minor-league, and Iron Fist a total washout. Gathered together under one new title, if these Defenders were Marx Brothers, Iron Fist would be Zeppo.\n\nBut The Defenders works, in part, precisely because the chemistry among characters doesn't, and because it's a group of loners who don't even decide to join forces until four episodes in. And those were all the episodes provided for preview, so I'm not sure where The Defenders is going.\n\nBut I know it starts well, by bringing back the strongest supporting characters and continuing plots from the previous Marvel Netflix shows, and by casting Sigourney Weaver as the new big, bad villain.\n\nThe real standouts in The Defenders are the same actors and characters who excelled in their own series: Ritter as Jessica Jones and Cox as Daredevil. When they finally meet, the results are electric. And then there's \u00c9lodie Yung's Elektra, an important character in this new series -- even though she died at the end of last season on Daredevil.\n\nBut figuring out who lives and dies is a tricky thing, in superhero stories and in the real-life battle for world TV domination. With The Defenders, Netflix is making another very bold, very smart move.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100, "id": 679, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 100, "id": 680, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 1010, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303365", "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "303371", "label": {"eng": "Batman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304900", "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "304933", "label": {"eng": "Superman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305649", "label": {"eng": "Wonder Woman's bracelets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305835", "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "306130", "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "309051", "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309419", "label": {"eng": "Iron Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333570", "label": {"eng": "Captain America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "379719", "label": {"eng": "David Tennant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx_Brothers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "386017", "label": {"eng": "Marx Brothers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "386870", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_D'Onofrio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "409376", "label": {"eng": "Vincent D'Onofrio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}]}

Cast as the anti-Avengers, this latest Netflix show underscores Marvel's ambitions and ability to wring value out of characters that aren't exactly household names.\n\nPerhaps inevitably, \"Defenders\" limps along a bit in the early going (four episodes were previewed), juggling not only its four superheroes -- Luke Cage (Mike Colter), Jessica Jones (Kristen Ritter), Danny Rand/Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Matt Murdock/Daredevil (Charlie Cox) -- but their assorted sidekicks from previous stand-alone adventures. Even for Marvel aficionados, that's a lot to process.\n\nHang in there, though, and the lines begin to intersect, as the heroes square off individually and eventually together against forces of the shadowy cabal known as the Hand, led here by the mysterious Alexandra, lustily played by Sigourney Weaver as if she's realizing a long-deferred dream to become a Bond villain.\n\nNotably, Daredevil is the only one who wears a costume in this bunch, and at least initially even he gets by simply strapping a scarf over his face. In classic Marvel fashion, there's also plenty of bickering among the heroes, with Cage at one point growling that he's \"not looking for super-friends,\" at not-so-veiled shot at Marvel rival DC.\n\nFrankly, given their serialized nature all the Marvel shows would benefit from slightly shorter orders than 13-episode seasons, and based on the leisurely pace at the outset that's probably the case here as well.\n\nYet with so many personalities, it's kind of fun watching them learn about each other's powers, somewhat lightening the brooding tone that has characterized the Marvel-Netflix collaboration. Even Iron Fist -- the one genuine dud among the previous shows -- benefits from his interplay with the others, particularly the hard-as-rock Cage, who discovers what happens (in slow motion, naturally) when Iron Fist meets immovable object.\n\nThe producers have also done a good job casting around the leads, and it's welcome to see Scott Glenn back as Daredevil's crusty mentor, Stick; and Rosario Dawson as Claire, who has crossed paths with both Luke Cage and Daredevil.\n\nFor all its gaudy theatrical success, Marvel's TV track record has been more uneven, and the Netflix shows -- dark, gritty, really more detective dramas than traditional superhero fare -- have represented a bright spot. \"Defenders\" has also audaciously mirrored the company's original feature strategy, introducing a number of characters (beginning with \"Iron Man\") that were designed to build toward -- and heighten anticipation for -- a promised team-up.\n\nNobody will confuse the martial-arts-tinged action in \"Defenders\" with the pyrotechnics in Marvel's upcoming Avengers sequel \"Infinity War.\" But in its own way the series proves there's something to be said for waging smaller-scale battles.

(Netflix/File)\n\nRiding the slipstream of the Avengers, X-Men and Fantastic Four, \"The Defenders\" is promising to bring a more tortured and cerebral superhero vibe to Netflix's ever-growing repertoire of Marvel series.\n\nThe show unites for the first time the titular characters from the streaming service's four standalone Marvel series -- \"Luke Cage,\" \"Iron Fist,\" \"Jessica Jones\" and \"Daredevil\" -- when it premieres on Friday.\n\nThey join forces to battle a threat to their home town of New York in the shape of the malign Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver), who seems to be linked to the shady multinational conglomerate known as The Hand.\n\nBut the group starts out as a tenuous alliance between four very different characters, all of whom are used to going it alone and have little time for the concept of team spirit.\n\nThe group's first meeting doesn't augur well for things to come, with Luke Cage and Danny Rand -- alias the Iron Fist -- even coming to blows.\n\nActress Krysten Ritter says Jones, a young woman with a tortured past, a penchant for booze and a colorful vocabulary, is \"very reluctant\" in particular to be part of a team.\n\n\"Everybody's so used to working on their own, they all feel that their way is the best way,\" said Mike Colter, who plays Cage, at a roundtable with journalists in New York.\n\n\"So sometimes each one of us gets really determined to force our way of doing things because it's the only way we know.\"\n\nWhat persuades the four heroes to band together, says Colter, has to be something really big -- a danger to \"a larger number of people than just the people of Harlem\" that threatens the whole city.\n\nRead also: Marvel's 'The Defenders' trailer features street superhero team-up\n\n'Character first, drama first'\n\nFilmed entirely in the Big Apple, \"The Defenders\" is steeped in the culture and custom of New York, a real-life backdrop that feels more organic than the fictional cities of Gotham or Metropolis.\n\n\"Historically, some people shot other places for New York. To some degree it's effective when you deal with people that have never been to New York,\" said Colter, 40.\n\n\"But if you've been to New York, you immediately can tell. New York is very important because I think it symbolizes a sort of freedom to the world.\"\n\n\"The Defenders\" is distinguished from many superhero series and movies in the time it takes to explore the internal conflicts that haunt each of its heroes.\n\nJessica Jones, in particular, is struggling to find her place in the world, scarred by \"traumas and injustices\" after losing her parents in a car accident, says Ritter, 35.\n\nWhen they are brought together, each of the four Defenders is in transition, without a superhero costume, in search of an identity.\n\n\"I built (Jones) from the ground up, based on her back story, on what she's been through in her life and how she views the world -- with a little sense of humor on top of it to lighten things up,\" said Ritter.\n\nShe added that she sees Jones as \"a character who has super powers\" rather than as a superhero.\n\n\"For me, it's character first, drama first. I just approach it like I would any other acting part.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217579"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303413", "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "317651", "label": {"eng": "X-Men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "331759", "label": {"eng": "Fantastic Four"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}]}

Don't get me wrong, I know Agents of Shield still has a huge following, but I stopped watching the Netflix shows during the second season of Daredevil. And FX's Legion was just... okay for me. It's not that I don't love Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, but it's not fair to put lower-tier characters like them in competition with a juggernaut like Watchmen.\n\nHBO was clearly taking notes when Netflix started releasing their shows, so this seems like a great moment for Marvel to take some notes on their competition. If DC is going to churn out a Watchmen series, then Marvel needs to dig deep into their libraries to find stories worthy of being brought to the silver screen.\n\nSo hit Next to find out about five properties Marvel should consider adapting if they want to match HBO's Watchmen.\n\nPrevious1 of 6Next\n\nVIEW IN GALLERY", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt":

In the Netflix corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, The Defenders brings together Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter), and Iron Fist (Finn Jones), who team up to take down the Hand, the secret cabal of ninjas who seek control of New York City. With 8.5 million lives at stake, four loners from very different backgrounds must work together to save the day. But that's on TV. How did their comics go?\n\nCreated by Roy Thomas but named by Stan Lee in Marvel Feature #1 in 1971, the Defenders came together as a makeshift superhero team whose founding members -- Namor the Sub-Mariner, Doctor Strange, and the Incredible Hulk -- all met simply because their paths crisscrossed. The only thing they had in common is that they'd all prefer to work alone, and reluctantly they banded together to protect the planet against Lovecraft ripoffs known as the Undying Ones. When they officially took on the name \"Defenders,\" their first mission was to fight the techno wizard Yandroth.\n\nUnlike the TV show, the Defenders weren't preoccupied with \"street crime.\" Nor did they even have a stable membership. Over the years, the Defenders' roster changed frequently with a roster that sometimes included heroes like Ghost Rider, War Machine, Captain America, the Silver Surfer, and even Valkyrie, a powerful hero from Asgard who will be played by Tessa Thompson in Thor: Ragnarok. Since you don't send an Asgardian to fight petty criminals, the Defenders actually fought supernatural and mystic threats; it was up to the Avengers to take care of everything else.\n\nIt wasn't until the Netflix shows began when the Defenders shifted into a ground-level defense force. With the popularity of the Netflix shows, Marvel released in early 2017 a new ongoing series titled The Defenders that closely resembles the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nWith the same four heroes, Bendis envisioned these new Defenders in a city-wide crime saga, which he compared to The Godfather. \"I wanted to do a sprawling, Godfather-like epic at the street level of the Marvel Universe,\" Bendis told The Hollywood Reporter when the comic was first announced. Bendis hoped the book would be \"a modern, elaborate organized crime story that is different than what has gone before\" and that he would put them \"in the hardest battle for the street that anyone can imagine.\"\n\nWith about five issues in, Bendis has more or less lived up to that promise, with Frank Castle, aka the Punisher (also gearing up for his own Netflix series) being their most formidable opponent yet. Issue #6 of The Defenders, which will hit shelves in October, will prominently feature Deadpool as a guest character.\n\nBut while the Defenders in the comics look more like they do on TV, there are still some key differences. Luke Cage and Jessica Jones are dressed like their TV counterparts -- Cage has his yellow hoodie, Jessica has her casual leather jacket -- but Daredevil has his sleeker, slimmer spandex costume, which he's worn since the aftermath of Secret Wars. Iron Fist, meanwhile, is also wearing a new costume, a green tracksuit that riffs on the yellow onesie that Bruce Lee wore in his final movie, The Game of Death. On TV, only Daredevil has a costume. Iron Fist, mysteriously, still does not have one.\n\nOn TV, the Defenders are a no-nonsense group who would be overpowered against Chitauri or all-powerful gods with Infinity Stones. It's why it's unlikely they'll team up with their more bombastic colleagues in Avengers: Infinity War, but there's enough chaos right at home that will keep them busy.", "date": "2017-08-17",

Since the creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, few of the Marvel TV titles have received quite the same level of hype and critical acclaim around them as the first two seasons of Daredevil did. After finally bringing a faithful version of Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) to the screen, Daredevil went on to do the same thing with both Jon Bernthal's Frank Castle/The Punisher and Elodie Yung's Elektra in its subsequent sophomore season.\n\nNow, Cox is set to reprise his role as Daredevil again in Netflix's upcoming miniseries event, The Defenders, where he will be teaming up for the first time with Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter), and Danny Rand/Iron Fist (Finn Jones). But fortunately, fans won't have to wait much longer after that before Daredevil returns for season 3 after the series was renewed again at San Diego Comic-Con in 2016.\n\nRelated: The Defenders Gets a Final Trailer\n\nBut much to the confusion of fans, details regarding the story and production of Daredevil season 3 have been curiously lacking over the past few months. However, MCU Exchange is reporting that Daredevil season three will begin filming in New York sometime in the latter half of October, around the same time as Halloween. Whether or not that holiday will play into the setting or time frame of the new Daredevil season, though, is not yet known.\n\nIt's not much of a surprise that Marvel and Netflix have held off on beginning shooting for Daredevil's third season so far this year. As it is, the two companies are already busy enough right now, with production on both Jessica Jones season 2 and Luke Cage season 2 having been underway for several months now. When taking into account some previous comments about Daredevil season 3, it was also somewhat expected that Marvel and Netflix were going to be premiering the new seasons of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones first.\n\nAt the same time, the new seasons of Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil, and Iron Fist are all expected to be premiering over the next year, which means that production on the latter two would have to begin sometime within the next few months. Currently, not much is known about what to expect from the new seasons of any of those shows either, and very little likely will be until after The Defenders is released at the end of this week. There's no telling how that team-up event may change/alter the arcs of the main four Defenders - Matt Murdock included - and how exactly the next season of Daredevil does or does not pick up from where The Defenders leaves off, will have to wait to be seen.\n\nNEXT: Netflix's 2018 Marvel Lineup Revealed?\n\nMarvel's The Defenders premieres on August 18, followed by The Punisher season 1 later this fall. Premiere dates for the new seasons of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist have yet to be announced.\n\nSource: MCU Exchange\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

Pretty much every character already has another solo season on the way, plus they're adding The Punisher into the mix for good measure. So whatever creative form those seasons take, they'll be influenced by the fallout of The Defenders.\n\nHere's an excerpt from Jones' comments:\n\n\"[It] feels like the end of Phase One [and] the beginning of another phase. Let's just say there are certain events that happen at the end of The Defenders which are going to rock everyone's world. So people aren't going to be the same after the end of The Defenders.\"\n\nThe first four episodes of The Defenders released to critics have gotten solid reviews (I can also attest that it's pretty good), and it looks like the miniseries is shaping up to do a solid job of bringing all these characters together into one story.

Having served as showrunner on Daredevil Season 2, which had the added pressure of introducing Elektra and The Punisher to Matt Murdock's world, he was a natural fit for the culmination of Marvel's Netflix efforts, the superhero team-up The Defenders.\n\nAs part of our behind the scenes look at what went into making the show, we spoke with Mr. Ramirez by phone about the challenges of taking four characters, each capable of headlining their own series, and bringing them together in a way that remains true to all the hard work that has come before.\n\nOne thing that I am trying to figure out just for my own frame of reference here... How far after the end of Iron Fist does this take place? I know these are all kind of in real time, but roughly where are these?\n\nI know that Marvel has a very strict chronology of when all these shows have happened and how they've happened, but we just say weeks to months. So that Danny and Colleen could have been on their quest for a couple of months [and] we could assume that Matt Murdock has had some time to decompress after all the Elektra stuff in Daredevil season 2 and \"coming out\" to Karen. So yeah, we've been saying months, or weeks to months.\n\nWhen did you learn you has the showrunner gig for The Defenders? Were you still doing Daredevil season 2?\n\nStill in the final movements of Daredevil season 2, yeah. It was somewhere around shooting the finale and editing the finale. Jeph Loeb kind of presented the opportunity, and it had to be kept secret for a little bit. It was fun to get cast questions and to not be able to answer. That was kind of fun. It's kind of like planning a surprise party.\n\nDaredevil is a main thread for The Defenders. Were you aware of some of the things that were going to have to get picked up in The Defenders even before you got the showrunner's gig?\n\nMarvel had a sense of all the threads that would need to be picked up from Iron Fist. I think Luke Cage was in the process where they were still writing the last couple episodes, so the writers for The Defenders got to see the first couple episodes of Luke Cage before they came out so [the writers] got a good sense of who Mike [Colter] was and how Luke sounded, and what his world was.\n\nMarvel didn't have story specifics in terms of what needed to happen in Defenders. It was more like, you know, kind of opening a curtain and saying, \"This is what's happening on these other shows because you absolutely need to know.\" But ideally, I feel like we're carrying over everybody's stories into the next chapter, so this should also feel like Luke Cage season 1.5, and Jessica Jones season 1.5 to a certain degree. So it's not like everyone is guest starring in one other person's show, but rather like all four of them coming together.\n\nYeah, and it does feel like that. I was amazed by how in the first episode each of those little sections reintroduces everyone. It's like Daredevil season 2, episode 13a. Did you go to the other showrunners for advice as well?\n\nYeah, I mean they were around. A lot of it was obviously through Marvel, who kind of funneled everything back with a lot of information. But yeah, it really helps geographically that we're all in the same building. So, you know, I developed a friendship with [Luke Cage showrunner] Cheo Coker, so it was nice to be able to just walk over to Cheo and ask him questions about Luke, and what Misty would sound like, and how Luke would interact, and that kind of stuff. So it was good that we would just weirdly be on this campus where we're all making stuff from the same DNA, just to make sure that we weren't contradicting stories or repeating stories. We wanted to make sure everyone was on the up and up.\n\nHow long did it take you to figure out an organic way to bring everybody together?\n\nA couple of months, to be frank. But I will say one of the first things I think I knew was that we had to take our time. One of the great benefits of working on a Netflix show is because they release all the episodes at the same time, there's the ultimate promise to the audience to just stay with us, we're getting there. We'll get to the stuff you came for. There was never any rush to get there so that they would have to, you know, \"Tune in next week so that, as promised, you get all your people together.\" It really felt like we could use the format as a way to tell the story really organically, and so the slow burn of it, and the slow mixing of ingredients, that was -- I didn't know how, but I knew that's what we needed to do.\n\nIt also felt like we need to do the two different threads first. You know, where JJ and Matt meet, and Danny and Luke meet, and then we fold those together. So it felt like we're mixing ingredients together slowly and organically, rather than having them all recruited by someone saying, \"You all need to work together now\" in episode one. That's not -- maybe that's spoilery to talk about -- but that felt like not the right way to tell this story. These characters needed to get there on their own as opposed to being told, \"This is happening.\" Jessica Jones has so much agency, Luke Cage has such a drive, Matt Murdock is so complicated. Everyone's just so unique. It just felt wrong to get them all on the same page and not make that part of the story. We need to eventually get them all on the same page versus they're all on the same page 20 minutes in.\n\nI know everybody kind of expects when these team ups happen -- because of the Avengers movies and because of what happens on the CW shows -- when they happen, they automatically become bigger. So far, you've done a real good job of keeping it grounded in this corner of the universe. But does that scale increase as we go forward? Was there any pressure to bring a certain amount of spectacle later in the series?\n\nThere is only in terms of of the promise of excitement as you reach a climax, but that's just storytelling 101. I worked on Sons of Anarchy for two years, and it felt like we got our bloodiest episodes at the end of a season, you know? So that was where that happened. But here, I really think, yeah. To a certain degree, sure, it gets a little bit bigger as it opens. But really, in terms of spectacle and scale, these are really character-centered shows and really grounded ones. And so, you know, the biggest things that might happen in later episodes are the characters making big decisions.\n\nWe don't fight in the sky on this show. These stories happen in the back alleys of New York, so in a weird way, when we talk about spectacle as really fun stuff to get to, in some case, it was as simple as, \"Oh my god, I can't wait to use this needle drop on the scene.\" Or, \"Oh my god, I can't wait for these two people to finally see each other, or these people to finally address that thing.\" It wasn't always about special effects, spectacles, and big bombastic fight scenes. Sometimes, it was just about moments you know that the audience have been waiting for that we would finally give them in the last couple of episodes. You know, a certain team-up or a certain nod to the comics in a big way that people may have been waiting for for several seasons. That felt just as big as something practically big, like cars exploding or stuff getting thrown around.\n\nI know there's probably not a lot you can say about the villain, but how did you end up casting Sigourney Weaver?\n\nI mean, it never happens this way. It never happens that a team of writers sits around and spit balls a character and come up with a character, and thinks, \"Okay, this is a Sigourney Weaver type.\" And then talks about it like that for several months, and eventually, Marvel and Netflix say \"Sigourney's on the phone. She wants to talk about the character.\" So just in terms of that process, it was kind of surreal to have thought about her -- I think we even had her headshot up on the wall. Whenever we referenced the character, we would talk about and point to that thing, so eventually, when I was on the phone with her talking about the role, it suddenly felt like... Not only has my life long dream come true of working with Ripley, it's also, that was a character we've been talking about for so long, if you want to, you know, talk about her and how to make her interesting and three dimensional. So really, it was one of those dream scenarios.\n\nWe talked about this character a Sigourney Weaver type. We never expected to get Sigourney Weaver on the line, and much less on set. So I think we were all excited. The writers were all excited. The directors, I'm sure they're all thrilled about the cast as well.\n\nThe Marvel Netflix shows have been immune to that larger Marvel \"curse\". People say, \"Well, you know, the villain's not really strong enough in the Marvel movies.\" You can't say that about Kilgrave or Kingpin.\" So where does Sigourney's Alexandra fit on this spectrum?\n\nThe villains...it's even tricky to call them villains. Something I noticed when working on Daredevil Season 1, we never really talked about Fisk as being bad. He was just this other character who wanted another version of New York. I think you could probably say that about Cottonmouth in some capacity on Luke Cage, although Kilgrave is most definitely a villain.\n\nI really think it's just that TV is different than film, and in TV, scenes are king, not massive fights or big spectacle, or costume, or anything like that. It's really just about ultimately what people do in scenes. And so when you think about what I think about -- the most proud that we did with Fisk season one of Daredevil, they're scenes. When I think about the things I love most about Kilgrave and about Cottonmouth, it's always come down to great scenes, great monologues, great moments. People just making really great decisions. And so it's not hard, I don't think, to just automatically by default think about those characters as really sophisticated characters first, and not what kind of superpower does so and so have. Even Kilgrave's power is relatively grounded, because it's ultimately this mental sophisticated thing.\n\nIn the Netflix world, they constantly encouraged us to go with more and more sophisticated cable drama with the characters, with who we'd call villains or antagonists. We've just always been encouraged to make them as complicated as possible. This is the network that gave us House of Cards. They're not interested in black and white villains. They really want everyone to feel really complicated and interesting. So that's the promise.\n\nI'll be frank, I think that was part of the allure, I think, to someone like Sigourney. She was very excited by the idea of joining the Kilgraves and the Fisks of the Marvel Universe. She was very excited at the thought of being one of these really smart, sophisticated, manipulative, powerful people who doesn't have to use what we would consider comic book supervillain tropes to get what they want. And it ultimately comes down to scenes. And I think that's what she responded to. So I hope that somehow answers that question.\n\nI guess it does? [Laughs] And this is an original character, right?\n\nAlexandra is a character that's... You know what? I can't answer that question.\n\nOkay, fair enough. So this has to go into production right after Iron Fist wrapped, right? Were you guys already connecting the dots? How long of a lead time in terms of pre-production and things like that? This is a very challenging project.\n\nYeah, it was very challenging. The great part is that we were able to carry over a lot of the Marvel crew from previous shows. So a lot of the crew that were on these shows just kind of roll from one into the other, so they're very familiar with the world, they're very familiar with the system, and they're very familiar with the secrecy of how we have to shoot in New York. I believe almost everyone has worked in the Marvel-Netflix world. Our heads of departments have all worked there before. Seeing how they kind of roll from the Iron Fist production right into ours, and then similarly at the very end of production, Krysten Ritter had to roll right from the end of Defenders right into Jessica Jones Season 2. It's very much like the trains are moving. People, get on them. I think a lot of our crew came right after either Iron Fist or Luke Cage Season 1.\n\nDaredevil Season 2 was pretty large scale. When you factor in characters like Elektra and Punisher, that's almost like having two more leads the way you have four leads here. Was this a tougher production? Is there more pressure on you from Marvel, for example, because this is the thing they've been building to?\n\nIt was different. In some ways, Daredevil Season 2 felt like a dry run to what Defenders really was. Some of the exciting challenges in Daredevil Season 2 were that we were kind of creating Elektra and Frank Castle in that world. We were casting them. We were figuring out what their voices sounded like. We were doing a lot of that, and that was really exciting. Some of the similar but different challenges in Defenders was that these characters already existed. They were already casted. Their voices were already distinct. The actors certainly have really good senses of who they were. So it was a little different in terms of -- I wasn't creating Jessica Jones, or Luke Cage, or Danny Rand. They already exist on their own shows. I was just seeing where those voices fit into this world and how those voices sounded when they bounce off each other. So they're very different.\n\nOn one hand, yeah, it was nice to have Daredevil Season 2. On the other hand, it was a lot of... I jokingly called it leasing the car. I lease Luke Cage for the episodes, and I had to turn him right back in to Cheo to go do season 2. I leased Jessica Jones so I could turn her back in and [Jessica Jones showrunner] Melissa [Rosenberg] could give her a great story.\n\nWhat kind of input from Marvel do you get?\n\nIt's interesting the stuff that's very important versus the stuff that they're open to hear new ideas on. That is really interesting. And of course, between the Jeph Loebs and the Joe Quesadas of the world, you have these comic book geniuses who are legends. I grew up reading their comics, so whenever they have notes on how Matt Murdock would do something, I listen real close.\n\nBut on the other hand, I'm taking a character and giving them a new rhyme or a new spin. I'm writing for a new medium, so those conversations have been interesting and exciting in terms of this is how such and such thing would work best in the comics. And the TV writers have to say, \"In this art form, this is how to best tell that story or how to best serve it.\" So it's been an interesting dance between how established and what the audience think, what the audience love about it, and the new medium. And on top of that, this kind of new realm that Netflix has given us to play -- these sophisticated characters driven stories -- the super powers are kind of one of the last things that you take into account on these shows. It's really about the characters and who the people are. The superpowers and the origins, that all comes way, way later on the importance scale, I think.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(U.S._TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304814", "label": {"eng": "House of Cards (U.S. TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306566", "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW_Television_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "310192", "label": {"eng": "The CW Television Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311297", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313307", "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervillain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "318518", "label": {"eng": "Supervillain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "333571", "label": {"eng": "Civil War (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "342245", "label": {"eng": "Punisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Anarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345207", "label": {"eng": "Sons of Anarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeph_Loeb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "408147", "label": {"eng": "Jeph Loeb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingpin_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "437318", "label": {"eng": "Kingpin (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Man", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "531012", "label": {"eng": "Purple Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottonmouth_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "599148", "label": {"eng": "Cottonmouth (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)The product of meticulous planning, \"Marvel's The Defenders\" starts slowly but rewards patience, gradually uniting its \"street level\" heroes against a somewhat amorphous but bigger-than-any-one-can-handle threat. Cast as the anti-Avengers, this latest Netflix show underscores Marvel's ambitions and ability to wring value out of characters that aren't exactly household names.\n\nPerhaps inevitably, \"Defenders\" limps along a bit in the early going (four episodes were previewed), juggling not only its four superheroes -- Luke Cage (Mike Colter), Jessica Jones (Kristen Ritter), Danny Rand/Iron Fist (Finn Jones), and Matt Murdock/Daredevil (Charlie Cox) -- but their assorted sidekicks from previous stand-alone adventures. Even for Marvel aficionados, that's a lot to process.Hang in there, though, and the lines begin to intersect, as the heroes square off individually and eventually together against forces of the shadowy cabal known as the Hand, led here by the mysterious Alexandra, lustily played by Sigourney Weaver as if she's realizing a long-deferred dream to become a Bond villain.Notably, Daredevil is the only one who wears a costume in this bunch, and at least initially even he gets by simply strapping a scarf over his face. In classic Marvel fashion, there's also plenty of bickering among the heroes, with Cage at one point growling that he's \"not looking for super-friends,\" at not-so-veiled shot at Marvel rival DC.\" allowfullscreen>Frankly, given their serialized nature all the Marvel shows would benefit from slightly shorter orders than 13-episode seasons, and based on the leisurely pace at the outset that's probably the case here as well.Read MoreYet with so many personalities, it's kind of fun watching them learn about each other's powers, somewhat lightening the brooding tone that has characterized the Marvel-Netflix collaboration. Even Iron Fist -- the one genuine dud among the previous shows -- benefits from his interplay with the others, particularly the hard-as-rock Cage, who discovers what happens (in slow motion, naturally) when Iron Fist meets immovable object.The producers have also done a good job casting around the leads, and it's welcome to see Scott Glenn back as Daredevil's crusty mentor, Stick; and Rosario Dawson as Claire, who has crossed paths with both Luke Cage and Daredevil.For all its gaudy theatrical success, Marvel's TV track record has been more uneven, and the Netflix shows -- dark, gritty, really more detective dramas than traditional superhero fare -- have represented a bright spot. \"Defenders\" has also audaciously mirrored the company's original feature strategy, introducing a number of characters (beginning with \"Iron Man\") that were designed to build toward -- and heighten anticipation for -- a promised team-up.Nobody will confuse the martial-arts-tinged action in \"Defenders\" with the pyrotechnics in Marvel's upcoming Avengers sequel \"Infinity War.\" But in its own way the series proves there's something to be said for waging smaller-scale battles. By shrewdly using Netflix to showcase and cash in on these lesser-known properties, Marvel once again appears to be winning the war.\"Marvel's The Defenders\" premieres Aug. 18 on Netflix.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304269", "label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Messenger", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "308970", "label": {"eng": "Facebook Messenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309419", "label": {"eng": "Iron Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "311156", "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "409370", "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "465006", "label": {"eng": "Scott Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "569522", "label": {"eng": "Stick (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1177719", "label": {"eng": "TV track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

To some degree it's effective when you deal with people that have never been to New York,\" said Colter (40).\n\n\"But if you've been to New York, you immediately can tell. New York is very important because I think it symbolises a sort of freedom to the world.\"\n\nThe Defenders is distinguished from many superhero series and movies in the time it takes to explore the internal conflicts that haunt each of its heroes.\n\nREAD: Comic Con hits: Black Panther & Batman\n\nJessica Jones, in particular, is struggling to find her place in the world, scarred by \"traumas and injustices\" after losing her parents in a car accident, says Ritter (35).\n\nWhen they are brought together, each of the four Defenders is in transition, without a superhero costume, in search of an identity.\n\n\"I built (Jones) from the ground up, based on her back story, on what she's been through in her life and how she views the world - with a little sense of humour on top of it to lighten things up,\" said Ritter.\n\nShe added that she sees Jones as \"a character who has super powers\" rather than as a superhero.\n\n\"For me, it's character first, drama first.

So you'll probably be able to determine whether or not it's the sort of thing you're going to enjoy from the jump.\n\nMarvel's Netflix shows have all veered far more grim and moody than their big screen counterparts, and some have wrestled admirably with real societal issues like racism and misogyny.\n\nThe Defenders doesn't abandon that, but it's trying to be comic book-y fun in a way that its forebearers weren't. It doesn't always succeed, but it largely does, and goes a long ways toward restoring faith in a series that's made some recent blunders.\n\nWhile Marvel's Netflix shows have ranged from stupid (Iron Fist) to sublime (Jessica Jones), one flaw all the previous entries shared is a pacing so deliberate it veered into dullness. Defenders' showrunners Douglas Petrie (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Marco Ramirez (Orange Is the New Black) have clearly learned from those mistakes.\n\nThis show, which brings Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Kristyn Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) together into one, street-level, super-powered team-up is a lean beast. At a slender eight episodes, a lot of the melodrama, flashbacks and wheel-spinning that hobbled the previous shows has been trimmed away here so it can get right to the good stuff.\n\nThe good stuff in question mostly concerns a mysterious aristocrat named Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver), who is consorting with a lot of the leftover villains from the other shows and is clearly up to something, though the show is mighty cagey about what.\n\nYou need look no further than Iron Fist for an example of how fatally the \"villain-with-an-ambiguous-evil-scheme\" trope can trip up a narrative, but it works well here, largely on the strength of Weaver. She's found a nice late-career niche playing sinister villains and can add her performance to Marvel's Netflix-verse roster of impressively memorable bad guys.\n\nThe first few episodes set the table with aplomb. We catch up with Luke Cage, who manages an early release from prison with the help of a lawyer who will be familiar to fans of these shows. Iron Fist is traveling the world with Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) taking out members of menacing magic ninja club The Hand. There's Matt Murdoch, whose legal career is finally gaining some traction even as he's retired from the superhero business following the events of his own most recent season. And finally Jessica Jones, who I'm happy to report is in the exact same place we left her, wrestling to both keep her private eye career afloat and hangovers at bay, and not having a lot of success with either.\n\nCox, Ritter and Colter remain interesting performers across the board. Colter's a born star, with a magnetism that makes his good guy shtick much more compelling than it'd be in the hands of a less engaging presence.\n\nIt's a treat to see Ritter return to the leather jackets, scarves and fingerless gloves again; her character isn't quite like anything else on television, with furtive glances and desperate gambles revealing some worrisome cracks in her smart-alecky veneer. And Cox does a good job shouldering some of this series' heaviest lifting, painting a compelling portrait of a man guilted into goodness by a tortured, Roman Catholic conscience that just won't allow him to abide inaction.\n\nThat leaves Finn Jones' Iron Fist. One of the big questions going in was how showrunners would deal with Jones, whose own show was a critical flop. While Jones' performance still lacks the dexterity of his colleagues (some of the dialogue with Hardwick comes off particularly wooden), The Defenders makes some smart moves in how Iron Fist bounces off his new super pals.\n\nOf particular note is his partnership with Luke Cage, which starts off begrudgingly and slowly moves to respect. Early on, Luke Cage calls Iron Fist out for failing to recognize the way his own privilege and apathy contributes to the crime and violence he wants to fight against. When Iron Fist argues that he's trained to become a martial arts master, Cage counters with \"you had power the day you were born.\" After Iron Fist was rightly criticized for racial insensitivities, using the character's well-established comic book friendship with one of Marvel's most prominent black superheroes to directly confront systemic racism is a bold, smart move.\n\nAnother bold move was frontloading a lot of the side characters from these heroes' respective shows. The danger with all these big superhero mashups is an overstuffed roster, but The Defenders has the benefit of being able to pull from four separate television shows with well-established tertiary characters to organically move its narrative forward.\n\nWhat's especially welcome is the number of non-white males in this cast. There's Iron Fist's aforementioned partner Colleen Wing, who was one of his show's consistently non-bad things. Jones' friends Tricia (Rachel Taylor) and Malcolm (Eka Darville) are on hand to assist her in a missing person investigation that starts to uncover a lot more than she bargained for. Murdoch's former secretary Karen (Deborah Ann Woll) is chasing down leads in her new gig as a journalist. Luke's police contact/sometimes romantic partner Misty Knight (Simone Missick) points him in the direction of some bizarre homicides. And of course, Rosario Dawson's Claire Temple remains this mini-universe's common thread and one of its more compelling features.\n\nIn an age where superhero franchises continue to struggle with representation, The Defenders refreshingly clears the Bechdel Test with ease and features a cast that looks nearly as diverse as the city the show is set in. That's a welcome shift from the norm, and it serves the show well.\n\nAt their best, superhero shows are about the extreme lengths we have to go to be a good person in difficult times. Iron Fist, Jessica Jones, Daredevil and Luke Cage may have some low-level super powers, but they're still a more relatable breed of hero than the high-flying, whizz-bang glory hounds like Thor and Iron Man.\n\nFor the most part, the Defenders are just people who find themselves forced to the frontlines of dire circumstances. It's not at all hard to imagine any of them just sitting the fight out and waiting for one of the a-listers to show up (indeed, a few of them try) or justifying actions of bad people to excuse their own apathy.\n\nIt's not exactly a spoiler to say our heroes rise to the challenge (or, at least, they do in the first four episodes that were made available to critics). By showcasing the value of diversity, the necessity of good people standing up to evil, and the heroism that can come of banding together against injustice, The Defenders feels relevant in ways the creators couldn't have predicted during its production.\n\nYou'll find plenty of viewers -- and even more critics -- who say they've reached the point of superhero adaptation exhaustion, and I'm sympathetic to the fact that it's just not everyone's cuppa. But art mirrors culture and, currently, the United States' most lucrative, popular artistic output is a genre that began as fanciful depiction of fighting Nazis, and has been dedicated to the notion that good people can fight back against wickedness ever since.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri":

I got a phone call from Jeph Loeb (exec VP and head of television at Marvel) before we showed up for the reveal at Comic Con in New York .\n\n\"That morning he called me and said 'Just so you know, there is going to be the four of you on stage and one other person and it will be Sigourney Weaver' and I was like 'Why? Why is she going to be on stage with us? Is she moderating?'\n\n\"He was like 'No, she's going to be in the show' so the first time I met her we were already on stage and she was called out and so I was like 'Hi' in front of 5,000 people.\n\n\"For an actor to meet someone like Sigourney Weaver is a big deal so I had an impulse and luckily nobody handed me the mic and I didn't get to do this but i had the impulse to say 'in Hell's Kitchen no-one hears you scream' which i thought would have been fun and cool.\n\n\"But it could have been offensive, I don't know.\"\n\nThe Defenders will continue the narrative timeline of all the Marvel shows on Netflix and showrunner Marco Ramirez said keeping the stories straight was a huge task.\n\nHe said: \"We had charts like mad people. We had charts of where JJ left off, charts of this is what is happened in Luke.\n\n\"When we started writing Iron First hadn't come out so it was just 'this is everything we think will happen on Iron Fist, this is what happened between seasons'.\n\n\"We even had a chart telling us what season it would be, whether it was winter or fall, every kind of grid, everything, we were like Claire Danes in Homeland, we were just sitting in front of these things popping pills looking at the walls, where is the show? That was the beginning.\"\n\nHe continued: \"When we started Defenders, the Iron Fist writers' room had just started so when we asked what happens in episode 13 they didn't know.\n\n\"We all had to play ball at the same time and figure out that is where it ends so this is what we can do.\"\n\nThe merging of storylines also presented challenges for Cox, who said: \"It is linear but the nature of the final episode of any TV series is there is some kind of climactic ending or something has happened or changed.\n\n\"With the end of season 2 of Daredevil I had my feelings and my ideas about what that had led him to do so there were important questions about how much time has passed? What has happened in that time? What had this character been up to? Have they carried on as normal or gone into hiding?\n\n\"And then you factor it in and keep that journey and trajectory authentic.\"\n\nThe Defenders starts streaming on Netflix on August 18.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Textiles", "wgt": 100, "id": 1561, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Textiles"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Kitchen,_Manhattan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217604"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302943", "label": {"eng": "Actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "314207", "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "346976", "label": {"eng": "Alien (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "352851", "label": {"eng": "Homeland (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Comic_Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "368594", "label": {"eng": "New York Comic Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Danes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "370157", "label": {"eng": "Claire Danes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeph_Loeb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "408147", "label": {"eng": "Jeph Loeb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}]}

The fact that it is a \"universe\" is fine for the aforementioned comic-book geeks, who know the origins of the various superheroes, but it can be confusing to the unenlightened.\n\nFortunately, you don't have to do homework to enjoy \"Marvel's The Defenders,\" a nicely crafted series premiering Friday on Netflix. The main characters do have origin stories, but you don't really have to know that Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) killed her nemesis, Kilgrave, at the end of \"Marvel's Jessica Jones.\" What you know is that she's moody, brilliant, not much in the warm and cuddly department, and the source of a steady stream of deadpan humor in \"The Defenders.\"\n\nJones is one of a quartet of Marvel characters who eventually team up to save New York City from destruction by an ages-old, worldwide occult network known as The Hand, headed by a very wealthy woman named Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver).\n\nIt takes four episodes for the team to come together, but don't worry: showrunner Marco Ramirez and his writing team build the story with heavy doses of dazzling action and compelling character development. For the cognoscenti, there are gentle reminders of backstories; for newbies, just enough to get a quick take on who's who and where they came from.\n\nThe other \"Defenders\" are Luke Cage (Mike Colter), newly released from prison and ready to return to being the Hero of Harlem; Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox), who is trying desperately to leave his alter-ego as Daredevil behind him; and Danny Rand (Finn Jones), the boy billionaire known as the Iron Fist. Alexandra has her own superheroine to make sure she achieves her goal of flattening Gotham, someone with personal ties to one of the Defenders.\n\nWeaver is great fun to watch, especially because her acting style is so carefully reserved in comparison to the actors playing \"The Defenders.\" It has to be said, though, that her character's taste in couture is really atrocious for someone who is supposed to be filthy rich. Most of her schmatas wouldn't make the former Home Shopping Network's 3 a.m. fire sale.\n\nOne asset of \"Marvel's The Defenders\" is that there's strength in numbers - not just in battle, but as characters. Iron Fist is the weakest link here, but because he is just a link, there are other characters who can do more of the heavy lifting. Whether you're a Universe denizen or a newbie, there's no heavy lifting in \"The Defenders\" for audience members either.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri":

Daredevil's Charlie Cox spoke with Den of Geek about the biggest difference he experienced in working with The Defenders executive producer Marco Ramirez, describing the experiences as \"very different\" than making Daredevil.\n\nRamirez served as executive producer for the second season and according to Cox, the major difference between work on Daredevil and The Defenders was the way Ramirez structured the story to fit with four diverse characters.\n\n\"So just in terms of structuring the story it's a completely different ball game. I was amazingly impressed by how he was able to take that and run with it. I can't even imagine what it was like for him to write this show with four characters, all whom already exist, three of whom you've ever written four,\" Cox said. \"All of those guys have other people who wrote their individual shows, and they've already created the characters he has to try and find the voice of that matches and what was already filmed and put on screen.\"\n\nCox also said that he personally experienced story-related challenges in making The Defenders, but not because of the expanded cast. For him the challenges surrounded by the introduction of the Hand and how to keep the life and death nature of the story real.\n\n\"I think the biggest challenge for me is when you introduce an organization like the Hand where there's any sort of ambiguity around how these people live and die, whether they can be exterminated, and all that kind of stuff, in order to keep that grounded and real, from an acting perspective, I find that really challenging. Because you also need to pay attention to the tone of the piece.\"\n\nWe'll get to see how the tone of the series came out when The Defenders hits Netflix on August 18.\n\nMarvel's The Defenders follows Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones). A quartet of singular heroes with one common goal - to save New York City. This is the story of four solitary figures, burdened with their own personal challenges, who realize they just might be stronger when teamed together.\n\nThe DefendersSunday at on Netflix ComicBook Composite 89.47 NAAll-Time Comic TV Shows Average rating Star Star Star Star Star 4.47/5 from 19 usersNAAll-Time Rated Full Profile\n\nby Nicole Drum | August 16, 2017", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "wgt": 100, "id": 245, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "314068", "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "386870", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Publishing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "480617", "label": {"eng": "Dennis Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

But you wouldn't know it to talk to Finn Jones, who was nothing but upbeat, cheerful, and chatty when we spoke with him by phone in May. The actor had a lot to feel good about. The Defenders had wrapped production, and he was waiting for word (now confirmed) that Marvel and Netflix would greenlight Iron Fist Season 2.\n\nMr. Jones told us about the mental and physical challenges of playing Danny Rand on his own show and in The Defenders, what he would like to see in Season 2, and much more.\n\nWere you prepared for the reaction that you got at New York Comic Con last year when The Defenders were united on stage for the first time? Because I've never seen anything like that at New York Comic Con.\n\nFinn Jones: So this is the situation. I think I was running on about three hours of sleep. We just wrapped season 1 of Iron Fist at, like, I think 9 AM that morning after six months of intense, intense shoot. And so, we've been working I think two solid weeks of night shoot solid leading up to it, and then on the last day, we wrapped it at like 8 PM, and then I had like three hours of sleep before I had to come in to do New York Comic Con.\n\nI remember just being thrown on the stage... I was watching footage back from the show -- You know, I've never seen footage back from the show before, and suddenly I'm in front of thousands of screaming people, watching the footage back for the first time, getting this reaction for the first time, then also meeting the other Defenders for the first time. And it was just like... [Laughs] It was very overwhelming and super intense. It was fun, but, you know when some just completely pound your senses, like sense overload? I was kind of numb to it all because I was just so tired by that point.\n\nSo, you couldn't have had a lot of time between when Iron Fist wrapped and when you had to go right into The Defenders, right?\n\nMaybe it was like a week and a half? A week and a half, two weeks? But then -- you know, you've got two weeks -- but then you're in prep for The Defenders anyway. I planned to go away and have a holiday. I kind of planned to do that in my head, and then after six months of intense shooting for Iron Fist, my body just shut down afterwards. So I needed a week to kind of recover and get back to normal. And then, by week two of my time off, I was already planning to go into costume fittings, table read-throughs, all that kind of stuff. So I pretty much went straight from Iron Fist into The Defenders. It wasn't really a break. Even though it was, it didn't feel like it.\n\nSince you're sharing this one with three other leads, was The Defenders a little less grueling?\n\nWell, I think everybody benefitted from that schedule, working on a schedule which is an ensemble piece because we have time to let the work breathe. We have time to prep the scene with more care, especially with the fight scenes. I had more time to rehearse because there were days in my schedule where I didn't have to be on set filming. On a regular show, you're working everyday, five days, sometimes six days a week. On this show, especially in the beginning, we kind of worked maybe three to four days a week? And obviously when we're all teamed up, then we're all together all of time, so it went back to a normal shooting schedule.\n\nBut for sure, especially for me, going from such an intense six months shoot to then go into The Defenders, which is a bit more spread out, it was definitely needed and it was definitely necessary. I think the work is just allowed to breathe a little bit more, especially since we shoot on such a tight time frame. We shoot one episode of television in around eight to nine days, which is really not a lot of time when you're trying to create the content that we are. So to be able to spread that out and breathe, I think, only helps the performances.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that you said you didn't have a lot of time to prep physically for those fight scenes in season 1 of Iron Fist. Can you tell me a little bit how that changed this time? What kind of martial arts styles are you working in?\n\nSo here's a kind of run down on how it works out. I got the role around end of February 2016, and then I was shooting at the end of March 2016. So I had a month from getting the role to actually being on camera. And within that time, I also had to go back to London, pack up all my stuff, say goodbye to everyone, move cities, get a visa. You know, do all of that admin and family stuff as well as going into training across two countries.\n\nSo I trained for about two weeks in Los Angeles, and that was just basic. It wasn't really any style, it was just kind of getting my body used to moving in that way, just being flexible and learn how to move properly. But really, two weeks there, and then I had a week in London where I was also scanning all my papers for my visa, before I moved to New York. Once I moved to New York, I spent a little bit more time in the studio preparing. We did a lot more like Tai Chi, and Wushu and more kung fu up until the show started. And that was great, you know, all that training was really cool. I just wish that that level of training could have continued while we started shooting. But once we started shooting my schedule was so jam packed. I was working 14 hours a day, every day and there was no room for anything other than shooting and resting and learning lines.\n\nAnd so when it came to stunt choreography and any kind of training, I was really doing that during off hours, and when your body has been put through a 14 hour grueling day Monday to Friday, and sometimes Saturday, and then working nights, your body is no real place to actually take on new information, especially learning a martial art. Like, people have spent years dedicating their lives to that, and in strict conditions. And yet here I am, trying to pop out a television show while also trying to become a master at martial arts. So everything was just very tightly squeezed.\n\nBut, saying that, we just got in to choreography whenever we could. That was in between filming takes, or my lunch breaks, or the weekends. I'd be in the gym, I'd be in the dojo, trying to pick up this stunt choreography. That was a bit more forgiving. We were kind of making it work up until like episode four. But from episode seven onwards, it was just, because the time was so, so crunched, I was learning on the day of shooting. I was kind of rolled out of bed in the morning. I'd have maybe fifteen minutes with the entire crew. The stunt crew's already choreographed. They've choreographed with all the stunt doubles and all the extras and everyone else. And they'd come on set, and just kind of plunk me in and tell me what I needed to do, and then I'd just get on set and do it. That was the kind of reality of the Iron Fist situation because, you know, it's just the nature of the beast.\n\nBut with Defenders, in terms of choreography, I had more time because I had those days off, and I had room on my schedule to actually go into the dojo for a good day or half a day, and actually really take my time learning the choreography. The great thing is now that I've got some time -- I've got maybe six months before we start shooting again -- is now I have time to really go and put myself into a proper program, something I didn't have the fortune of doing before. So I just feel moving forward to Iron Fist season 2, I'm going to feel a lot more better about the martial arts. I'll be a lot more trained and practiced. I've just got time on my side just to kind of jump into it.\n\nWhat was your most challenging moment shooting Defenders compared to the early challenges of Iron Fist?\n\nWell, for one, it's always difficult doing night shoots and having to do these huge fight scenes at like 4 in the morning after working at it all week. That's always a challenge. But actually, I kind of think the biggest challenge for all four of us is just staying focused. We had such a great time on set, and we were always joking around and having great fun when we were together 'cause we got on so well. It was actually a really enjoyable shoot.\n\nI suffered from a leg injury early in Defenders. I'm still trying to work out what it is. I've kind of done something to my thigh or groin ,which really hurts. And kind of working on that and trying to work through that is a bit of a challenge, especially when you don't know what the diagnosis is when you do something to yourself. I've had physios, I went to an MRI scan, and done all this stuff. So trying to do the choreography with an ongoing injury when you don't know what it is, that's always different and challenge, but, you know, you get through it. It's part of the job. You've got to look after your body, 'cause otherwise, it's going to fall apart on you.\n\nDanny is kind of is the central figure of The Defenders, in a way, because it's kind of his quest to take down the Hand now that is going to bring everybody getting together. Were you aware that that was the way this was going when you first took the role? When you were first cast as Iron Fist, did they also say, \"And these are the stories elements of The Defenders?\"\n\nThey didn't tell me anything past the first two episodes of Iron Fist, and that's what Marvel is like! They're very secretive, so I just took it on good faith that the showrunners and Marvel were going to do me right. Reading through The Defenders, Danny's journey is awesome. From the beginning, where we see Danny in Iron Fist to where he ends up in Defenders, he has made that complete origin arc. He has shed his immature self, and so the idea is in The Defenders, he has become the Iron Fist.\n\nThere's a quote in Iron Fist 1. I think it was like, \"Cast off the childish needs\" or something like that. I mean, Lei-Kung said that to him, and he really has done that by the end of Defenders. He's got his shit together. He's grown up, and he now understands the responsibility of the Iron Fist. Like, before, he didn't know what to do with it. He didn't really respect it because he has his own issues that he had to deal with. He had to deal with losing his parents, coming back into society after a fifteen years, dealing with owning a corporation, dealing with getting his identity back, like all these issues that he had to deal with before he could actually understand what the responsibility of the Iron Fist meant. And, you know, that allowed him to make very bad decisions over the time because he wasn't thinking clearly. He wasn't being responsible.\n\nBut now, at the end of Defenders, with the help of the other Defenders because I think they teach him a lot. Luke is like the coach figure to Danny. Daredevil is like the older brother. And Jessica Jones is like that real street smart sister that always kind of like... You know when you're being too up your own ass, Jessica Jones would bring you down to earth and ground you a little bit. And throughout all of these three different perspectives coming into his life is also the fact that they're superheroes. At the end of Iron Fist, Danny doesn't even know what a superhero is. So then to suddenly be interacting with these three superheroes, it gives him a deeper sense of what he can do with this power that he has, so really just make him kind of wise up and come to term with responsibilities a lot more.\n\nBy the end of The Defenders we really see the full formation of Danny into the Iron Fist as a superhero and not just a kid running around with his awesome power and responsibilities because he doesn't know what to do.\n\nFans are definitely eager to see how he relates to Luke Cage in particular because there's this comic book history between them. Is there anything you can say about that?\n\nWell, for one, I love Mike [Colter]. He's a great guy. We get on really well together as actors, but also as the characters, there's some really good chemistry there. I think we're kind of blessed that we get on with each other so well.\n\nBut it's not like they meet each other and from the first moment they're best friends, you know? There's friction there at the beginning, and it's pretty obvious because we come from two different worlds. Luke Cage is from the streets. He's from Harlem, he's from a rough area, and he's trying to do good. He cares about community, he cares about lifting the bottom up, whereas Danny comes from a world of privilege, and he comes from a completely different side of New York, one of privilege, one of power, one of money. And so when they come together, they definitely have a clash of ideals which throughout The Defenders, they are coming to grips with.\n\nI think what holds them together, despite their huge differences, is that on a base level, they are just two men who are outsiders. They have kind of got these powers and these responsibilities but they are lost. And through that lost-ness, and that vulnerability, I think they see a real kindred friendship within one another. I think the way that Marvel has written the beginning of this friendship, it feels very real. It feels like it comes from a very genuine place. I'm really excited to see where that friendship develops after Defenders because I think it lays the groundwork for some really interesting story developments over time.\n\nIs there any talk yet of giving you a mask?\n\nI'm sorry. [Laughs] I'm just an actor. All these costumes are kind of up to the Marvel execs cause they run the comic book side of things. They're the ones with the designs or the costumes. I don't really get involved in those conversation. But, I would love a mask. You know that yellow plastic mask with the two ribbons blowing in the wind? Sure, I'd love to see that on Danny in that in season 2. He'd have to have it.\n\nThat's cool because a lot of actors are kind of shy about that. And it's cool that Defenders keeps things street level this way, but...\n\nThe thing with all of these shows is not that we're shy to bring the costumes. It's not that we're afraid of them, it's more that we want them to feel authentic when it does happen. Like for Danny's character, I know there's a lot of conversations like, \"Oh, why isn't Danny in a costume yet?\" Well, it's because Danny's on this journey to becoming, understanding what this responsibility is. Throughout all of season one, he was in no state of mind to put a suit on. That would've been ridiculous because number one, he was not fully accomplished as the Iron Fist yet. Number two, he certainly doesn't have the right or the responsibility to be putting on a superhero costume. He needs to work his shit out.\n\nSo it's not so much that we're scared to put on a costume, it's just that we want it to feel right. And certainly by the end of Defenders, it will feel right. And moving into Iron Fist Season 2, I would love to see Danny certainly get a mask. Especially the classic yellow mask with the ribbons in the back. In terms of costume, it will have to be practical as well as looking pretty badass. I guess that will be up to the costume designers to work out what the costume would look like, but I think it will have to be practical. I would have to be able to move in it, but also look incredibly badass and modern, you know. I'm excited. I think they'll do a good job, whatever it is.\n\nYou have any funny stuff that's happened to you since you're shooting in the streets of New York at odd hours? You're bound to see some stuff.\n\nOh yeah. Totally. We were filming in Times Square, and we were doing like a walk and talk, so we were just walking down the street. It was me and Jessica Stroup, who plays Joy Meachum. And I think it was like a Friday night, Times Square, and it was about 3 AM, and so we were just walking down, doing the scene, and then suddenly we just hear this, \"Cut! Cut!\" And we stopped, and we're like... \"What do we do? What's going on?\" And the crew's like, \"Don't worry about it. Keep it going. There was a mistake.\" And we were like, \"Oh okay, all right.\" We reset ourselves, we did it again. Doing the scene again, and then we heard, \"Cut, cut, cut!\" And we were like...\" What the fuck is going on?\" And then we looked over the road, and there was a bunch of drunk guys having a night out, and they saw us filming decided to play director. It was pretty funny.\n\nBut New York is a great city to work in. There's always all sorts of interesting quirks. It's totally iconic. Like, for instance, the other day, Jessica Jones was shooting on my doorstep. Literally on my doorstep. On the crossroads of my street. And I went out -- it was probably about 7 PM -- and I went out to get some dinner. And as I was walking down the street, I suddenly just walked into a Jessica Jones scene. And everyone -- and it was all the same crew from Iron Fist and The Defenders -- and everyone was just like... \"Finn? What the fuck are you doing here?\" And I was like, \"What the hell are you doing here? This is my neighborhood. Why are you shooting on my street?\" And they stopped the whole production, and I said hello to everyone. It was really nice.\n\nSo I take it there's no chance that you have a cameo in Jessica Jones, is there?\n\nWell, you never know. It's possible. Now that all the Defenders are together, now that we've aligned, it's a lot more freeform for the characters, I think, to visit other people's individual series, because we've made that connection now. It would just be more epic.\n\nYeah, it would make a lot of sense for you to show up on Luke Cage Season 2 as well.\n\nYeah, I'd love that. I'm fully down for a Heroes-For-Hire series.

But now Finn Jones and Charlie Cox, who star as these Marvel superheroes on the Netflix series \"Iron Fist\" and \"Daredevil,\" have joined forces with Mike Colter (\"Luke Cage\") and Krysten Ritter (\"Jessica Jones\") for a much-awaited miniseries hybrid.\n\n\"The Defenders,\" which finds this Fab Four banding together to fight a fearsome conspiracy mounted against New York City, hits Netflix on Friday, Aug. 18.\n\nJones continues as Danny Rand, co-CEO of Rand Enterprises who, now a Buddhist monk and martial arts expert, has the ability to call upon the mystical power of the Iron Fist as his alter ego. The first season of \"Iron First\" was released earlier this year on Netflix. Cox is Matt Murdock, a blind lawyer whose remaining senses are dramatically enhanced and who, for two seasons of his Netflix series, wrestles with his lawless dark side, the vigilante Daredevil. Both series will be back for new seasons.\n\n\"I'm not sure this has been done before, where you've got four individual series, four characters who have their own shows, teaming up for a miniseries. It's a process we had known about for a long time, so it felt like a celebration. We were ready for it and excited to see how it would turn out,\" said Cox.\n\n\"When all of these actors came together they really understood who their characters were so then when we actually started to play off each other it felt very natural because of the prep work had been in place for a number of years,\" added Jones.\n\nAs for newcomers who want to sample the \"Defenders\" source material, be advised: each Marvel series has its own distinct personality.\n\n\"I think the common misconception is all the superhero shows or films are all the same,\" said Cox. \"The superhero element makes it a genre of its own. And I have not found that not to be the case at all. If you look at what Marvel have done both in Netflix and the network's channels, and also of course in the cinematic universe, they have a variety of shows which all have the superhero element as part of it, but they are all completely different genres. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and 'Captain America: Winter Solider' couldn't be more different if you ask me. And I think that is very similar of our show as well. I mean, 'Jessica Jones' is a kind of a physiological thriller and 'Daredevil' season one is a crime drama. The superhero element is something that is just kind of sprinkled on top as like a garnish. You just have to find your show that has a tone or a feel that appeals to you.\"\n\nWATCH: 'The Defenders' Trailer (Source: YouTube)", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 1010, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304277", "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "307590", "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilante", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308262", "label": {"eng": "Vigilante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311156", "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "333570", "label": {"eng": "Captain America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349310", "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "386870", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}]}

Endowed with the power of the Iron Fist - allowing Danny to channel his chi into a powerful, glowing fist - Danny is tasked with defending the mystical city K'un-L'un from the Hand, the shadowy group of (sometimes undead) ninjas that have been giving Matt Murdock hell in two seasons of Daredevil. He is also seen performing some combos with the indestructible Luke Cage.\n\nAll the episodes of Marvel's The Defenders will premiere globally on Netflix on August 18, 2017.

Why is she going to be on stage with us? Is she moderating?'\n\n\"He was like 'No, she's going to be in the show' so the first time I met her we were already on stage and she was called out and so I was like 'Hi' in front of 5,000 people.\n\n\"For an actor to meet someone like Sigourney Weaver is a big deal so I had an impulse and luckily nobody handed me the mic and I didn't get to do this but i had the impulse to say 'in Hell's Kitchen no-one hears you scream' which i thought would have been fun and cool.\n\n\"But it could have been offensive, I don't know.\"\n\nThe Defenders will continue the narrative timeline of all the Marvel shows on Netflix and showrunner Marco Ramirez said keeping the stories straight was a huge task.\n\nHe said: \"We had charts like mad people.

That was the beginning.\"\n\nHe continued: \"When we started Defenders, the Iron Fist writers' room had just started so when we asked what happens in episode 13 they didn't know.\n\n\"We all had to play ball at the same time and figure out that is where it ends so this is what we can do.\"\n\nThe merging of storylines also presented challenges for Cox, who said: \"It is linear but the nature of the final episode of any TV series is there is some kind of climactic ending or something has happened or changed.\n\n\"With the end of season 2 of Daredevil I had my feelings and my ideas about what that had led him to do so there were important questions about how much time has passed? What has happened in that time? What had this character been up to?

See, the Defenders of TV and the Defenders of the comics may call themselves the same thing, but otherwise they're almost nothing alike.\n\nImages: Marvel Comics\n\nMeet the Real Defenders\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe has already featured the two of the three original Defenders -- but not on Netflix. Doctor Strange, the Incredible Hulk and Namor the Sub-Mariner (one of Marvel's oldest comic characters, and delightfully arseholish King of Atlantis) first came together in the pages of each of their respective comics in 1969 and 1970. The Doctor Strange series had been cancelled mid-arc, so writer Roy Thomas simply carried on Strange's last story in Hulk and Sub-Mariner, turning it into a team-up special that saw the heroes unite to fight off an invasion of Lovecraftian horrors. A year later Thomas would create another trio, this time featuring Namor, Hulk and the Silver Surfer, but the original three reunited and were officially designated as \"The Defenders\" in the first issue of Marvel Feature in December 1971.\n\nThe Silver Surfer remained absent from the story thanks to an edict by Stan Lee asking that he write all of the cosmic surfboarder's stories -- but when the team's debut proved to be overwhelmingly popular, the Defenders were given their own series, and Lee quickly approved of new writer Steve Engleheart's pitch to bring the Surfer into the Defenders fold by the second issue. Four issues into the run Asgardian warrior Valkyrie -- the spirit of an Asgardian named Brunnhilde living in the host body of a human woman named Barbara Denton-Norriss -- officially joined the line-up, and the classic Defenders were born.\n\nGiven the complex range of heroes on the team, the sort of missions that came under the Defenders' purview was much vaster in scope than that of Netflix's heroes. They fought everything from alien wizards (such as Yandroth, a \"technomancer\" from an alternate dimension whose giant robot body became one of the first villains the Defenders fought together), to actual eldritch horrors such as Null the Lifeless, a many-eyed, many-tentacled physical embodiment of the vengeful souls of a race of winged aliens from the Moon.\n\nThe weirdness wasn't just consigned to cosmic foes, either: The Defenders' bread and butter was in dealing with the depths of the supernatural. From iconic Marvel demons such as the scheming Mephisto -- who's probably best known for infamously annulling Spider-Man's marriage to Mary Jane Watson -- to long-time Doctor Strange foe Dormammu, the Defenders went to hell and back, sometimes literally, to take the fight to the paranormal. That even includes a time they actually fought Satan himself, thanks to the team's longtime alliance with Satan's son, Damian Hellstrom. They even occasionally had the time to fight \"normal\" supervillains, too!\n\nRise of the New Defenders\n\nIn the early years of Defenders comics, the group was a much less formal team than the Avengers -- they were more like a group of friends and acquaintances who happened to go out and save the world every once in a while. That also meant that the Defenders' membership was a revolving door that spun faster than any of the ones at Avengers tower.\n\nA few staple characters would emerge in the '70s alongside the primary five Defenders: Hellcat, AKA Patsy Walker, the Marvel romance-star-turned-supernatural-superheroine who would go on to be a major supporting character in the Jessica Jones Netflix series; Gargoyle, a human whose spirit was put inside the body of a gargoyle after a demonic deal gone wrong, and who was originally tasked with fighting the team; and Nighthawk, Marvel's infamous Batman knockoff, and former leader of the supervillain team Squadron Sinister. But the team's laissez-faire approach to membership lead to heroes from all walks of life in Marvel's comics, famous and obscure, joining and departing the group. Heroes such as Luke Cage, Hawkeye and even Hank Pym (in his Yellowjacket persona rather than as Ant- or Giant-Man) stopped by in the mid-'70s for loose alliances with the team. But the team still operated mostly in secret, until the story \"Defenders for a Day\".\n\nAfter a Defenders documentary about the team -- and their lax approach to hiring new recruits -- was aired to the public, interest in joining the team spiked, and dozens of heroes showed up at the Defender's no-longer-secret headquarters hoping to join (and promptly quit a few issues later once the mania died down). Among those temporary Defenders was the Iron Fist, joining Luke as the only two members of the Netflix show's lineup to have formally been a member of the Defenders in the comics. (That's right: Daredevil, Netflix's \"First Defender\", has never actually been a Defender.)\n\nBy the early '80s, however, big changes were coming to the Defenders. In a bid to shake-up the series the title was re-branded as The New Defenders from issue 125, and Doctor Strange, Namor, Hulk and Silver Surfer were removed from the series -- due to a newly-revealed prophecy that claimed should the four unite again, they'd be responsible for the end of the world. Although key players from the '70s such as Gargoyle, Valkyrie and Hellcat remained, the departure of the original team lead to the rebirth of the Defenders as a much more formal organisation, led by X-Men's Beast (who had joined the team 10 issues earlier) and now featuring other familiar mutant heroes such as original X-Men Angel and Iceman, alongside new members such as future Guardians of the Galaxy member and telepathic martial artist Moondragon, as regular characters.\n\nThis more structured superhero team take on the Defenders wasn't to last. Although the changeover to the new team had drawn increased interest and The New Defenders performed well saleswise, Marvel decided to cancel the series 27 issues later in 1986 to help establish a new roster of series. The final issue saw Moondragon, possessed by a psychic demon conveniently named the Dragon of the Moon, betray (after seeing visions of her teammates talking behind her back, of all things!) and slaughter several of her fellow Defenders, freeing up the remaining mutants on the team to join the newly-created X-Men spinoff team X-Factor as per an editorial request. To make the end of the Defenders series seem even more pointlessly publisher-mandated, several of the killed heroes, including Valkyrie and Gargoyle, were resurrected almost immediately in other series to ensure that at least some of the original team lived on elsewhere.\n\nSecrets and Orders\n\nOver the next two decades, the Defenders concept would attempt several reboots and returns. The original Defenders reunited for two storylines in 1990 -- in which they discovered that the prophecy that drove them apart was an elaborate hoax designed to, well, drive them apart -- but the team would not get its own comic again until 1993's Secret Defenders, and even then it was radically unlike what came before. Even though the original team had discovered they could work together again without dooming the world, only Doctor Strange returned, and in an homage to the original series' rotating cast, each issue saw Strange recruit a new team of Defenders for a one-off mission, disbanding them upon completion to keep the Defenders' return a secret.\n\nThis meant the series could feature big-name Marvel heroes who otherwise couldn't commit to a formal team -- Wolverine, Spider-Man, Captain America, Scarlet Witch and more made appearances -- but the series quickly hit troubled waters when Marvel removed Doctor Strange himself from the series to join the supernatural team Midnight Sons. Although leadership of the Secret Defenders would continue under the guidance of a far less popular character -- Strange's fellow mystic Doctor Druid -- without Strange Secret Defenders itself would last just 25 issues in total, ending in 1995.\n\nIt would take Marvel another six years to attempt a Defenders relaunch -- this time with a curse bringing the team together again rather than forcing them apart. Hexed to always unite and respond to grave threats to Earth, the original four Defenders were once again reborn a superhero team... for just 12 issues, when it was revealed that the aforementioned techno-wizard Yandroth, one of the team's earliest foes, was actually behind the curse that reunited them. Yandroth dominated the minds of the four Defenders, reforging them as \"The Order\" for a six-part follow-up miniseries that saw the return of Hellcat, Valkyrie and Gargoyle to save their friends from being turned into world-controlling madmen. At the end of the series, the Defenders were disbanded once again -- this time seemingly for good.\n\nThe Modern Defenders\n\nSo what's up with the Defenders now? Several attempts have been made to bring the team back since The Defenders and The Order at the turn of the 21st century. A 2005 comedic miniseries re-imagined the team as a dysfunctional group sick of trying to reform after several attempts, while The Last Defenders saw Tony Stark help form a post-Civil War team -- lead by Nighthawk, and featuring She-Hulk, Colossus, and the incredibly obscure Marvel hero Blazing Skull, who has a flaming skull for a head but is not related to fellow flaming-skull-owner Ghost Rider -- as part of his \"50 State Initiative\". He assigning the new Defenders to New Jersey, but the team was quickly disbanded due to gross incompetence by Tony; Nighthawk later reformed the team (adding back Damian Hellstrom as a team member to replace Colossus) as a secret superhero squad acting outside of government influence, but they were sadly never seen again.\n\nThe 2011 event series Fear Itself ultimately lead to two more attempts to get a Defenders book up and running. The first, launching in 2011, brought together the original team of Doctor Strange, Namor and Silver Surfer, alongside the Red She-Hulk and Iron Fist for a kooky, irreverent series, but it was sadly cancelled after 12 issues. A quasi-follow up in 2013 called Fearless Defenders imagined an all-female group of heroes, led by Misty Knight and Valkyrie, that followed a similar style. Sadly, however, it ultimately met a similar fate and was cancelled just a month after Netflix and Marvel announced a deal to bring a new team of Defenders to the streaming service.\n\nThat ultimately brings us to 2017, and the arrival of a new ongoing Defenders comic -- this time much smaller and much less weird than the series that started it all nearly five decades ago. Written by Jessica Jones co-creator Brian Michael Bendis, the new Defenders series pulls inspiration directly from the Netflix shows rather than the teams that came before, with Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Danny Rand and Matt Murdock coming together to tackle crime on the streets of New York.\n\nSure, it looks a lot more like the TV show you're going to start binge-watching this weekend, but unless Yandroth comes back for anther rematch, it looks like it will barely scratch the surface of the Defenders' long, bizarre comics history.\n\nWATCH MORE: Entertainment News", "date":

To some degree it's effective when you deal with people that have never been to New York,\" said Colter, 40.\n\n\"But if you've been to New York, you immediately can tell. New York is very important because I think it symbolises a sort of freedom to the world.\"\n\nThe Defenders is distinguished from many superhero series and movies in the time it takes to explore the internal conflicts that haunt each of its heroes.\n\nJessica Jones, in particular, is struggling to find her place in the world, scarred by \"traumas and injustices\" after losing her parents in a car accident, says Ritter, 35.\n\nWhen they are brought together, each of the four Defenders is in transition, without a superhero costume, in search of an identity.\n\n\"I built (Jones) from the ground up, based on her back story, on what she's been through in her life and how she views the world -- with a little sense of humour on top of it to lighten things up,\" said Ritter.\n\nShe added that she sees Jones as \"a character who has super powers\" rather than as a superhero.\n\n\"For me, it's character first, drama first. I just approach it like I would any other acting part.\" -- AFP", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217579"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302866", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303413", "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303672", "label": {"eng": "Multinational corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308155", "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "317651", "label": {"eng": "X-Men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "318868", "label": {"eng": "Augury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "331759", "label": {"eng": "Fantastic Four"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}]}

For a moment I almost forgot I was standing on a soundstage in the middle of a warehouse in Brooklyn.\n\nIt was about four degrees outside and threatening rain, but when I looked out the \"windows\" of Colleen Wing's dojo, as long as I didn't go right up to it, it could have been spring, foliage in bloom.\n\nIf I said I wasn't excited about being on the set of The Defenders, I would be lying.\n\nThe Marvel and Netflix superhero mash-up of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist was still six months away at that point (this set visit was in February) and we hadn't seen anything of it yet -- no production stills, no trailers. The Defenders was announced in late 2013 so this was more than three years in the making.\n\nBack then, the Iron Fist release was still a month away but having seen screeners of the early episodes, I recognised Colleen's dojo instantly. It wasn't being used today so it was our home for the day -- myself and a pack of reporters from countries including Singapore, Philippines, Mexico and Brazil.\n\nA semicircle of folding chairs had been arranged for us on the foam jigsaw mats that lined the floors, in between the surprisingly solid wooden posts that seemed to hold the ceiling up, at least on camera.\n\nThe dojo, a sparse set, was dressed with thoughtful details even though much of it wouldn't be discernible on screen. There were odes to Colleen's Japanese heritage including a small shrine, Haruki Murakami books and, of course, weapons.\n\nA class schedule was printed on a prop calendar in the hallway outside the dojo's door -- the holiday party was pencilled in for December 13 though, one suspected, given how the story of Iron Fist unfolded, it probably didn't go ahead.\n\nThere was a deliberately worn-down character to the set -- the paint chipped away in places, the kitchen cabinets were mismatched shades of caramel and an old Whirlpool fridge sat in the corner. The level of detail is mind-blowing.\n\nA publicist announced the first of our interviewees is a few minutes away and we all take a seat. One after another, stars from The Defenders and The Punisher, which was being shot simultaneously, rolled through the room, all facing us for their 30-minute grilling.\n\nWe met three out of the four Defenders superheroes -- Charlie Cox (Daredevil), Mike Colter (Luke Cage) and Finn Jones (Iron Fist).\n\nCox had the air of a seasoned professional who spoke eloquently about the acting process, and made sure everyone got to ask their question. Jones, the only one still in his twenties, had a youthful energy that hadn't yet been blunted by the storm of negative critique that was about to hit Iron Fist. Colter talked really fast.\n\nKrysten Ritter was the only Defender that remained elusive -- she was busy launching a knitting kit that day. Ritter's affinity for knitting is all over her Instagram -- how very un-Jessica Jones.\n\nDeborah Ann Woll, who plays Karen Page but is best known to audiences for her work on True Blood, was pulling double duty shooting both The Defenders and The Punisher.\n\nAt the end of Woll's interview, the publicists rolled in a cake, followed by her boyfriend and dog. It was her birthday. She had come in on her day off, on her birthday no less, to promote the show. What a trooper.\n\nIt must have been so awkward, to have a group of strangers sing you an off-key \"Happy birthday\" and then eat cake together. Woll had only met us 25 minutes earlier and was unlikely to ever see us again. But if she found it odd, she didn't let on -- she was sweet about it. The cake, though, was too sweet.\n\nLate in the afternoon, everyone was desperate to go see the filming a few stages over. Partly because we were told there was coffee there and jet lag was starting to catch up on half the room, the half from Asia with its 16-hour time difference. Of course, it's American coffee so I wasn't sure if there was anything to get excited about.\n\nWhen we arrived on the cavernous stage, there was a buzz of activity around two monitors displaying what was happening inside the wooden panels that made up the set where Colter and Scott Glenn (who plays Stick) were shooting a scene.\n\nWe were given headphones to listen in. Luke and Stick exchanged words before Luke collapsed on his side. The director was trying to get the perfect shot of Luke's head hitting the ground.\n\nEvery time they had to reset the scene, the panels were rolled back to clear the smoke. Colter milled around, joking with the crew. At 1.91cm, he towered over everyone, well, everyone except his stunt double.\n\nI didn't have any of the swill-looking coffee but I can vouch for the chocolate fudge cookies. Delicious.\n\nIn between takes, the unit publicist, an Aussie expat, took us through the adjacent set of Daredevil's apartment. The set wasn't lit so we quickly took in what we could -- the braille labels on the jars in the kitchen for the blind character and the gyprock \"stone\" walls.\n\nOn our way back out, the publicist pointed to an area of the warehouse that was Iron Fist's office.\n\nMarvel's street-level superhero shows are endlessly filming, one after another. Jessica Jones season two was to film directly after The Defenders and there is still the second season of Luke Cage and the third season of Daredevil to come. Iron Fist was recently renewed for a second season too.\n\nThe publicist tells us that the Netflix Marvel series have grown so much they've expanded to three sets in Brooklyn with more sets still in Long Island. Any sets not currently in use are packed away until they're needed.\n\nThe area of Brooklyn in which The Defenders was shot is a popular spot for film crews. The Good Fight, Blue Bloods and Master of None were just around the corner.\n\nI wondered about braving the blistering cold and taking a walk around the block. I really wanted to run into Aziz Ansari.\n\nThe Defenders premieres on Netflix this Friday, August 18 from 5pm AEST.\n\nCheck back on Thursday for what Charlie Cox, Mike Colter and Finn Jones have to say about Marvel's ambitious TV miniseries.\n\nContinue the conversation on Twitter with @wenleima.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 100, "id": 7, "label":

It just takes a couple of episodes, because these Defenders squabble among themselves at considerable length before they get around to saving millions of innocent lives.\n\nAll that bickering is not uninteresting, it should be added, and it provides valuable intel for viewers who aren't already committed Marvel addicts because it helps define who these characters are.\n\nWhatever the motive, co-developer and showrunner Marco Ramirez won't be rushed.\n\nWhat finally convinces these four stubborn and neurotic folks to form a grudging alliance is the looming menace of The Hand, one of those ancient secret organizations that has parlayed extra-sensory powers into centuries of lethal mayhem with no apparent consequences.\n\nDebating and dissecting the precise details of The Hand's origin, mission and operation will provide hours of enjoyment to hard-core fans.\n\nFor the civilians that Netflix and Marvel hope will also enjoy the show, the oversimplified explanation is that members of The Hand ensure their own immortality by terminating the mortality of others.\n\nNor is that a one-on-one process. In this case, The Hand is laying plans to wipe out New York City, the same way that in past centuries it wiped out, say, Pompeii.\n\nThe Hand's full lineup is shadowy, so for purposes of this show we focus on one main spokesperson: Alexandra, intriguingly played by Sigourney Weaver.\n\nAlexandra's demeanor will remind viewers less of a megalomaniac than a history museum docent. She speaks in calm, measured and very confident tones of what The Hand will be doing and why no one can stop it.\n\nEven the fact Alexandra has a distressing personal secret doesn't affect the systematic way she grooms Elektra (Elodie Yung) to become Black Sky, an unstoppable human weapon.\n\nMarvel fans, particularly those who have followed the Iron Fist, Daredevil, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones solo shows on Netflix, will recognize a number of characters, including Elektra, and will note how plotlines introduced in those earlier shows blossom into dangerous fruition here.\n\nThose who don't recognize the backstories won't get a lot of explanation. If you don't know that Luke and Jessica used to date, The Defenders isn't written to fill you in.\n\nThe clear hope is that The Defenders needs no exhaustive Marvel DNA to spin a compelling yarn about a small band of flawed good guys who start as serious underdogs in a battle to save The World's Greatest City.\n\nIn fact, The Defenders in this series aren't even the same characters who formed The Defenders in the group's original Marvel Comics incarnation.\n\nThe new group works just fine, however, from Ritter's sullen, wisecracking Jessica to Cox's intense Daredevil.\n\nThey also get some help from Punisher (Jon Bernthal), the last survivor from a small band of other good guys who have been trying to bring The Hand to justice for centuries.\n\nSome of the mystical stuff in The Defenders remains just that: mystical. But after a couple of episodes, and a couple of fights that resemble high-tech barroom brawls, viewers will get the rhythm of the story.\n\nIn a way, in fact, the slow burn helps, because all the byplay among the individual Defenders makes them quite engaging - and with an adversary as cool as Alexandra, they'll need heat that lasts.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303747", "label": {"eng": "History"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "342245", "label": {"eng": "Punisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_docent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "369689", "label": {"eng": "Museum docent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "386870", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bernthal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "468287", "label": {"eng": "Jon Bernthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "641252", "label": {"eng": "Elektra (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9lodie_Yung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "745907", "label": {"eng": "\u00c9lodie Yung"}}]}

The Marvel superheroes, each equipped with disparate powers and their own Netflix series, are thrown together for an eight-episode limited series that debuts Friday on the streaming service.\n\nIn it, Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) reluctantly join forces after they each encounter a nefarious network of ninja masters known as the Hand.\n\nThis dangerous cult will do anything to achieve immortality, a mission that includes, of course, wiping out considerable swaths of humanity. Members of the Hand hide in plain sight among the moneyed jerks of the New York 1%, sipping fine wine and listening to classical music while their minions exploit the other 99% to get what they want.\n\nImagine if such evil was real!\n\nLeading the charge is the ancient being Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver) and her sidekick, the recently resurrected Elektra (Elodie Yung). Alexandra has been around for centuries, but for some reason she's now taken ill and isn't expected to live much longer. So much destruction to wreak, so little time.\n\nShe needs to move fast, but there's a formidable opponent in her way: The series' pacing.\n\nThe first three episodes eat up precious time with superhero exposition: Here's what they've been doing since the last season of their series, their ongoing internal battles and how their paths cross, etc.\n\nThe bullet-proof Cage, for instance, has been released from prison; back in Harlem, he continues to fight crime while accompanied by a soundtrack of hip-hop, soul or funk (no other character gets such treatment).\n\nAfter being assumed dead for 15 years, trust-funder Danny Rand, a.k.a. Iron Fist, returns to civilization where he is still as annoyingly wussy as he was during his much-maligned series.\n\nMeanwhile, Daredevil's move away from crime fighting didn't last long. The attorney who's offered to represent Jones after one of her many run-ins with the law, Daredevil still can't resist jumping in when needed -- be it a mugging in progress or full-tilt battle with the ninja crime syndicate.\n\nThe cynical Jones is the only one in this gifted crew who remains stubbornly the same. The private detective would rather drink, curse and forgo showering than help anyone in need -- unless she absolutely has to, and of course, she does.\n\nAnd that window on the front door of her apartment? It's still busted and covered with plywood and screaming out to be fixed.\n\nExploring the origins of the Hand also takes up extensive amounts of time. Something about bad chi, the Himalayas and defecting from an ancient order of monks? Regardless, most viewers will still need a flow chart to figure out where and how the group came to be, and why they're in New York (other than its obvious status as a mecca for evildoers with expensive taste).\n\nOr just watch with this series with a Marvel aficionado -- they can explain in laborious detail while you admire Weaver's transformation from top-tier Hollywood film star into elegant, well-heeled TV super villain.\n\nThe show really begins after \"The Defenders\" decide to work as a team, which essentially comes in Episode 4.\n\nUntil that point the superhero's story lines are stylistically in the same vein as their individual series -- Jones is shot through a gritty, punk rock lens; Iron Fist's scenes are gauzy and emo. Cage's world is bathed in a cool, '70s vibe. Once they join forces, however, the tone becomes crisp, modern and fast moving -- a colorful yet neutral backdrop for all the butt-kicking to come. And there's a lot of action here; wall-smashing, bullet deflecting, car-throwing fight scenes that make up for the slow start.\n\nHumor and insider jokes, such as the crew's immediate exasperation with Iron Fist, also help move things along. When the team members first introduce themselves, and the hippy-like Rand says, \"I am the immortal Iron Fist,\" Cage rolls his eyes while Jones snarks \"Are you on lithium?\"\n\nJones' one-liners are the high point of dialogue that often gets bogged down under the weight of explaining just one more thing. \"Why don't any of these superheroes have normal names,\" she says when she meets Daredevil and Iron Fist. And after a fight with one of the Hand's agents, she quips: \"Am I the only one left who doesn't know karate?\"\n\n\"The Defenders\" isn't as sharp and powerful as \"Jessica Jones,\" as deep as Season 1 of \"Daredevil\" or as stylized as \"Luke Cage,\" but it does the job as a holdover until these flawed heroes return with follow-up seasons.\n\nUntil then, allow Cage to take a bullet for the Netflix franchise, or Jones to lift a car or even the underwhelming Iron Fist to shatter a ninja blade with his fist. They're keeping NYC safe. At least until the next superhero-supervillain show rolls into town five minutes from now.\n\n'The Defenders'\n\nWhere: Netflix\n\nWhen: Anytime, starting Friday\n\nRating: TV-MA (may be unsuitable

The pairing feels relevant, which I think is the most important thing.\"\n\nCharlie Cox, returning as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, added: \"They're some of my favourite scenes, actually. And it definitely feels like the start of something big.\"\n\n\u00a9 Sarah Shatz/Netflix\n\nThe Defenders is the culmination of Marvel's original deal with Netflix, with all four solo series and the final ensemble show all being announced back in late 2013.\n\nLooking back, Jones admits: \"I don't think we really understood what we'd got ourselves into.\"\n\n\"Yeah... that's just a lot to compute,\" agreed Cox. \"That's Phase One? How many f**king Phases are there?!\n\n\"I go into so many meetings, where they're like, 'We're making this show, but the end goal is that we're gonna rule the world' - and then you do a pilot and it doesn't get picked up to series.\n\n\"So I remember signing this contract and just thinking, 'Yeah, let's just deal with Daredevil, shall we? And see how it goes'.\"\n\nThe Defenders will launch all eight episodes exclusively on Netflix this Friday (August 18).\n\nGIF Related ArticleThe Defenders TV show - everything you need to know\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

I got a phone call from Jeph Loeb (exec VP and head of television at Marvel) before we showed up for the reveal at Comic Con in New York .\n\n\"That morning he called me and said 'Just so you know, there is going to be the four of you on stage and one other person and it will be Sigourney Weaver' and I was like 'Why? Why is she going to be on stage with us? Is she moderating?'\n\n\"He was like 'No, she's going to be in the show' so the first time I met her we were already on stage and she was called out and so I was like 'Hi' in front of 5,000 people.\n\n\"For an actor to meet someone like Sigourney Weaver is a big deal so I had an impulse and luckily nobody handed me the mic and I didn't get to do this but i had the impulse to say 'in Hell's Kitchen no-one hears you scream' which i thought would have been fun and cool.\n\n\"But it could have been offensive, I don't know.\"\n\nThe Defenders will continue the narrative timeline of all the Marvel shows on Netflix and showrunner Marco Ramirez said keeping the stories straight was a huge task.\n\nHe said: \"We had charts like mad people. We had charts of where JJ left off, charts of this is what is happened in Luke.\n\n\"When we started writing Iron First hadn't come out so it was just 'this is everything we think will happen on Iron Fist, this is what happened between seasons'.\n\n\"We even had a chart telling us what season it would be, whether it was winter or fall, every kind of grid, everything, we were like Claire Danes in Homeland, we were just sitting in front of these things popping pills looking at the walls, where is the show? That was the beginning.\"\n\nHe continued: \"When we started Defenders, the Iron Fist writers' room had just started so when we asked what happens in episode 13 they didn't know.\n\n\"We all had to play ball at the same time and figure out that is where it ends so this is what we can do.\"\n\nThe merging of storylines also presented challenges for Cox, who said: \"It is linear but the nature of the final episode of any TV series is there is some kind of climactic ending or something has happened or changed.\n\n\"With the end of season 2 of Daredevil I had my feelings and my ideas about what that had led him to do so there were important questions about how much time has passed?

Netflix subscribers have been waiting just as patiently for the service's Marvel shows to collide in the much-hyped crossover miniseries, which is finally hitting screens on Aug. 18. But something tells me that the eight action-packed episodes are going to leave fans wanting more. So how long will it be until Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Danny Rand all join forces again? Will The Defenders return for Season 2?\n\nNetflix audiences will actually be getting The Defenders much quicker than moviegoers got The Avengers; it's only been two-and-a-half years since the streaming service launched its mini-Marvel universe with Season 1 of Daredevil back in April of 2015. Since then, fans have been treated to three more standalone series as well as a second helping of Daredevil; Netflix has already announced that additional seasons of all four shows are on their way, as well as brand new spin-off series The Punisher. Surely those additional seasons have to be leading up to a second team-up, right?\n\nWell, not so fast. Netflix is likely thrilled to simply be getting one unprecedented superhero crossover event off the ground; it's probably a bit premature to be looking for news of another go-'round. Netflix has yet to officially renew The Defenders for Season 2 -- or even acknowledge that a second crossover is something they're planning on in the long term.\n\nAt the Defenders panel at San Diego Comic-Con in July, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb refused to confirm or deny any plans for a renewal. \"I don't know,\" he told Collider on the red carpet. \"We haven't really gotten to that place. I don't know that there will be a Defenders 2.\"\n\nThat being said, it's nearly inconceivable to imagine Netflix not green-lighting a second season of The Defenders, especially if the miniseries attracts viewership numbers to match its advance buzz. But even if it is renewed, fans shouldn't expect another installment of the crossover next year, like a typical television series. It took 28 months for Netflix to build up to the first Defenders; if it takes the same amount of time between the start of the franchise's next \"phase\" -- kicking off in November with The Punisher -- to the premiere of Defenders Season 2, then fans would be looking at a release date sometime around March of 2020.\n\nIf that seems impossibly far away, there is hope that Season 2 could arrive a bit sooner than that. Once the universe is established, things tend to move at a slightly faster pace; while fans had to wait four years for the first Avengers movie, it only took another three years for Age Of Ultron, and only three years will have elapsed between that film and next May's Infinity War. If Netflix can similarly shave a good chunk of time off of its next \"phase,\" then it's conceivable that Defenders Season 2 could end up with a 2019 release date. But I certainly wouldn't count on it anytime before then.\n\nIt's not like there's not a lot to look forward to in the meantime. After The Punisher spins off fan-favorite character Frank Castle from Daredevil Season 2 into his own standalone series, Netflix will also grace fans with the further adventures of Jessica Jones and Luke Cage in 2018, and Daredevil and Iron Fist sometime after that. It's also a safe bet that Netflix will continue adding to its roster of superheroes in much the same way that the M.C.U. adds to its stable between each Avengers film.\n\nThat being said, viewers should soak up the awesomeness that is The Defenders as much as possible when it debuts on Aug. 18, because it's going to be a long wait before New York's mightiest heroes band together to fight the forces of evil again.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 100, "id": 523, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100, "id": 728, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309419", "label": {"eng": "Iron Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311297", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314207", "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315324", "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "342245", "label": {"eng": "Punisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_crossover", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "343622", "label": {"eng": "Fictional crossover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349310", "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "368601", "label": {"eng": "Infinity War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Television", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "386876", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "389251", "label": {"eng": "Ultron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeph_Loeb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "408147", "label": {"eng": "Jeph Loeb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}]}

In the four years since the collaboration started, we've seen Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter), and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) get their own series.\n\nAnd while we've known that this moment was going to arrive, the evil force that will bring our heroes together still remains a mystery. But one new final trailer sheds some light on Alexandra's (Sigourney Weaver) goals and what the Defenders must do to help protect the city. Check out the full trailer below.\n\nIn terms of footage, it is pretty much more of the same: the hallway fight scene, our heroes confronting Alexandra in a conference room, heroes discussing their next plan at the Chinese restaurant, and a few confrontations within the team. But at the same time, we get some sort of idea of what Alexandra's plans are. Of course, they are given in vague and contrary details. She wants to bring light into the darkness and to bring life where there is death. To which Luke Cage counters with \"For all your talk of life, you sure bring a lot of death.\" It's the whole she may say she has good intentions but they are really evil. What is clear is that Alexandra will be using a resurrected Elektra (Elodie Yung) to achieve those nefarious goals.\n\nYeah, it may be a little bit cheesy, but since when was that a huge problem. Of course, Daredevil has lost his purpose since losing his friends and the love of his life. Jessica Jones isn't exactly what you would call a team player. Luke Cage is looking for some sense of redemption. And the Iron Fist is still searching for his identity. Then there is infighting within the group as egos clash.

Marvel and Netflix are bringing all of their characters to one 8-episode miniseries for the first time to hopefully foil the enigmatic Alexandra's (Sigourney Weaver) plans executed by the ancient group known as the Hand.\n\nIn the past two years, each and every character has operated on their own -- serving their individual purposes -- so it is no surprise that working as a single unit for the first time won't come easy to them. That said, Daredevil (Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter), and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) will have to learn how to operate as a team quickly, especially if they want to save New York from the looming threat that it is about to face.\n\nRelated: Defenders: 15 Times Iron Fist Actually Did Something Awesome\n\nSpeaking to Den of Geek!, Cox breaks down the foursome's approach on their upcoming mission upon learning more about the aforementioned danger brought by the Hand:\n\n\"Now Danny and Matt have seen it. They've experienced it, and as hard as it is to explain, we know it exists because we've been there. Jessica and Luke don't have that. Initially at least, the role for Matt and Danny is quite similar. They're the ones that have to bring the other two up-to-date and explain how serious this situation is and how you can't just walk away from it and how dangerous these people are and what they're capable of, blah blah blah. So that was kind of our role.\"\n\nThis leaves Luke and Jessica (who already have a pre-existing relationship as seen in the first season of Jessica Jones) dubious of the \"ancient evil organization who are capable of destroying an entire civilization. They're the ones that have to go on the journey of disbelief through to 'holy shit', and getting on board this,\" the actor adds.\n\nIt all adds an interesting layer to why Danny, Luke, Matt, Jessica partner up in the initial stages of the show. This way, each duo has personal knowledge of the Hand. That way, it will be much easier for Danny and Matt to eventually convince their teammates to work together, and to give them a better chance of defeating the Hand and ultimately, Alexandra.\n\nMarvel TV and Netflix are still keeping huge chunks of information regarding the narrative specifics of The Defenders tightly under wraps, but fans are assured that whatever the team goes through in the special ensemble show will help progress their individual journeys moving forward.\n\nNext: The Defenders Shapes Marvel/Netflix Phase 2\n\nThe Defenders premieres Friday, August 18 on Netflix.\n\nSource: Den of Geek!\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

Charlie Cox was the first future Defender to make his MCU debut in 2015 with Daredevil. As the blind lawyer by day/crime fighter at night, Cox was responsible for establishing the tone of the Netflix Marvel series and has been the face of this corner ever since. He's the only one who has two seasons of their solo series prior to the team-up, with the second season ending in a rough way for Matt Murdock.\n\nAfter fully embracing his crime fighting urges, Murdock came to lose much of what and who he loves by season's end. He found love again in the arms of Elektra (Elodie Yung) only for her to convert to The Hand and die saving him. Plus, Nelson and Murdock split up because Matt couldn't keep up with their workload.\n\nRelated: The Defenders Final Trailer\n\nThese events have left Murdock in a precarious situation where he can't be the lawyer he once was and no longer has the desire to be the hero the city needs. The Defenders will change that, but Cox still says his character is searching for answers. As detailed in part of a full featurette for the show released by Marvel (featured at the top of this post), Daredevil is a lost man searching for purpose when the show begins.\n\nPlaying off of his lost nature, the featurette shows Murdock telling Luke Cage (Mike Colter) that he can't be part of this superhero team. Unfortunately for Matt (but fortunately for fans), he is already involved whether he likes it or not. The reluctance to join the team may not last long given the circumstances at hand, but it is unclear how close he will come to being his true self over the course of the mini-series.\n\nThat said, Daredevil is only one-fourth of the equation in this featurette and it gives further insight into what fans can expect from the series later this week. They may not be a team or even meet by the end of the first episode, but setting the stage for their team up should be worth the wait. This featurette starts to do some of that leg work, recapping where the four Defenders are when the series begins and their mindsets heading in. Murdock may have some self-doubt and be retired, but Jessica doesn't want to be a hero to begin with, Luke is fresh out of prison, and Danny is just coming back from a trip to K'un-Lun.\n\nAt the end of the day, any resistance they may have will be gone once Sigourney Weaver's Alexandra officially comes into play. These four heroes will unite to take her down and solve the bigger problem at hand, rather than dealing with their own personal problems. It will certainly change each of them when everything is said and done, but seeing that journey will be part of the fun. For Daredevil's sake, he's sure to find his mojo by the end of Defenders as he heads towards Daredevil season 3.\n\nMore: Daughters of the Dragon Meet in New Defenders Clip\n\nThe Defenders premieres on August 18 on Netflix, with The Punisher premiering later in 2017. Additional seasons of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage are expected to air in 2018, with the new season of Iron Fist coming sometime in the future.\n\nSource: Marvel\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

Series star Finn Jones has promised IGN that the choreography in the team-up series Marvel's The Defenders will more than make up for the action in his previous series.\n\nJones had previously admitted that the production schedule of Marvel's Iron Fist caused him to learn choreography the day of shooting, which he promised wasn't the case this time around. \"By the time of Defenders, I had been working on the character and training for about seven months, on and off, so by Defenders, I was a lot more well-trained than at the beginning of Iron Fist because I had been doing it for so long,\" the actor confessed.\n\n\"The good thing about Defenders, because it was an ensemble piece I wasn't needed every single second of the day to shoot, which is often the case when you're leading your own individual show,\" Jones elaborated. \"At the beginning of [Defenders] when we're all separated, there were definitely days in the week where I didn't have to shoot.\"\n\nJones continued, \"Because of that, I went in and got a chance to rehearse, spend days on choreography before we actually shot. But then as we all came together and our schedules became a lot tighter because of the shooting demands, there were often times, especially towards the end of the show where we were picking up choreography on the day of shooting. That's kind of a regular thing, that's just television scheduling. Unfortunately, it's just something we have to get used to.\"\n\nThe actor seemed quite aware of his previous series' flaws and was optimistic that fans would enjoy what Danny Rand had to offer in the new series.\n\n\"I think the choreography is a lot slicker and I think the way it's been shot and edited is definitely a lot more cohesive [in Defenders],\" Jones added. \"It was a different choreography team and the way it was shot was a little bit different as well, and I think that definitely helped sell the fight scenes a lot better. And on top of that, I was more used to picking up choreography and the fluidity of the movements.\"\n\nMarvel's The Defenders follows Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones). A quartet of singular heroes with one common goal - to save New York City. This is the story of four solitary figures, burdened with their own personal challenges, who realize they just might be stronger when teamed together.\n\nMarvel's The Defenders premieres on Netflix on Aug. 18, 2017.\n\nThe DefendersSunday at on Netflix ComicBook Composite 90 NAAll-Time Comic TV Shows Average rating Star Star Star Star Star 4.5/5 from 20 usersNAAll-Time Rated Full Profile New Marvel's The Defenders Poster and Stills Gallery Start Gallery Back to Article\n\nNew Marvel's The Defenders Poster and Stills Gallery\n\nImage -\n\nby Patrick Cavanaugh | August 17, 2017", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television_and_Movies", "wgt": 100, "id": 350, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Television and Movies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 100, "id": 361, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "wgt": 100, "id": 362, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 1010, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 1058, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302943", "label": {"eng": "Actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315611", "label": {"eng": "Chinese martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choreography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "318465", "label": {"eng": "Choreography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "354850", "label": {"eng": "IGN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_combat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "378360", "label": {"eng": "Stage combat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1307089", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (TV series)"}}]}

If you've enjoyed Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist up to this point, then you are definitely going to love The Defenders when it punches its way to Netflix on August 18. Sure, it might not feel as groundbreaking or revelatory as some of those shows were when they first debuted, but that's a small price to pay for getting to play around in this street-level sandbox once again. And boy oh boy, do they play.\n\nFor this review, Netflix was generous enough to provide screeners of the first four episodes, which makes up half of the eight-hour season. That's already a refreshing change from previous Marvel/Netflix series, which often felt much longer than they needed to be at the expense of narrative pacing. Even still, the team-up we've all been dying to see between Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Danny Rand doesn't happen immediately; it takes a few episodes for all four of the show's protagonists to get settled back in their own status quo first, with each separate world delineated from one another via color grading so dramatic that it's occasionally almost distracting. (Honestly, you'd think Hell's Kitchen and Harlem are just constantly bathed in red and yellow light.)\n\nNot that this is necessarily a bad thing; it mostly just adds to the comic book feel of the show, which also manages to nail the tone of each previous installment in the Marvel TV world. All the characters feel just as real and compelling out as they do in their own series, and their disparate personalities bounce off one another exactly the way you'd want... with maybe one exception, depending on how much you enjoyed Iron Fist. Those who skipped it will be glad to know that you don't need to have watched his show in its entirety to follow along, so long as you saw both seasons of Daredevil and know the basics about Danny Rand as a character.\n\nUnfortunately Danny's still the weakest, poutiest link in the beginning, but once our heroes all get in a room together, his demeanor becomes completely different (you can feel how thankful poor Finn Jones is to finally be enjoying himself), and he fits right in as the privileged, over-eager upstart in a team full of world weary desperados. Until then, you'll probably have fun watching Luke Cage call him out. A lot of fun, in fact. He's very good at it.\n\nOf course, the titles of each of these shows might bear the names of their heroes, but they still tend to live or die by their central antagonist. Luckily The Defenders has Alexandra, a wealthy and mysterious philanthropist who works closely with the Hand and who might be older than she appears. I assumed she'd be incredible based solely on the fact that she's played by Sigourney Weaver, but actually watching her is really something else; everything she wears, every calm word and slight tilt of the head, is perfectly riveting.\n\nSo too is her relationship with the Elektra, who, predictably, has been retrieved and revived by the Hand after her death in Daredevil season two. You mark my words-there are some fans who are gonna ship their ominously tender mentor/mentee relationship like it's the second coming of The Devil Wears Prada, but with even more erotic subtext this time.\n\nIf there's one drawback to the series, is that so far it's been such a long time coming and is so hotly anticipated that sometimes the way it plays out feels a little bit hollow. When Matt Murdock walks into an interrogation room where Jessica Jones is being held, I'm obviously excited, but I've also been thinking about how this situation might play out for the past two years since both their shows premiered, so I'm already expecting the payoff before Matt's even opened his mouth. Thankfully The Defenders lives up to those expectations, but so far it hasn't yet exceeded them -- yet being the operative word, of course, because odds are that the second half of the series will probably pack some more surprises. At the very least, it will have more fights, more snarky quips, and even more Sigourney Weaver. In the end, that's what we're all here to see, isn't it?", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217579"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Kitchen,_Manhattan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217604"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_Wears_Prada_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "408524", "label": {"eng": "The Devil Wears Prada (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_grading", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "767417", "label": {"eng": "Color grading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1292540", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage (TV series)"}}]}

Unlike that blockbuster culmination however, The Defenders smartly approaches the superhero mash-up with reluctant side-eyes over bumping fists.\n\nTaking place a month after the first season of Iron Fist, the show continues to follow villainous network The Hand which is slowly permeating through New York. This time-around the beast's head is Sigourney Weaver's Alexandra, who takes dramatic steps into hatching their biggest plan yet which pulls together the four heroes largely against their will.\n\nDespite the shorter eight episode run indicating Netflix have been listening to drawn-out complaints, The Defenders still suffers from being frustratingly slow at the beginning. We're forced to wait until the third episode for the heroes to properly collide, with this early sag feeling very uneven due to the overwhelming number of characters (we still have Foggy) and the heroes themselves varying wildly in quality (Iron Fist is still a chore).\n\nPlaced side-by-side however, the standouts shine even brighter than before. Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones feels like an essential antidote to counteract the abundance of males whining over their causes. Her presence in any scene instantly punctures any pomposity, and you'll be craving her put-downs and blas\u00e9 attitude whenever the 'chi' gets a little too overbearing.\n\nIn fact, women in general rule the roost. Sigourney Weaver is, as expected, a calculating, piercing delight as Alexandra, while the occasional appearance from Misty Knight, Coleen Wing and connecting glue Rosario Dawson often outshine the main heroes - whose primary story arc tackling The Hand feels too stripped of any engaging human element.\n\nOf the boys, Charlie Cox's Daredevil is the standout because his backstory continues to be the most engaging and fully formed. His initial encounter with Jessica Jones especially is a great surprise - with the pair sharing a tight comic chemistry which is sorely missing from this mass of characters elsewhere.\n\nFrom the first four episodes, it also feels like we haven't seen a moment which capitalises on the heroes combined abilities. There's collaborative glowing fists and bullet blockades between Luke Cage and Iron Fist which tease a Heroes For Hire spin-off may be on the horizon, but there's yet to be an action set-piece which smartly unites beyond simple fist flailing.\n\nThe fourth episode cliffhanger may signpost better things to come, but there's a nagging stale familiarity hanging over The Defenders. We've seen the impressively choreographed fight sequences from Daredevil, we've seen everyone garble about the The Hand, and we've definitely seen Danny Rand meditating against a wooden beam - let's just hope there's a secret ace coming which will inject much-needed life into Marvel's TV team.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305271", "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_arc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305456", "label": {"eng": "Story arc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "313939", "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "409370", "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "547406", "label": {"eng": "Misty Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_for_Hire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "749744", "label": {"eng": "Heroes for Hire"}}]}

Paired with the other powerhouses from the previous series in the franchise, Weaver fits in very well.\n\nWhile the heroes team up eventually, it takes its sweet time for the four of them to even cross paths.\n\nFor those who have watched the other series in the franchise, they will probably think there is too much set-up getting the characters to the point of teaming up.\n\nThis has a negative effect on the pace, and the series struggles to stay interesting through all of the setup. There is just too much exposition, and the series would benefit from cutting to the chase quicker.\n\nDanny Rand's series, Iron Fist, struggled with the terrible pacing and downright dreadful writing. Unfortunately, this new series does little to make the character more likable.\n\nFinn Jones was a delight on Game of Thrones, but Danny's story is just not that exciting. He knows a lot about the villains as he has been doing some investigating of his own, so the hope is that he can surprise us in the back half of the season.\n\nJessica Jones continues to be a delight, and it's interesting that she is still trying to move on from everything that went down with Kilgrave.\n\nConsidering the emotional torment David Tennant's twisted character put her through, it would have been a little too easy if she managed to move on and continue her investigations straight away.\n\nWith that said, next door neighbor, Malcolm, is the polar opposite of Jessica. He's turned his life around and looks healthier than ever. While Jessica has struggled to move on, Malcolm has flourished.\n\nIt's an interesting juxtaposition seeing Malcolm look out for Jessica this time around. Like I said before, Jessica has been through a lot, so moving on from that is going to be tough.\n\nDespite her cold exterior, she took care of Malcolm throughout the bulk of Jessica Jones Season 1 and even played a part in getting him off drugs.\n\nWith the bad guys going after everyone the heroes love, it's clear they are going to need to work together to save New York City as well as their loved ones.\n\nIt's a tough task, but they manage to become a unit by the end of The Defenders Season 1 Episode 4, and that's essentially the big jumping off point for the story.\n\nIf you thought there would be a string of awkward scenes between Jessica and Luke Cage, there really isn't. The awkward scenes come from Jessica and Matt (Daredevil).\n\nThanks to some meddling from Jeri Hogarth, the pair cross paths and play off each other well. Matt wants to conceal his identity and even steals Jessica's scarf to cover his face.\n\nYes, the humor is very much present in this series, and that's a good thing when you consider how dire the subject matter is.\n\nThe one-liners that come off the back of the scarf scene are just gold, and it helps Jessica and Matt form a bond.\n\nLuke is just out of prison and done hiding his superhero status. He's the big celebrity of Harlem, but that's not to say he wants to be known.\n\nEveryone is scared of him now because, well, he could send them flying into oblivion. Most of Luke's scenes are with Danny, and despite Danny's storyline sucking, the pair has some great moments together.\n\nIt would have made much more sense to have the two characters meet up on Iron Fist for the first time. It would cut a lot of the fat and made the story on The Defenders leaner.\n\nSigourney Weaver turns in a solid performance as the villain, but not enough was given away in the episodes screened to come to a decent conclusion about her character.\n\nShe fits the bill of a Marvel villain, but it's difficult to assess whether she's really the villain the trailers portrayed her to be. Without spoiling too much, she is linked to another villain from the franchise. Fans of the comics are in for a real treat with her storyline.\n\nAs has been the case with the Netflix Marvel TV Universe, the fight scenes are a high point, and I found myself egging on Elektra a lot of the time. The characterization was excellent.\n\nShe is one super powered human against four, yet she always seems to have the upper hand. Tying her story to Daredevil was a great move because it threw in some much-needed conflict for the masked crusader as he struggled to come to terms with hanging up his costume and stepping away from his Daredevil persona.\n\nOf course, It is a tired old trope to use a loved one to create drama, but it's obviously integral to the larger arc of the series.\n\nDespite the flaws, the series is still to fun watch and improves with each episode, so there's no reason why the final four will not continue that trend.\n\nHowever, as enjoyable as it is to have these characters meet, four episodes is a bit long to affirm their status as a team.\n\nObviously, it will be easier bringing them together in the future now that they've all shared time together, but a feature length episode should suffice as opposed to a full-fledged series.\n\nGiven that we've waited so long for The Defenders, first impressions are that while it's solid, it takes too long to get to the good stuff.\n\nThe side stories were interesting, but they meant more time without the core four fighting the forces of evil.\n\nWith the exposition out of the way, the final episodes should find the series flourishing and be the true test of the power of The Defenders.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217579"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304816", "label": {"eng": "Character (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307060", "label": {"eng": "Game of Thrones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "379719", "label": {"eng": "David Tennant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Man", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "531012", "label": {"eng": "Purple Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeryn_Hogarth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1325418", "label": {"eng": "Jeryn Hogarth"}}]}

To some degree it's effective when you deal with people that have never been to New York,\" said Colter, 40.\n\n\"But if you've been to New York, you immediately can tell. New York is very important because I think it symbolizes a sort of freedom to the world.\"\n\n\"The Defenders\" is distinguished from many superhero series and movies in the time it takes to explore the internal conflicts that haunt each of its heroes.\n\nJessica Jones, in particular, is struggling to find her place in the world, scarred by \"traumas and injustices\" after losing her parents in a car accident, says Ritter, 35.\n\nWhen they are brought together, each of the four Defenders is in transition, without a superhero costume, in search of an identity.\n\n\"I built (Jones) from the ground up, based on her back story, on what she's been through in her life and how she views the world -- with a little sense of humor on top of it to lighten things up,\" said Ritter.\n\nShe added that she sees Jones as \"a character who has super powers\" rather than as a superhero.\n\n\"For me, it's character first, drama first.

The newest series will unite four heroes previously seen in their own shows on the streaming #Content Provider. The team will stand together to fight a common enemy in the hopes of saving the city of New York. Of course, it won't be easy as they'll need to all get on the same page, putting aside their individual differences to fight for the greater good. Here's the latest about the new \"Defenders\" miniseries and when it will be available to watch on Netflix.\n\nThe newest Marvel Universe installment, \"The Defenders\" is a team of four unique superheroes.\n\nIt will feature Matt Murdock aka Daredevil, a blind lawyer who is a vigilante that fights crime by night. Also featured will be detective Jessica Jones. She previously was a superhero and still uses her powers here or there, but mostly relies on her cunning wits while trying to avoid too much alcohol and other issues.\n\nThere's also Luke Cage, a brute force from the streets of New York. He was sent to prison years ago for a crime he didn't commit. While inside, a maniacal prison guard decided to use him for experimentation. It ended up creating a man full of super strength who has nearly impenetrable skin.\n\nFinally, there's Danny Rand, also known as the \"Iron Fist.\" He was the last of the four heroes to be featured in a Netflix standalone series. Rand is the son of a rich corporate father who sort of inherits the company.\n\nHe also becomes the \"Iron Fist\" and has expert Kung Fu skills along with a fist that glows gold and has an extremely energetic punch to go with it.\n\nThese four heroes will team up with a few common denominators between them. They include nurse Claire, who was featured in all four of the series and helped patch up the various heroes when they were seriously hurt. She also had a bit of a love connection with Luke Cage, as did Jessica Jones. In addition to that, there's lawyer Jeri Hogarth and mysterious Chaste leader Stick.\n\nOther characters who will pop up from the previous series will include Jessica's pal Trish Walker, Matt's buddy Foggy, police detective Misty Knight, and Frank Castle aka \"The Punisher.\"\n\nThe good news is that the wait is just about over for fans of the superhero shows. Marvel's \"The Defenders\" officially arrives on Netflix on Friday, August 18th, 2017.\n\nThe entire eight-episode mini-series will be immediately available for binge watching on Netflix.

It brings its New York-based main characters -- Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter), Daredevil, a.k.a. Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox), Iron Fist, a.k.a. Danny Rand (Finn Jones), and his partner Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) -- into a shared story line via separate subplots that give each hero an investigation or mission to pursue.\n\nThe missions eventually dovetail, as they must, near the end of episode three, setting up a series of meet-hostile/cute or patch-up-your-differences convos. Of course, these end with the good guys joining forces to smash a conspiracy headed by a terminally ill, chillingly confident industrialist named Alexandra Reid (Sigourney Weaver) -- a character who is apparently not a part of the print canon, though some Marvel fans have speculated that she's a gender-swapped version of a particular, semi-famous male villain. Of course, Alexandra would never be portrayed by a star of Weaver's caliber if we weren't eventually going to find out that she's at the center of all the mysterious goings-on, which include the disappearance of young street criminals offered lucrative employment by invisible bosses (a crime that's investigated by Cage); a missing-person case involving an absent father who turns out to be harboring explosives in his apartment (Jessica's story); and ninja assassins infiltrating the United States (Danny and Colleen's mission).\n\nI'd rather not say exactly what Matt's piece of the puzzle is, because its revelation constitutes one of the few genuinely delightful moments in the four episodes that were sent out for review. As overseen by co-showrunners Douglas Petrie and Marco Ramirez (Daredevil), The Defenders is a pretty grim slog for the most part, enlivened mainly by Jessica's hard-bitten one-liners, \"surprise\" appearances by major characters from Marvel's other Netflix shows, and a couple of lively fight scenes (though not the opening bout, which is so darkly lit and chaotically edited as to be barely comprehensible).\n\nUnfortunately, there are few vestiges of what made the Jessica Jones and Luke Cage solo outings mostly excellent, Daredevil's two seasons something more than merely competent (the Punisher ruled), and ... well, I wanted to say something nice here about Iron Fist, but I can't, because it was terrible. Most of the cringeworthy parts of The Defenders are drawn directly from Iron Fist's creative DNA, which was corroded by insufficiently examined Orientalist clich\u00e9s and a hopelessly white-bread central character, poorly cast and played by Jones. Creepy, often faceless Asian characters are all over the place here, and in a key section of the fourth episode, composer John Paesano's score merges three lazy musical-geographical stereotypes of Otherness into a single cue: Tuvan throat-singing, vaguely Arabic wailing, and mysterious Far East chimes and trills. The internet hot-take machine is going to roast this aspect of the series, which is too bad: It's sincere and inventive in other ways, and more connected to actual life than all but a handful of superhero stories produced at this budget level. There's frank talk of institutional racism, rapacious real-estate development, and gentrification, and when disaster strikes New York City, there's dialogue pointing out that poor people don't have insurance to cover repairs.\n\nOn a more immediate, nuts-and-bolts level, it's disheartening to see Netflix fall all over itself to create a small-screen answer to The Avengers. It does so at the expense of the character details and finely wrought, urban pulp atmosphere that made earlier entries in this franchise, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones most notably, feel special. Jessica battling a spectral rapist, Danny feeling guilt over leaving the mystical city of K'un-Lun unguarded, Matt giving up his Daredevil identity and trying to make sense of his love life and his faith, and Luke embracing his destiny as a neighborhood Samaritan and ending up in prison: These are all far more personal, serious, painful stories than we're used to seeing in big-budget punchfests. I resented how The Defenders rushed through these stories or pushed them into the background of a tale that's mainly interested in getting the gang together so that they can beat people up as a team.\n\nThere are pacing and structural problems, too, of a somewhat different kind than we've seen in Marvel-Netflix superhero shows. While every previous project suffered from what's been called \"Netflix bloat\" -- the tendency to reflexively order 13 episodes of a show when there might really only be enough plot to fill six or seven -- this comparatively truncated, eight-episode project doesn't overcome the problem; it just finds odd new ways to suffer from the same ones. When it's not sidelining character psychology to get to the next plot point, it's lingering on inside conversations that don't deserve lengthy consideration because the character development has been handled through spell-it-all-out groaners like \"Realize that you're only at mile one of a marathon\" and \"You know what your problem is? You're not comfortable with what you've become.\" And if the entire point was to thrill audiences by throwing these stars together in a single story, why not just jump right into it and bring us up to date on their individual stories when they're in the midst of action, as the better Marvel films have done? The approach here is not enough of one or the other, and when the team finally comes together in a big way in the fourth episode, you may rightly wonder if the buildup was worth it.\n\nTeam-ups are a time-honored centerpiece of superhero fiction, and there have been a couple better-than-average examples on the big screen in recent years (the original The Avengers, for sure). But it's worth pointing out that none of have been as satisfying dramatically as films and TV series that embrace geographical intimacy (the city or the neighborhood as opposed to the world or the galaxy) and focus on a handful of characters -- preferably one central hero, one central villain, and a suitable but not excessive number of allies and henchpersons. Admittedly, satisfying personal drama is rarely the goal in team-up projects. They're mainly about scratching that childhood rhetorical itch that wants to know whether Iron Man could beat up Captain America or if the Hulk could take Thor in a gladiator match -- a question that will be answered in the upcoming Thor: Ragnarok, unless they pull the usual lame \"it was a tie\" thing -- or, on a more mundane level, asking how exceptional but damaged people with radically different worldviews and life experiences find common ground and fight for the greater good (which is the story of democracy itself).\n\nThe Defenders has splashes of the latter fascinations -- the pairing of the orphaned blond millionaire-turned-mystic-warrior Danny Rand and the bulletproof Harlem fist-slinger Luke Cage, in particular, feels like a sociopolitical argument made flesh -- but the overall triviality of the project evaporates them. At least Ritter and Colter's performances continue to impress: Their melancholy realness rubs off on the most underwritten or under-imagined scenes, and whenever the story returns to their subplots, Cage's especially, The Defenders reminds you of what these Netflix series once seemed to want to be, and might someday become.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television",

You wouldn't confuse \"Jessica Jones\" with \"Iron Fist\" or \"Daredevil\" with \"Luke Cage.\"\n\nNow there's a fifth show, \"Marvel's The Defenders,\" available Friday on Netflix, that brings the four heroes together to form a superpowered crime-fighting team. Marvel has done this before, combining characters to assemble the blockbuster Avengers movies.\n\nBut the challenge for the showrunners Douglas Petrie and Marco Ramirez (who were in charge of Season 2 of \"Daredevil\") is a little different. Coming hot on the heels of the individual shows, each of which has already devoted 13 to 26 hours to its story, they're not just juggling personalities and plot points. They're also trying to mesh four different tones, styles, rhythms, color palettes, music philosophies and acting styles.\n\nThrough four of the eight episodes, they do an impressive job on that score. Without feeling like a paint-by-numbers kit, \"Defenders\" maintains the essence of the misanthropic private eye, Jones; the haunted blind vigilante, Daredevil; the bulletproof Harlem mensch, Cage; and the hippy-dippy martial artist, Iron Fist. It's even deftly faithful to the original shows' looks, going blue and steely when the action centers on Jones, white and misty for Iron Fist.\n\nBut the professionalism -- and have no doubt, \"Defenders\" is very well put together -- comes with some costs. One is the standard problem for this kind of assemblage: the need to give everyone equal screen time, and the exposition required to make sense of their getting together, means less of the things we come to comic-book stories for. There's a lot of getting-to-know-you and here's-what-we're-doing talk in the early episodes, and not a lot of action or emotion.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217579"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304576", "label": {"eng": "Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilante", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308262", "label": {"eng": "Vigilante"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311156", "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313909", "label": {"eng": "Hippie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315546", "label": {"eng": "Private investigator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "322393", "label": {"eng": "Misanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "324818", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Petrie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "657633", "label": {"eng": "Doug Petrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_philosophies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1008576", "label": {"eng": "List of philosophies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) have thus far existed alongside one another in the MCU's version of New York without crossing paths, but the growing threat of The Hand, along with a new enemy, will force them to come together as a team.\n\nAs exciting as the prospect is for fans, however, the culmination of so much pre-existing material can be daunting for those who have missed one of Marvel's Netflix shows. And while The Defenders will certainly be enjoyable for those with no prior knowledge of the characters or plots, a recap might be in order for those who haven't seen all of the shows or anyone just seeking a refresher.\n\nDaredevil\n\nSeason 1 of Daredevil mostly established the world of the Netflix corner of the MCU and set up the most traditionally super-heroic Defender. In it, we're introduced to a corner of New York City reeling from the alien invasion (a.k.a. \"The Incident) that took place in The Avengers. Along the way, we learn of attorney Matt Murdock's demons and the violent ways he exorcises them. Over the course of the season, he grows from the Devil of Hell's Kitchen to a fully suited-up Daredevil.\n\nWe also meet the villainous Kingpin, but he's unlikely to play a role in The Defenders. Still, he sets the template for the upcoming show's villain Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver). Both are criminals and entrepreneurs who see themselves as saviors -- albeit ones who use destructive means to assist the city. Kingpin's cabal also brings Madame Gao (Wai Ching Ho) into the world of the Defenders, a mysterious drug lord who will serve as a throughline for the series.\n\nFinally, Matt's best friend Foggy (Elden Henson) is introduced, alongside some other important supporting characters: small-time criminal Turk (Rob Morgan); Father Lantom (Peter McRobbie), a sounding board for Matt who connects him with his Irish Catholic faith; Stick (Scott Glenn), a blind warrior who trained Matt as a child; Claire (Rosario Dawson), a nurse who gets swept up in Matt's crusade and personal life; and Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll), a woman with a dark past who initially joins Matt and Foggy's law firm as a secretary, but eventually finds herself working for the New York Bulletin as a reporter.\n\nSeason 2 of Daredevil expands each of these relationships while introducing the Punisher, Elektra, and the Hand. The Punisher won't be along for the ride, but Elektra and the Hand will serve a major role in The Defenders. A former love of Matt's, Elektra helped shape the nascent vigilante inside the future superhero. She returns years later as the Hand, a mysterious group of ninjas, set their sights on Hell's Kitchen in a plot that began in season 1. Their leader Nobu is apparently able to resist death, which foreshadows Elektra's murder and resurrection at the end of the season.\n\nProphesied to be the Black Sky, the Hand see Elektra as the ultimate weapon. We also learn that Madame Gao has a connection to the ninjas - and some powers of her own - and find out that Stick is hunting all of them thanks to the group he represents, the Chaste. After killing a potential Black Sky candidate in season 1, season 2 reveals that Stick actually raised and trained Elektra, much like he did for Matt.\n\nThe season also continues to drive Matt and Foggy further apart, thanks to the duplicity and violent lifestyle of the former. Meanwhile, Karen and Matt grow closer, with the season ending as the latter reveals his identity to the former. We also see Claire stand up to the Hand, which costs the heroic nurse her job and sends her back home to Harlem.\n\nJessica Jones\n\nAiring between the two seasons of Daredevil, the story of Jessica Jones is much more straight-forward (well, as a straight-forward as a story about a super strong P.I. battling a mind-controlling sexual predator can be anyway). Focusing on the trauma of life after enslavement and sexual abuse, Jessica Jones is a dark character study lightened by the charismatic performances of Krysten Ritter and David Tennant as the hero and villain, respectively. Though Kilgrave will be back for season 2 of Jessica Jones, he won't play into The Defenders. Instead, the P.I.'s skills and mysterious past will likely factor into the plot.\n\nIn Jessica Jones we also met supporting characters like Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor), Jeri Hogarth (Carrie Ann Moss), and Malcolm (Eka Darville). Trish is Jessica's childhood best friend and has seen her at her best and worse. As the character closest to Jessica, she has ties to the hero's past both in terms of her gaining her powers and being controlled by Kilgrave. Trish is also training to be a vigilante herself, mirroring her character Hellcat in the comics.\n\nMalcolm, meanwhile, is a former junkie who lives in Jessica's building. Once controlled by Kilgrave in his plans against Jessica, we last saw him helping her reignite her investigation business. Hogarth is a powerful lawyer who has a contentious relationship with Jessica. Thanks to her position, she'll likely factor into the events that put Jessica and the Defenders on the trail of Alexandra.\n\nJessica Jones also introduced us to Luke Cage, a bartender with super-strength and unbreakable skin. Though Luke and Jessica have a brief relationship, it falls apart after Kilgrave forces the two to fight. Claire is able to show up and save Luke, before both characters head uptown on their own.\n\nPage 2: Luke Cage and Iron Fist\n\n\" 1 2\"\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

But how can a character like Murdock, who seemingly hung up his red costume at the conclusion of Daredevil Season 2, and who has his own issues to work through, handle operating with a team of similarly damaged heroes?\n\nAs part of our in-depth look behind the scenes of The Defenders, we were fortunate enough to speak to Charlie Cox by phone while he was filming an upcoming movie back in May. Here's what we learned.\n\nDen of Geek: What are you shooting right now?\n\nCharlie Cox: There was a very famous robbery in London in 2015. A bunch of guys who broke into a safe depository, and they stole millions of pounds worth of diamonds and jewelry from people who stored all their wealth in safes. Anyway, it became kind of a famous story because of the nature of the robbery itself. No one really knows how much they got away with. Some people say 25 million, other people say 200 million, 300 million.\n\nWhat was extraordinary about it is when they found the guys, they were all in their 70s. So it kind of became an amazing story, and everyone couldn't believe that these old geriatric had pulled off such an amazing robbery. And the robbery itself was amazing. It was extraordinary. The only reason they got caught was because they didn't understand technology, so afterwards, they just talked about it on their cellphones.\n\nBut that's something that you're kind of known for. I mean, you've done all these period dramas. People know you in America from things like Boardwalk Empire and Stardust. Does it ever strike you as funny that your best known role now is for something so different?\n\nYou know, it's odd. There's a period in my career where I wondered if I'll ever do anything that took place post 19th century. Post 1950s, even. Every line I ever said seemed to be preceded by \"Your Grace\" or \"My Liege\" or something like that, and I was desperate to have a cup of coffee in a scene. So it's quite nice now that the thing I'm most known for, probably, is something that takes place in the present. Yeah, man, it's kind of wild. I never thought I would have the opportunity to play a superhero. And I had friends, British actors, who have done that and had the experience, and... You know, I turned 30 in 2012? 2013? I thought that ship had sailed. So it's been great, it's been an amazing journey.\n\nWhy do you think that British actors keep getting all of these iconic American superhero roles?\n\nI genuinely have no idea. I don't know if it's a trend because Christian Bale did such a good job, or because Tom Hiddleston was so popular. I have no idea. But we're not going to fight it. We'll take them if they're there for the taking.\n\nIt's a really good question. I think it's surprising because there are some unbelievable American actors. Probably my favorite actors of my generation are almost all Americans, so it's nothing to do with that, I can assure you. Maybe it's just a fad, but I'm very grateful that it is a fad in this time because I'm getting benefits from it.\n\nYou're not just playing a superhero, you're playing a superhero a lot. Defenders is basically your third season as Daredevil, and Daredevil will have a season 3 as well. That kind of makes you the elder statesman of this group. How do you feel about that, and when they started casting the rest of the Defenders, did you reach out to any of them as this was going on?\n\nI did not. I mean, I reached out to -- by the time they casted Finn, we'd done two seasons of our show, and I'd met Mike and Krysten and I'd spent some time with them. And all three of us were aware that we're still waiting for the fourth member. So when they casted him, we all sent an email to him to say, \"Congratulations. Can't wait to meet you,\" blah, blah, blah. But when they were doing Jessica Jones, I knew we were going to do The Defenders at some point, but it felt like such a long way away, and it felt like -- you know, the Jessica Jones show -- it didn't feel like it had anything to do with my show at all, it was very different. I mean, I was excited to meet her, and we ended up getting along fantastically when we shot Defenders.\n\nBut, I don't know, it kind of felt like we all had our journeys privately, and then we came together for The Defenders. The \"elder statesman\" comment that you made, if that was ever true, that no longer feels true to me. By the time we got into The Defenders, it was very much an equal playing field. We were all given a similar amount of material, similar storylines. We all just kind of -- we got on fantastically well, the four of us. There was no feeling at any point that any of us are more or less important than the others. It never felt like I've been there the longest. At least, it didn't for me.\n\nI've watched the first two episodes, and I was impressed by how balanced it is between the four stories that are being told. I thought that was really something. Does that take some of the pressure off you?\n\nYeah, I think it probably does actually. I mean, look, I think it's going to be very, very different to the other shows. It certainly feels like it's very different to Daredevil. And I'm sure comparisons will be made because we're playing the same characters, but I always would hope that wouldn't happen.\n\nI think the show that we made, The Defenders, totally, it doesn't feel like it's part of the same world as the other shows. I don't think. It's got a different vibe to it. If you can take Captain America: The Winter Soldier, that to me feels very different from The Avengers. And I think that's a good comparison. The Defenders, I think, is going to be a little bit more lighthearted. There's going to be more opportunities for tongue-in-cheek humor, and... you know, lightheartedness, without lowering any of the stakes, I hope. There's more levity there.\n\nOne of the things we tried to do very little in Daredevil is when violence exists to try and negate it with a joke. We want the violence to be real and valid, but also not to pretend it's not painful. But in The Defenders, I'm not sure that we quite do that. There's a different feel to it. That's partly because one of the organizations that we come up against is the Hand, and they are a fictional organization that exists outside of common life as we know it, et cetera. So there was more opportunities for that.\n\nYou mentioned the opportunity for levity, and everybody on the internet kind of latched on to those moments with Matt and Jessica in the trailers. What was your relationship with Krysten Ritter like on set? Because there does seem to be these natural pairings, you know, there's Matt and Jessica, and there's Luke and Danny.\n\nI can't say enough good things about Kristen Ritter, I really can't. Me and her had a lot of stuff together, and I think Luke and Danny had a lot of stuff together -- Mike and Finn. But, you know, the highlight of The Defenders for me is working with Krysten. I think she's a phenomenal actor.\n\nShe's also an incredibly inspirational human being, she's a real go-getter. She's a master of many trades, I mean, she's amazing. She's an amazing individual. I loved working with her. She's incredibly funny, and... I'm not traditionally very funny, certainly not that way, so it was really fun for me to try to explore being funny, and I mean, she's knockout funny every time. So I feel like I've got my work cut out for me with her, so it was really fun to try and play those, you know, exchanging witticisms with Krysten Ritter on a regular basis. And I'm pretty sure -- I haven't seen the edit, I haven't seen the show yet -- but I'm pretty sure she wins most of the banters.\n\nYou've worked with [Daredevil and Defenders showrunner] Marco Ramirez quite a bit in the past, and it's tough to ask him this question because he's a little bit closer to his process. But did you see a difference in how he was approaching the material? How different was this for you than Daredevil season 2 was?\n\nI think it's very different. Like I said before, I think the show feels very different. It certainly felt very different to shoot it. But I don't think he has a different approach. I think that was born out of necessity, you know. He's not making a story that centers around one human being. So like, everything that happens in Daredevil has an impact on Matt, and we get to see that impact. And this is a show where the impact affects all four of them, to greater or lesser degrees, you know what I mean?\n\nSo just in terms of structuring the story it's a completely different ball game. I was amazingly impressed by how he was able to take that and run with it. I can't even imagine what it was like for him to write this show with four characters, all whom already exist, three of whom you've never written for. All of those guys have other people who wrote their individual shows, and they've already created the characters he has to try and find the voice of that matches what was already filmed and put on screen. And then he's got to try and tell a story involving all four of those people with conflict, with drama, remaining true to everything that's been done so far. Something like 50 hours of television, or 60 hours or whatever it is. And also make it compelling.\n\nIn terms of some of the acting challenges or even the physical challenges, what was your most challenging moment as Daredevil? It could be as how it relates to what you've done on Defenders or whether Daredevil season 2 or season 1 was easier than this. What stands out to you as something where you're like, \"I don't know if I could do this\"?\n\nI think the thing I found the hardest is... In season 1 of Daredevil, other than Matt Murdock's ability, there wasn't really any in that that was kind of hard, that was kind of a huge step from reality. You know what I mean? It was pretty grounded.\n\nAnd then in Daredevil 2, we introduced the Hand, and that was a real challenge. And of course, they're present in The Defenders story. And I just think that that in itself has been the biggest challenge for me because I've always wanted the show to feel like the emotional impact of what happens to the characters are relatable. Like it really is terrifying. It should feel really scary. And it should feel painful emotionally as well as physically what these characters go through.\n\nI don't think the shows ever want to glamourize violence or what we're doing is really cool. I think one of the great things about these shows is you meet superheroes who are kind of ashamed, in many ways, who are kind of lonely. They don't fit into the world. They feel like freaks of nature, that kind of thing. And they're ashamed about what they're doing, as well as recognizing the importance of it.\n\nI think the biggest challenge for me is when you introduce a organization like the Hand where there's any sort of ambiguity around how these people live and die, whether they can be exterminated, and all that kind of stuff, in order to keep that grounded and real, from an acting perspective, I find that really challenging. Because you also need to pay attention to the tone of the piece. The tone of the piece does not mean -- in The Defenders, at least -- it does not mean sitting around for hours talking about how to possibly explain the craziness of what happened. It's a story that's fueled by plot, and so we need to get on with it. And every now and again, as an actor, I feel frustrated that we haven't as characters been given an appropriate moment on screen to go, \"Hold on, this doesn't make any fucking sense.\" That's the stuff I find the hardest, just kind of balancing having the story that has the mythical elements or supernatural element and try to keep it grounded and real and relatable.\n\nThe shame element that you mentioned, I got that impression with where Matt is in those first two episodes. When that weird quake happens and he goes out, it's like a compulsion. I thought that was really effective.\n\nCool, cool. I will say this. S. J. Clarkson, who's the director of episodes 1 and 2, is a bit of a genius, so I'm not surprised that those first two episodes are great.\n\nWhat do you think everybody's role on the team is?\n\nThere was something that came out of the story that was interesting, which was Danny Rand and Matthew Murdock have experience with these people, with The Hand. So the story for them is already personal. When we get to the point where we realize as a group that The Hand are involved, and we don't know what's going on exactly, but we know what's going on, it's up to Danny and Matt to explain who these people are to the other two, because they've never even heard of them. For them, they have to have that journey of disbelief before they get to that point.\n\nNow Danny and Matt have seen it. They've experienced it, and as hard as it is to explain, we know it exists because we've been there. Jessica and Luke don't have that. Initially at least, the role for Matt and Danny is quite similar. They're the ones that have to bring the other two up-to-date and explain how serious this situation is and how you can't just walk away from it and how dangerous these people are and what they're capable of, blah blah blah. So that was kind of our role.\n\nAnd then Jessica and Luke, the flip side of that is they're the ones that have to go on the journey of disbelief through to \"holy shit\", and getting on board this... If someone says there's ancient evil organization who are capable of destroying an entire civilization, it's very easy for someone like Jessica Jones to say \"Okay good luck with that. I don't believe you or have any interest in being a part of that.\" So... Obviously there's a great story in The Defenders, there's a wonderful plot, and hopefully it sets up and resolve the story in such a way that's satisfactory to the audience. But what's really cool is that you have four people who have absolutely no interest in being part of a team, but who are forced into a situation where they have to work together, and that from a human point of view is really interesting.\n\nHow many seasons of Marvel TV are you signed for?\n\nYou know, I actually don't know that, and I'm afraid to ask. I would always rather not know. I signed the contract just before I auditioned back in 2014, and in that moment, I wasn't focused on that. I was focused on getting the part. And so I actually don't know. I'm just going to keep showing up until they tell me I'm not invited to the party.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100, "id": 540, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 541, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hiddleston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "322329", "label": {"eng": "Tom Hiddleston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boardwalk_Empire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "324560", "label": {"eng": "Boardwalk Empire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "333570", "label": {"eng": "Captain America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Bale", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "354770", "label": {"eng": "Christian Bale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "363641", "label": {"eng": "The Avengers (2012 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "381315", "label": {"eng": "Bucky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "386870", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_period_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1274686", "label": {"eng": "Historical period drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

While The Defenders will bring the main characters from each of the four previous Marvel Netflix show together, they'll need the help of their friends in order to deal with the ancient enemy they'll be facing. With ties to Stick, the Hand, Madame Gao, and more, Alexandra will be like nothing any of the heroes have seen. Luckily, they'll have plenty of assistance.\n\nDaredevil will be joined by Foggy and Karen, with Claire once again lending a hand. We'll also meet Jessica's friends Trish and Malcolm and frenemy Hogarth. Meanwhile, Luke Cage and Danny Rand will bring together Misty Knight and Colleen Wing, teasing the Daughters of the Dragon. We know the main heroes won't all meet in the the first episode, but the various characters and story threads will eventually pull the entire ensemble together for one massive scene. As we await The Defenders' release, clips from the series have been teasing some of the eventual team-ups we'll see on the show.\n\nThe Jessica Jones Twitter account has shared a new clip from The Defenders, briefly teasing the meeting of Trish and Karen as the former learns just how powerful of a threat New York is facing.\n\nSee? I care. #DEFEND pic.twitter.com/2wbHcRk6HF -- Jessica Jones (@JessicaJones)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nThough short, we can see that Karen's work as a journalist for the New York Bulletin will find her connecting the dots of what's going on in The Defenders. Meanwhile, Trish's training should provide Karen with some muscle should the threat come knocking on their door. While Trish may come into her own as a hero in the new show, Karen will likely be dealing with the fallout of Matt revealing his identity to her. We may even get more teases about her mysterious past.\n\nWith The Defenders coming up fast, other clips have helped to set the scene for the show. In a recent one, Matt talks about the death of Elektra to Father Lantom. Of course, his former flame isn't quite dead yet, and will be threatening the heroes alongside Alexandra. And speaking of the villain, yet another clip from the show teased her past with Madame Gao, proving just how dangerous the new character is and how deep her ties to the villains of the MCU go.\n\nAs Friday approaches, more glimpses of the show will make their way online. Though the final trailer has already been released, expect more clips and promos as we inch closer to the debut of The Defenders.\n\nNext: Elektra and Black Widow Stunt Doubles Battle in New Short\n\nThe Defenders premieres on August 18 on Netflix, with The Punisher premiering later in 2017. Additional seasons of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage are expected to air in 2018, with the new season of Iron Fist coming sometime in the future.\n\nSource: Jessica Jones\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

Iron Fist) caught up with TheWrap ahead of the release of Netflix's latest foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \"The Defenders,\" to talk about being part of two of TV's hottest shows.\n\nJones is probably best known for his role as Loras Tyrell, brother to Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer), on HBO's \"Game of Thrones.\" But since Loras and his sister (spoiler!) died at the end of Season 6, Jones has been keeping himself plenty busy as a young New York superhero.\n\nJones opened up about how his \"Defenders\" character, Danny, will fit in with more seasoned heroes Daredevil a.k.a. Matt Murdoch (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) and Luke Cage (Mike Colter). \"It's like he's just met a bunch of older brothers and sisters for the first time,\" Jones said of the relationship with the other heroes.\n\nAlso Read: 'The Defenders' Director on Being a Woman in a Man-Heavy Genre: 'I Don't Know Any Other Way'\n\n\"This is one of the first times that he's run into people that also have abilities. And these people seem to be jaded as well, but have kind of got their s -- together a little bit more than Danny,\" the actor went on to say. \"They're a little bit older and a little bit wiser. And I think Danny is kind of inspired by that, it's like he's found brothers and sisters. And I think that's deeply what Danny has always needed throughout his life, ever since he lost his parents he needs ... that friendship.\"\n\nAlso Read: Sigourney Weaver Steals the Show in the Final 'Defenders' Trailer (Video)\n\nWe'll also see Danny grow up in \"The Defenders,\" completing the character arc set into motion in Season 1 of \"Iron Fist.\"\n\n\"Definitely in 'The Defenders' we're seeing Danny becoming more self-aware, knowing how to deal with his emotions, deal with his responsibility a lot better, and in the process, yes, that means him kind of growing up,\" Jones said. But that doesn't mean Danny will lose his characteristic optimism. \"One of the great things about the hero is he really has got this very pure optimism, but I think his level of naivety is certainly going to become more grounded.\"\n\nAnd that growing up is helped along by the brother/sister figures of Matt, Jessica and Luke. \"We all know what older brothers and sisters do, they kick you in the balls and they tease you, but ultimately it's to help you grow into a better adult,\" he said. \"And I think that's what Danny is experiencing in the Defenders.\"\n\nDanny's optimism certainly shows when the four street-level heroes meet for the first time. \"He needs help,\" Jones explained, saying that Danny is less hesitant than the others to join forces (though you will see Danny have some clashing of personalities, at least at the beginning). \"He's been trying to track down members of the hand for a while now and he keeps not making any progress ... I think on an emotional level and a much deeper level, he's longed for friendship, longed for allies, and he's longed for a connection to people that understand him.\"\n\nAs for his relationship with friend/sidekick/martial arts badass Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick), Jones said it's strained at the beginning of \"The Defenders.\"\n\n\"Definitely tensions are starting to fray with them. Just because Danny -- he can be very hot-headed, buried in his own head at times because he has so much on his plate and he doesn't really know how to handle it.\" By the end of Season 1 of \"The Defenders,\" however, \"Danny is kind of in more of a position to give more to the relationship, to be more present in the relationship. And I think that will help steady them going in to Season 2.\"\n\nJones is confident in Danny's superpowers, too -- so much so that he believes the superhero would beat his flowery counterpart from Westeros.\n\n\"Loras is always a showman, he was a jouster, a knight of the summer, as it was explained in the book,\" Jones said. \"He never knew what it felt like to be on the battlefield, to be actually in sort of fight or flight combat. Whereas Danny has got more experience hand to hand. And, he also has the Iron Fist. So that kind of trumps Loras just from the get-go. But if Danny didn't have the Iron Fist I still think [he] would take Loras down in hand to hand combat.\"\n\nThe first season of \"The Defenders\" premieres Aug. 18 on Netflix.\n\nRead original story

In their early report from The Defenders set, Entertainment Weekly reported that, Ritter had shot most of her scenes to that point with Daredevil actor Charlie Cox. She described their relationship as having a \"cat-and-mouse\" quality.\n\nBoth of these characters are, however unwillingly, working together to save New York City from the deluge of villains in and around the Hell's Kitchen area in The Defenders. But their methods could not be more different. Law school trained and intensely disciplined Matt could easily despise the barely functional mess that is Jessica Jones, and vice versa.\n\n\"No one's best friends in all of the Defenders,\" Ritter told EW in the same story. \"This is a reluctant team-up.\" Marvel seems pretty enthusiastic about the idea that Jones and Murdock just won't be able to get along -- even the shows' official Twitter accounts are constantly bickering.\n\nBut even bickering is new ground for these two characters. In the comics, Jessica Jones and Matt Murdock's biggest connection came about when Jessica became Matt's bodyguard for a handful of Daredevil issues. In The Defenders, it seems that they'll be constantly at odds... but is it possible that they'll find that they have some romantic chemistry underneath that?\n\n\"I think both Jessica Jones and Matt Murdock are quite... opinionated and quite stubborn,\" Cox said in EW's behind-the-scenes video. I imagine that would be kind of a fiery relationship... in a good way. His description sounds a lot like the way Luke and Jessica's relationship got started back in Jessica Jones Season 1, which could be a sign of impending fireworks.\n\nSpeaking of, Jessica's comic-canonical love interest is Luke Cage, which is probably why the two hooked up and even started dating during her solo show. But after Jessica revealed that she was partially responsible for the death of Luke's wife while under the influence of Kilgrave, they had a pretty unconventional breakup. As of his own spinoff show, Luke Cage is now balancing his flirtatious friendship with Misty Knight and his ongoing relationship with Claire. In New Avengers issue \"Happily Ever After,\" Jessica marries Luke Cage, but that doesn't really seem like something TV Jessica is ready to do. Even if that's where they eventually headed, it doesn't rule out a fling with Matt.\n\nThe comics don't set a romantic path for this prospective couple. So if Matt and Jessica form a relationship of any kind in The Defenders, it will break new ground for the pair.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Arts_and_Entertainment", "wgt": 100, "id": 424, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Arts and Entertainment"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Self-Help", "wgt": 100, "id": 544, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Self-Help"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100, "id": 679, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 100, "id": 680, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 1010, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Magazines_and_E-zines", "wgt": 100, "id": 1619, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Magazines and E-zines"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Kitchen,_Manhattan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217604"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303532", "label": {"eng": "Television program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304816", "label": {"eng": "Character (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "313045", "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "321274", "label": {"eng": "Friendship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "419854", "label": {"eng": "The New Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Man", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "531012", "label": {"eng": "Purple Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "547406", "label": {"eng": "Misty Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}]}

See, the Defenders of TV and the Defenders of the comics may call themselves the same thing, but otherwise they're almost nothing alike.\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe has already featured the two of the three original Defenders -- but not on Netflix. Doctor Strange, the Incredible Hulk, and Namor the Sub-Mariner (one of Marvel's oldest comic characters, and delightfully assholish King of Atlantis) first came together in the pages of each of their respective comics in 1969 and 1970. The Doctor Strange series had been canceled mid-arc, so writer Roy Thomas simply carried on Strange's last story in Hulk and Sub-Mariner, turning it into a team-up special that saw the heroes unite to fight off an invasion of Lovecraftian horrors. A year later Thomas would create another trio, this time featuring Namor, Hulk, and the Silver Surfer, but the original three reunited and were officially designated as \"The Defenders\" in the first issue of Marvel Feature in December 1971.\n\nThe Silver Surfer remained absent from the story thanks to an edict by Stan Lee asking that he write all of the cosmic surfboarder's stories -- but when the team's debut proved to be overwhelmingly popular, the Defenders were given their own series, and Lee quickly approved of new writer Steve Engleheart's pitch to bring the Surfer into the Defenders fold by the second issue. Four issues into the run Asgardian warrior Valkyrie -- the spirit of an Asgardian named Brunnhilde living in the host body of a human woman named Barbara Denton-Norriss -- officially joined the line-up, and the classic Defenders were born.\n\nGiven the complex range of heroes on the team, the sort of missions that came under the Defenders' purview was much vaster in scope than that of Netflix's heroes. They fought everything from alien wizards (like Yandroth, a \"technomancer\" from an alternate dimension whose giant robot body became one of the first villains the Defenders fought together), to actual eldritch horrors like Null the Lifeless, a many-eyed, many-tentacled physical embodiment of the vengeful souls of a race of winged aliens from the moon.\n\nThe weirdness wasn't just consigned to cosmic foes, either: the Defenders' bread and butter was in dealing with the depths of the supernatural. From iconic Marvel demons like the scheming Mephisto -- who's probably best known for infamously annulling Spider-Man's marriage to Mary Jane Watson -- to long-time Doctor Strange foe Dormammu, the Defenders went to hell and back, some times literally, to take the fight to the paranormal. That even includes a time they actually fought Satan himself, thanks to the team's longtime alliance with Satan's son, Damian Hellstrom. They even occasionally had the time to fight \"normal\" supervillains, too!\n\nIn the early years of Defenders comics, the group was a much-less formal team than the Avengers -- they were more like a group of friends and acquaintances who happened to go out and save the world every once in a while. That also meant that the Defenders' membership was a revolving door that spun faster than any of the ones at Avengers tower.\n\nA few staple characters would emerge in the '70s alongside the primary five Defenders: Hellcat, a.k.a Patsy Walker, the Marvel romance-star-turned-supernatural-superheroine who would go on to be a major supporting character in the Jessica Jones Netflix series; Gargoyle, a human whose spirit was put inside the body of a gargoyle after a demonic deal gone wrong, and who was originally tasked with fighting the team; and Nighthawk, Marvel's infamous Batman knockoff, and former leader of the supervillain team Squadron Sinister. But the team's laissez-faire approach to membership lead to heroes from all walks of life in Marvel's comics, famous and obscure, joining and departing the group. Heroes like Luke Cage, Hawkeye, and even Hank Pym (in his Yellowjacket persona rather than as Ant- or Giant-Man) stopped by in the mid-'70s for loose alliances with the team. But the team still operated mostly in secret, until the story \"Defenders for a Day.\"\n\nAfter a Defenders documentary about the team -- and their lax approach to hiring new recruits -- was aired to the public, interest in joining the team spiked, dozens of heroes showed up at the Defender's no-longer-secret headquarters hoping to join (and promptly quit a few issues later once the mania died down). Among those temporary Defenders was the Iron Fist, joining Luke as the only two members of the Netflix show's lineup to have formally been a member of the Defenders in the comics. (That's right: Daredevil, Netflix's \"First Defender,\" has never actually been a Defender.)\n\nBy the early '80s, however, big changes were coming to the Defenders. In a bid to shake-up the series the title was re-branded as The New Defenders from issue 125, and Doctor Strange, Namor, Hulk, and Silver Surfer were removed from the series -- due to a newly-revealed prophecy that claimed should the four unite again, they'd be responsible for the end of the world. Although key players from the '70s like Gargoyle, Valkyrie, and Hellcat remained, the departure of the original team lead to the rebirth of the Defenders as a much more formal organization, led by X-Men's Beast (who had joined the team 10 issues earlier) and now featuring other familiar mutant heroes like original X-Men Angel and Iceman, alongside new members like future Guardians of the Galaxy member and telepathic martial artist Moondragon, as regular characters.\n\nThis more structured superhero team take on the Defenders wasn't to last. Although the changeover to the new team had drawn increased interest and The New Defenders performed well saleswise, Marvel decided to cancel the series 27 issues later in 1986 to help establish a new roster of series. The final issue saw Moondragon, possessed by a psychic demon conveniently named the Dragon of the Moon, betray (after seeing visions of her teammates talking behind her back, of all things!) and slaughter several of her fellow Defenders, freeing up the remaining mutants on the team to join the newly-created X-Men spinoff team X-Factor as per an editorial request. To make the end of the Defenders series seem even more pointlessly publisher-mandated, several of the killed heroes, including Valkyrie and Gargoyle, were resurrected almost immediately in other series to ensure that at least some of the original team lived on elsewhere.\n\nOver the next two decades, the Defenders concept would attempt several reboots and returns. The original Defenders reunited for two storylines in 1990 -- in which they discovered that the prophecy that drove them apart was an elaborate hoax designed to, well, drive them apart -- but the team would not get its own comic again until 1993's Secret Defenders, and even then it was radically unlike what came before. Even though the original team had discovered they could work together again without dooming the world, only Doctor Strange returned, and in an homage to the original series' rotating cast, each issue saw Strange recruit a new team of Defenders for a one-off mission, disbanding them upon completion to keep the Defenders' return a secret.\n\nThis meant the series could feature big-name Marvel heroes who otherwise couldn't commit to a formal team -- Wolverine, Spider-Man, Captain America, Scarlet Witch, and more made appearances -- but the series quickly hit troubled waters when Marvel removed Doctor Strange himself from the series to join the supernatural team Midnight Sons. Although leadership of the Secret Defenders would continue under the guidance of a far less popular character -- Strange's fellow mystic Doctor Druid -- without Strange Secret Defenders itself would last just 25 issues in total, ending in 1995.\n\nIt would take Marvel another six years to attempt a Defenders relaunch -- this time with a curse bringing the team together again rather than forcing them apart. Hexed to always unite and respond to grave threats to Earth, the original four Defenders were once again reborn a superhero team... for just 12 issues, when it was revealed that the aforementioned techno-wizard Yandroth, one of the team's earliest foes, was actually behind the curse that reunited them. Yandroth dominated the minds of the four Defenders, reforging them as \"The Order\" for a six-part follow-up miniseries that saw the return of Hellcat, Valkyrie, and Gargoyle to save their friends from being turned into world-controlling madmen. At the end of the series, the Defenders were disbanded once again -- this time seemingly for good.\n\nSo what's up with the Defenders now? Several attempts have been made to bring the team back since The Defenders and The Order at the turn of the 21st century. A 2005 comedic miniseries re-imagined the team as a dysfunctional group sick of trying to reform after several attempts, while The Last Defenders saw Tony Stark help form a post-Civil War team -- lead by Nighthawk, and featuring She-Hulk, Colossus, and the incredibly obscure Marvel hero Blazing Skull, who has a flaming skull for a head but is not related to fellow flaming-skull-owner Ghost Rider -- as part of his \"50 State Initiative.\" He assigning the new Defenders to New Jersey, but the team was quickly disbanded due to gross incompetence by Tony; Nighthawk later reformed the team (adding back Damian Hellstrom as a team member to replace Colossus) as a secret superhero squad acting outside of government influence, but they were sadly never seen again.\n\nThe 2011 event series Fear Itself ultimately lead to two more attempts to get a Defenders book up and running. The first, launching in 2011, brought together the original team of Doctor Strange, Namor, and Silver Surfer, alongside the Red She-Hulk and Iron Fist for a kooky, irreverent series, but it was sadly canceled after 12 issues. A quasi-follow up in 2013 called Fearless Defenders imagined an all-female group of heroes, led by Misty Knight and Valkyrie, that followed a similar style. Sadly, however, it ultimately met a similar fate and was canceled just a month after Netflix and Marvel announced a deal to bring a new team of Defenders to the streaming service.\n\nThat ultimately brings us to 2017, and the arrival of a new ongoing Defenders comic -- this time much smaller and much less weird than the series that started it all nearly five decades ago. Written by Jessica Jones co-creator Brian Michael Bendis, the new Defenders series pulls inspiration directly from the Netflix shows rather than the teams that came before, with Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Danny Rand, and Matt Murdock coming together to tackle crime on the streets of New York.\n\nSure, it looks a lot more like the TV show you're going to start binge-watching this Friday, but unless Yandroth comes back for anther rematch, it looks like it will barely scratch the surface of the Defenders' long, bizarre comics history.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri":

Here's a look at what you should expect from it.\n\nThe Defenders is a series based on Stan Lee's comic books for Marvel. Daredevil/Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter), and Danny Rand/Iron Fist (Finn Jones), a quartet of singular heroes comes together for one common goal - to save New York City. These four solitary figures are also burdened with their own personal challenges. But quickly they realise that they just might be stronger when teamed together to fight against a centuries old sinister organisation led by Sigourney Weaver's character Alexandra.\n\nDuring the course of the show, all the familiar faces from Marvel's small universe on Netflix make appearances. Claire Temple (Rosario Dawson), Stick (Scott Glenn), Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll), Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson), Jeri Hogarth (Carrie-Anne Moss), Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor), Misty Knight (Simone Missick) and Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) do their duty of taking the plot forward.\n\nLet's get the bad things out first. Marvel suffered their biggest set back when Iron Fist received harsh reactions from fans and critics alike. Finn Jones still doesn't help his case. His billionaire hippie becomes the butt of jokes despite the importance that character's arc demands. Carrying his bland performance becomes the show's Achilles Heel.\n\nMike Colter and Krysten Ritter fit rather well in the mould of things. Ritter's Jessica is reluctant and acerbic as ever. But it's her bantering scenes with Charlie Cox that hold the potential for fan fiction worth reams of paper. Colter's Cage is trying to be a messiah for Harlem's kids. But unlike his first attempt in a stand alone series, this effort feels half hearted. His is the most run-of-the-mill arc where he has to maintain the work-superhero life balance.\n\nSigourney Weaver is the MVP of The Defenders. The writers did a great job of penning her and Elodie Yung's evil characters. They are strong women with even stronger motivations. And Weaver's movements define the power she yields. Her measured icy expressions are bone chilling. And her wardrobe on the show is worth stealing.\n\nCinematographer Matthew J Lloyd deserves a special mention for the lighting of the scenes and some smart screen transitions.\n\nFor Sigourney Weaver. The way she breathes life into Alexandra's character, I don't think anybody else was capable of that.\n\nFor Charlie Cox's subtle acting. Matthew Murdock's struggle with Catholic guilt and re-engaging with the underbelly of the Big Apple provide fine opportunities for the British actor.\n\nFor Mike Colter and Krysten Ritter's ease.\n\nIf your hatred for Finn Jones ruining Iron Fist runs deeper than the Nile towards the Mediterranean, avoid it.\n\nMarvel's attempt to bring all the superheroes of Netflix shows together was never going to be the grand affair Joss Whedon created with The Avengers. But these are modest stories that deserve a chance to be told.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri":

The final Defenders trailer teases us with our longest look yet at bad guy Alexandra (Sigourney Weaver). And she's just the right kind of evil.\n\nIn the other previews for the series, we've already seen the dynamic between the Defenders is shaky at best. Jessica and Luke are still pissed at each other, Daredevil likes to work alone, and everybody is making fun of poor Iron Fist. We've heard some funny one-liners zipping among our heroes and the repeated refrain that they are not, definitely not, a team. But they're going to have to become one to defeat Alexandra.\n\nWeaver plays Alexandra as smooth, cool, and in control. We know almost nothing about her because she's not from the Marvel comics, so she has been created just for this show. Based on the trailers, she appears to be some kind of corporate overlord, bringing violent new meaning to \"hostile takeover.\" She's also a master manipulator, trying to bring the Defenders over to her side (she's already working with Elektra). \"We're not so different,\" she coos to them in a previous trailer. \"We fight to get back what was once ours.\"\n\nWhen it comes to sorting out who Alexandra is, I'm especially curious about one line in the new trailer. When the Defenders ask what she wants, Alexandra says, \"The same thing I've always wanted. To bring light into the dark. To bring life where there is death.\" It makes me wonder whether she's a figure like the biotech corporate maniac Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton) in the recent Netflix film Okja. Is she working on some kind of life-extension tech, or is she after something that will create more people like the inexplicably strong Jessica and Luke?\n\nI also think it's crucial that Alexandra be a fascinating, charismatic villain. One of the best parts of Luke Cage was the way Mariah became such an amoral mastermind, despite having the seemingly benign goal of elevating the people of Harlem. Alexandra wants to do good things for humanity, too, or so it seems. We have plenty of villains like Thanos, who are tautologically evil (bad because bad). I'd always rather watch a bad guy who has done the dark psychological work of twisting her worthy ideals into something horrific.\n\nCan't wait to binge on this series over the weekend.\n\nListing image by Netflix", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 541, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 577, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "wgt": 100, "id": 636, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trucking", "wgt": 100, "id": 696, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Trucking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Manga", "wgt": 100, "id": 789, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Manga"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action-Adventure", "wgt": 100, "id": 1033, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action-Adventure"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "wgt": 100, "id": 1179, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harlem"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217579"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "331771", "label": {"eng": "Thanos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilda_Swinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "386848", "label": {"eng": "Tilda Swinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okja", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1323449", "label": {"eng": "Okja"}}]}

Or as Stick refers to them, \"the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, the smart-ass detective, the righteous ex-con, and and the kid with the glowing fist.\" Even here, Danny Rand gets the short end of things.\n\nWhile New York City's future is at stake, the four Defenders are each trying to figure out their lives and who they want to be individually before they can even start to come together (that's a hint at how long it takes them to actually come together as a team). As Colter points out, though, \"it's not about us; that's what being a hero is.\"\n\nThis featurette recycles most of the dialogue and action sequences we've seen before, which are definite highlights of the first four episodes.

Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) is still finding redemption at the bottom of a bottle while running from her superhero identity, trying in vain to fight the popularity surge after defeating nemesis Kilgrave (David Tennant). Luke Cage (Mike Colter) returns from his brief prison exile and proceeds in his endeavour to keep the kids off the streets in Harlem. And finally, millionaire kid Danny Rand/Iron Fist (Finn Jones) is hot on the heels of the Hand, the sinister organisation that's on a mission of world domination or some such, with sidekick/lover Collen Wing (Jessica Henwick).\n\nAnd it's with this final hero that the showrunners get ingeniously sneaky: By putting Iron Fist at the forefront of this story, they give him a chance at redemption from all the negative press he received early this year over whitewashing allegations in his debut series. In the first four episodes, we see Rand take all the punches: his white privilege and relationship with big money (as a 50 per cent shareholder of Rand Enterprises, he's basically swimming in billions) is constantly questioned and he's shown taking time to address these issues earnestly and with honest intentions.\n\nAs a foil to his much-older and world weary companions, Iron Fist works astonishingly well, infusing fresh blood into the tired tropes of the sulky-brooding vigilante. Young, hot-blooded and morally incorruptible, Rand sees no options: you fight or die trying. This is in huge contrast to the existential confusion that belays characters like Daredevil and Jessica Jones.\n\nAlso, cloaking some of Rand's personality flaws is his relationship with Luke Cage: the two are old buddies from their comic-book days. While their small-screen introduction to each other doesn't go down too well, as expected, the development of their friendship is done with a light touch and heart-warming humour.\n\nThis is not to say that the other characters are just sitting around. While the four of them only come together by the middle of episode three, which is a pretty long time to take considering there are only eight episodes to go around, the time's not all wasted. By giving each character the space to come to terms with the magnitude of what they are about to face, the series of events that follow feel more lived in and natural.\n\nAnd when they do come together, sparks fly. The characters are allowed to play off each other's personalities in different ways, creating unique bonds, like the afore-mentioned Cage/Rand. The defenders' first action scene together, a beautifully choreographed piece, set to hip-hop music and sans major CGI, could easily put the pomp and bombast of the Avengers to shame.\n\nWhile the general enemy they're facing is still the Hand, a carry-over from both Daredevil and Iron Fist, the face of the Hand has now changed. More powerful than Kingpin (Vincent D'Onfrio) or Madame Gao (Wai Ching Ho), Alexandra Weaver, played to perfection by genre goddess Sigourney Weaver, is the embodiment of all the evilness in the real world today. The understated menace that shines through her perfectly groomed visage and pleasant manners is both, exciting and terrifying.\n\nHelping matters along are all the tertiary characters from the previous Netflix Marvel series, who mostly happen to be badass women (and will hopefully lead their own miniseries some day) -- Elodie Yung as Elektra Natchios/Black Sky, Claire Temple (Rossario Dawson), Misty Knight (Simone Missick), Jeri Hogarth (Carrie-Ann Moss) and Trish Walker (Rachel Taylor).

The Defenders aren't just the Marvel Cinematic Universe's street-level heroes, they all punch things really hard -- and that's part of what makes them so unique.\n\nWhen Netflix and Marvel first announced their plans to buff out the larger MCU with new series of shows all set in New York City, it made sense that the characters they chose to highlight would have relatively modest powers compared to their big-screen cousins. In Marvel's comics, heroes like Doctor Strange, the Silver Surfer, Valkyrie, and the Hulk have all been counted among the Defenders' ranks at one time or another, but between those characters' current obligations elsewhere in Marvel's films and obvious budget constraints, it would have been nearly impossible to bring them to the small screen.\n\nHow convenient, then, that Marvel and Netflix's modern TV version of the team consists of a bunch of relatively normal people who all just so happen to be very good at punching people. Although their powers work in somewhat different ways, at the end of the day Jessica, Luke, Danny, and Matt are going to spend the Defenders TV series taking on the Hand with their fists.\n\nThis might not immediately seem like a big deal -- who better to fight undead ninjas than a group of fighters? -- but there's things to be said for the ways in which we use the variance of superheroes' power sets to define a team's dynamics, and how The Defenders ignores that rule completely.\n\nDaredevil may be decked out in full body armor and have heightened senses and years of proper training, but one well-placed punch or kick from Jessica would quite literally send him flying due to her enormous strength. Jessica may be strong enough to pin Luke's arms down while they're getting busy, but actually trying to hit his super-dense skin with her bare hands would likely end with her doing more damage to herself than him. We know that Danny's fully charged iron fist is capable of hurting Luke, but Luke can take a punch and Danny can only use the iron fist once every couple of hours.\n\nDespite having variations of the same type of powers, the Defenders are balanced among one another in a way that emphasizes how the thing that really sets them apart from one another are their personalities. Individually, Netflix's Marvel series have all done a solid job of placing their titular characters at the center of their stories in a way that's made each of their journeys, drives, and natures feel distinct from one another -- perhaps to a fault. Unlike a lot of other motley super-crews whose members may briefly bristle at the idea of working together, it's legitimately kind of difficult to image Jessica, Luke, Matt, and Danny as team, let alone a group of friends.\n\nWhereas the Suicide Squad and the Avengers have something of an obligation to do their hero work, the Defenders are just a handful of unusually strong people with virtually nothing in common. Even in the best of circumstances, none of them would get along too well, and even though they're teaming up for Defenders, there's no question that each of them considers themselves more of a loner. Unlike other superhero teams that have at least one person the others look to as the \"leader\" of the group, The Defenders subverts that trope by putting its heroes on a relatively level playing field (physically) and revels into the fact that they're a group of Type-As.\n\nIn the first Avengers, there's a scene where Bruce Banner insists that he and the other heroes aren't a team, but rather a time bomb -- a powerful statement of their instability, but not exactly one that's borne out well on-screen. The Defenders, by comparison, aren't a time bomb as much as a collection of mismatched parts, jury-rigged together in spite of the fact that they're incompatible. It's in the inherent flawed-ness of their relationships that allows us to see who they are as people, and that's what makes them compelling to watch.\n\nAs we get deeper into shared cinematic universes with crossovers like Infinity War, it's going to become increasingly important for superhero movies to remember that on-screen spectacle can ultimately fall flat if there isn't a beating human heart at the story's center. Defenders seems to be built around that understanding, and the series will likely be immeasurably stronger for it.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 541, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 100, "id": 712, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302515", "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_Squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303362", "label": {"eng": "Suicide Squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "311296", "label": {"eng": "Hulk (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313028", "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_bomb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "330462", "label": {"eng": "Time bomb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Strange", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "368593", "label": {"eng": "Doctor Strange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Surfer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "481678", "label": {"eng": "Silver Surfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_television_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1329046", "label": {"eng": "List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series"}}]}

Sarah Schatz/Netflix\n\nJust like Marvel's The Avengers was the culmination of the studio's careful Phase 1 plotting featuring multiple individual heroes joining forces, Netflix's The Defenders is the culmination of a similar small screen build up, albeit one with lighter stakes. The Defenders will see Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist, along with several supporting cast members from all four series, come together in a battle for New York City. No, it isn't quite the world-ending consequences of The Avengers, but the formula is the same.\n\nBut how closely do the two team-ups resemble one another? Or how far does The Defenders stray from its predecessor's winning strategy? Showrunner Marco Ramirez discussed the comparisons in a recent interview with THR.\n\nWhen you have literally the footprints that The Avengers had, there's kind of no way to avoid the comparison and no way to avoid referencing it in the writers room. It's an incredible achievement and a great story told really well. But to me, aside from that, in the formation of the show in the writers room, it was important to me to talk about story templates and influences. We talked about The Dirty Dozen and Seven Samurai. We talked about movies and cinematic stories where characters came together who did not want to come together, who had their own in-fighting but ultimately came together to fight something bad in some way. I would like to think the influences are wide in that way.\n\nSo far, that strategy appears to be working as The Defenders has received mostly positive reviews. More importantly, though, is what the miniseries represents: a long-term event show that has intrigued viewers ever since Daredevil first premiered in 2015. Netflix has tapped into the Marvel Cinematic Universe's tendency to give audiences a taste of what's coming next to keep them on the hook. This stands in contrast to the traditional Netflix viewing model which sees users binge entire seasons in one weekend only for the shows to be forgotten shortly after.\n\nFortunately, even if you haven't kept up with Marvel's burgeoning Netflix empire, Ramirez has structured The Defenders in a way to allow new viewers to hop in without any preexisting knowledge of the shared small screen universe.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 959, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Organizations"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308296", "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dirty_Dozen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "318525", "label": {"eng": "The Dirty Dozen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "342018", "label": {"eng": "The Avengers (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "349310", "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "363641", "label": {"eng": "The Avengers (2012 film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Samurai", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "512781", "label": {"eng": "Seven Samurai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

Weaver's casting is flawless for the role, bringing gravitas and menace to a character who is also desperately vulnerable in ways we won't spoil.\n\nThe first four episodes of The Defenders released to critics have gotten solid reviews (I can also attest that it's pretty good), and it looks like the miniseries is shaping up to do a solid job of bringing all these characters together into one story. It takes too much time ramping up, wastes its resources on unnecessary characters and subplots and lacks the visual appeal of Marvel's previous Netflix outings.\n\nThe counterpoint is that The Defenders is, by its nature, nearly totally inaccessible to newcomers.\n\nThis leaves Luke and Jessica (who already have a pre-existing relationship as seen in the first season of Jessica Jones) dubious of the \"ancient evil organization who are capable of destroying an entire civilization\".\n\nThat makes the ponderous set-up even more confusing.\n\nFor those who have fully invested in the franchise though, The Defenders showrunner Marco Ramirez seems to have responded subtly to viewer reception of earlier shows. The reluctance of Jones and the others to formally come together, and then endlessly bickering when they do, is actually a nice nod to the very different origins of The Defenders in the comics.\n\nMarvel's The Defenders is set to debut on Netflix on August 18, 2017.\n\n\u25a0 \"Alien: Covenant\", the sixth film in the series, detours a ship filled with colonists en route to populate a new world and drops them on a planet filled with ... well, you know how it works.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315611", "label": {"eng": "Chinese martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349310", "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "349438", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "373554", "label": {"eng": "Ensemble cast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

Though all of the stories are united by their New York setting and street-level focus (no flying Iron Man-esque suits or magic hammers are to be found), they've so far been easy to distinguish from one another in terms of their look: Daredevil is all reds and blacks, Jessica Jones is draped in blues and purples, Luke Cage is as golden as sunshine, and Iron Fist is fixated on greens and yellows. Key to conveying that imagery, of course, is the costuming. Enter Stephanie Maslansky.\n\nMaslansky has been the lead costumer for each of those Marvel Netflix series, joining up right at the beginning with 2015's first Daredevil season. With the exception of Daredevil's battle suit, she's the costuming genius behind all the outfits worn by Matt, Jessica, Luke, and Danny -- and she's back at it again with their team-up show, The Defenders, which premieres on August 18. The Defenders presents the unique challenge of meshing all those various costumes into a seamless whole, and Vulture caught up with Maslansky to talk about her journey with Marvel and how she pulled all of her work together for the new series.\n\nBy the time she got recruited for Daredevil, Maslansky was already a veteran of gritty, urbane shows like Oz, Third Watch, and Law & Order: Criminal Intent. But she had no superhero experience. That was just fine, as Marvel wasn't looking for anything too superhero-y. Instead, they wanted someone who could capture the city in which Daredevil would take place. \"I think I'm a New York-centric costume designer and I'm a big observer of people in New York,\" Maslansky said. \"I feel that I've been sort of gearing up for something like this for quite some time with the particular experiences I've had doing costume design.\"\n\nWhen she got the Daredevil gig, she immediately consulted the comics from which it sprung. \"Where I landed and what really influenced me was how he was drawn in the mid-'60s, which was such a great look, mid-century men's style,\" she recalls. Though it may have originated 50 years ago, Maslansky felt that it had contemporary relevance. \"It's just a little bit different from today because silhouettes are slimmer, but there's been a resurgence of narrow ties or narrow lapels and slimmer trousers and I really wanted to keep Matt Murdock's look very strongly reflective of that style. I really considered it a uniform that he wore in the comic book illustrations.\"\n\nBut her most clever choice related to Murdock's blindness. \"I just imagined that, as a blind man, he would limit his palettes so that anything that he went to his closet to get would go with anything else, so his palette was black, gray, navy blue,\" Maslansky says. \"In that way, no matter what he chose out of his closet, it always worked. He didn't have to worry about it.\"\n\nNext came Jessica Jones, and there, she thought about the results of the title character's trauma as a result of being raped and abused by the villainous Kilgrave. \"She started drinking more,\" Maslansky says. \"Really just tried to get through life without being noticed in a certain sort of way. That was reflected in the way she dressed: Her uniform is jean jacket, light-blue jeans, ankle boots, and then a T-shirt or two. She had about five pairs of the same jeans so that when one was too dirty, she just put on the other pair when she woke up with a hangover in the morning. She just grabbed the pair that was nearest to her.\"\n\nThe key to Jessica's look is her leather jacket. The inspiration for it came partly from the early-aughts comics in which the character originated, and partly from the actor who plays her, Krysten Ritter. \"In the comic book illustrations, she wore more of a blazer-style leather jacket and one of the important things about what we were doing here was updating everything to 2015,\" Maslansky says. Ergo a smaller piece that sits higher on her body. But Ritter had final say: \"Ultimately, she was the one who chose. A lot of leather jackets are tried on, and the one that she wound up in was an Acme jacket.\" It got beaten up during the shooting a few times, but Ritter stepped in there, too. \"If the jacket ever ripped,\" Maslansky says, \"she would just have it repaired or repair it herself.\"\n\nLuke, like Jessica, is partially defined by past trauma -- in his case, torture in prison and the loss of his beloved wife. Maslansky once again used that as inspiration, but the results were quite different. Of particular importance is Luke's black hoodie with a golden-yellow inner lining. \"I sort of created a backstory for that sweatshirt with the yellow interior, and that backstory was that he had originally was given that sweatshirt by his wife,\" Maslansky recalls.\n\nDanny Rand, the hero of Iron Fist, had to look radically different from his Defenders counterparts because his backstory is so wild: A rich boy from New York, Danny was stranded in the Far East and raised by warrior monks to be a mystical living weapon before traveling more or less on foot back to his hometown. In other words, leather jackets and jeans were out. When he returns to New York in Iron Fist, he has a look that's \"practically homeless,\" as Maslansky puts it, but that isn't to last either. Once he steps into the boardroom, what's he supposed to look like?\n\n\"I wanted to reflect the guy that suddenly comes into money and has to be this CEO character all a sudden and wear a suit,\" she says. \"I thought, okay, this is the guy that's been barefoot for 15 years. What would he wear on his feet? Even with a suit? I thought, 'Well, he's going to wear sneakers. Really high-end sneakers.' He's got the money to spend on great sneakers. It happens to be a style that fits with this whole athleisure movement. People do that. They wear sneakers with everything.\"\n\nOf course, Danny isn't always in the office. You can't have a Marvel Netflix show without some beat-'em-ups. \"When he got into fighting, his look just became more casual,\" Maslansky says. \"He wore a lot of black. He also wore hoodies, but more high-end hoodies than what Luke Cage wears. Luke Cage being kind of a working-man's hero, whereas the hoodies and sweats that Danny Rand wears are a far more sleek and more technical fabric, and just higher end, a little slimmer.\"\n\nOnce all those looks were established, it was time to unify them in one place for The Defenders. How would they all interlock? The quick answer: They don't, and that's just how Maslansky likes it. \"I will say that it became less about how to make them all blend together than to just celebrate their differences, celebrate their individual color palettes, and to really shoot in that direction,\" she says. However, there are still bits of meshing, though you may not notice them right away.\n\n\"As the episodes go on, with characters crossing to each other's lands and stories, a decision needed to be made: Are we going to shoot the Luke Cage palette or are we going to shoot the Daredevil palette? The Jessica Jones or the Iron Fist?\" Maslansky says. \"If a Luke Cage character came into Jessica Jones's world, we shifted the color palette toward Jessica Jones's world. So you might see, for example, if Misty Knight is interviewing Jessica Jones, Misty Knight is wearing blue as opposed to her usual Luke Cage colors. Just keep your eyes open when you see the series and you might recognize some of this.\"\n\nThough Maslansky is responsible for coming up with all these costumes, she isn't the only one constructing looks in the Marvel Netflix world. There are, of course, all the cosplayers paying tribute to her work. She loves them dearly. \"Oh my God, it's just a thrill,\" she says of seeing cosplayers. \"I love it. I think, 'My God, they're dressed like how I designed these characters.' It's really a huge compliment. These characters are so beloved and they're so popular, and this whole cosplay movement is very interesting to me.\"\n\nThere's one thing Maslansky has kept out of her mind: the Marvel movies. Although the Netflix shows are ostensibly set in the same universe, she says she no interest in using the bright primary colors of an Iron Man or a Thor. That said, she's interested in the challenge that might entail. \"There are rumors that those worlds are going to cross over,\" Maslansky says, though she's careful to point out that they're just external rumors and not edicts from within Marvel itself. \"I've still yet to see any indication that that's going to happen, but when and if it does, I am happy to rise to the occasion and address it then.\" No offense to Captain America, but Jessica Jones is way better at street style.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing", "wgt": 100, "id": 177, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing", "wgt": 100, "id": 421, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100, "id": 679, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 100, "id": 680, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Costumes", "wgt": 100, "id": 881, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Costumes"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Living_History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 882, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Living History/By Topic"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Ethnic_and_Regional", "wgt": 100, "id": 924, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Ethnic and Regional"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304209", "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304816", "label": {"eng": "Character (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306362", "label": {"eng": "Trousers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307592", "label": {"eng": "Leather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309419", "label": {"eng": "Iron Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311616", "label": {"eng": "Hoodie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345049", "label": {"eng": "Law & Order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Television", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "386876", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Man", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "531012", "label": {"eng": "Purple Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "547406", "label": {"eng": "Misty Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "719668", "label": {"eng": "Third Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_television_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1329046", "label": {"eng": "List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series"}}]}

The trailer is all about Sigourney Weaver's mysterious villain Alexandra, who promises to rain hell down on the newly formed foursome.\n\nThe trailer starts by offering up another tidbit to add to our short but growing list of things we know about Alexandra: she's a sucker for fortune cookies. She makes this reveal when she meets up with the series' central heroes, Matt Murdock/Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter), and Danny Rand/Iron Fist (Finn Jones), alongside Scott Glenn's Stick, at the Chinese restaurant that has popped up in many of the show's trailers thus far.\n\n\"You know, I thought it would be a good idea if we all talked this over like adults,\" she says. Stick fires back by asking what she wants, to which she replies, \"The same thing I've always wanted. To bring light into the dark. To bring life where there is death.\" As Luke rightfully points out, though, Alexandra, despite all her talk of life, has a nasty habit of killing a lot of people.\n\n\"I can see you formed a bond here,\" Alexandra says, as images of the Defenders and their friends from their individual series in action flash by. \"I promise you it's temporary. They will disappoint you. And if I might give you some advice, the more connections you have, the easier it will be to break you. You need to think this through. New York is so densely populated.\"\n\nOf course, as the trailer shows, the team has no intention of taking Alexandra's words to heart, with Matt quickly pointing out that the only way out of their situation is together. Don't count on it being all smooth sailing for the team, though, with Jessica ending the trailer with one of her signature barbs, this time aimed at \"Iron Clad.\"\n\nRosario Dawson, Jessica Henwick, Simone Missick, Elodie Yung, Scott Glenn, Rachael Taylor, Deborah Ann Woll, Carrie-Anne Moss, Elden Henson, and Eka Darville are also set to appear in The Defenders, which will premiere all of its eight episodes on Friday.

Iron Fist) caught up with TheWrap ahead of the release of Netflix's latest foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \"The Defenders,\" to talk about being part of two of TV's hottest shows.\n\nJones is probably best known for his role as Loras Tyrell, brother to Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer), on HBO's \"Game of Thrones.\" But since Loras and his sister (spoiler!) died at the end of Season 6, Jones has been keeping himself plenty busy as a young New York superhero.\n\nJones opened up about how his \"Defenders\" character, Danny, will fit in with more seasoned heroes Daredevil a.k.a. Matt Murdoch (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) and Luke Cage (Mike Colter). \"It's like he's just met a bunch of older brothers and sisters for the first time,\" Jones said of the relationship with the other heroes.\n\nAlso Read: 'The Defenders' Director on Being a Woman in a Man-Heavy Genre: 'I Don't Know Any Other Way'\n\n\"This is one of the first times that he's run into people that also have abilities. And these people seem to be jaded as well, but have kind of got their s -- together a little bit more than Danny,\" the actor went on to say. \"They're a little bit older and a little bit wiser. And I think Danny is kind of inspired by that, it's like he's found brothers and sisters. And I think that's deeply what Danny has always needed throughout his life, ever since he lost his parents he needs ... that friendship.\"\n\nWe'll also see Danny grow up in \"The Defenders,\" completing the character arc set into motion in Season 1 of \"Iron Fist.\"\n\n\"Definitely in 'The Defenders' we're seeing Danny becoming more self-aware, knowing how to deal with his emotions, deal with his responsibility a lot better, and in the process, yes, that means him kind of growing up,\" Jones said. But that doesn't mean Danny will lose his characteristic optimism. \"One of the great things about the hero is he really has got this very pure optimism, but I think his level of naivety is certainly going to become more grounded.\"\n\nAnd that growing up is helped along by the brother/sister figures of Matt, Jessica and Luke. \"We all know what older brothers and sisters do, they kick you in the balls and they tease you, but ultimately it's to help you grow into a better adult,\" he said. \"And I think that's what Danny is experiencing in the Defenders.\"\n\nDanny's optimism certainly shows when the four street-level heroes meet for the first time. \"He needs help,\" Jones explained, saying that Danny is less hesitant than the others to join forces (though you will see Danny have some clashing of personalities, at least at the beginning). \"He's been trying to track down members of the hand for a while now and he keeps not making any progress ... I think on an emotional level and a much deeper level, he's longed for friendship, longed for allies, and he's longed for a connection to people that understand him.\"\n\nAs for his relationship with friend/sidekick/martial arts badass Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick), Jones said it's strained at the beginning of \"The Defenders.\"\n\n\"Definitely tensions are starting to fray with them. Just because Danny -- he can be very hot-headed, buried in his own head at times because he has so much on his plate and he doesn't really know how to handle it.\" By the end of Season 1 of \"The Defenders,\" however, \"Danny is kind of in more of a position to give more to the relationship, to be more present in the relationship. And I think that will help steady them going in to Season 2.\"\n\nJones is confident in Danny's superpowers, too -- so much so that he believes the superhero would beat his flowery counterpart from Westeros.\n\n\"Loras is always a showman, he was a jouster, a knight of the summer, as it was explained in the book,\" Jones said. \"He never knew what it felt like to be on the battlefield, to be actually in sort of fight or flight combat. Whereas Danny has got more experience hand to hand. And, he also has the Iron Fist. So that kind of trumps Loras just from the get-go. But if Danny didn't have the Iron Fist I still think [he] would take Loras down in hand to hand combat.\"\n\nThe first season of \"The Defenders\" premieres Aug. 18 on Netflix.", "date": "2017-08-17",

I think so. Are we gonna see it? You'll have to tune in!\"\n\nIntriguing. The Defenders will pick up with Danny and Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) five months after the events of Iron Fist, with the pair returning to New York just as a cataclysm strikes the city.\n\n\u00a9 Sarah Shatz/Netflix\n\nJones said that sharing the \"schedule and physical workload\" with three co-leads - Charlie Cox (Matt Murdock/Daredevil), Krysten Ritter (Jessica Jones) and Mike Colter (Luke Cage) - \"allowed the show to breathe\".\n\n\"It was definitely good to share the load,\" he said. \"It allowed you to think about the scenes a little bit more clearly, take more time to rehearse the fight choreography... it just let the thing breathe a little bit, which was nice.\"\n\nThe Defenders will launch all eight episodes exclusively on Netflix this Friday (August 18).\n\nRelated ArticleDefenders launches Phase 2 of Marvel's Netflix universe\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

Colter tells Moviefone that bringing all Luke's romantic interests together gives audiences another layer of character interaction.\n\n\"Needless to say, the history is there, but I think for the audience, it adds a different color to it, adds a new level to the interaction between everyone. Every time they see Misty talking to Claire, they're thinking about that. There's that added thing. Every time they see Misty come into contact with Jessica Jones for the first time, it's like, 'Oh, what's going to happen here?' Or Jessica coming into contact with Claire,\" Colter said.\n\nHowever, if fans are hoping to see a catfight over Luke in The Defenders they might just find themselves disappointed. According to Colter, the dynamic is more about being interesting than being dramatic.\n\n\"All this underneath it all, the audience is sort of intrigued to see and to wonder, 'is there something there? Is there something that's going to come up?' Just makes it more interesting. But I don't think we're going to stoop to like, girls have to fight about Luke openly, because ultimately, they're all adults. They make decisions and things happen. That's just kind of how it is.\"\n\nYou can find out for yourself how Luke and his exes work things out when The Defenders premieres on Netflix August 18.\n\nMarvel's The Defenders follows Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones). A quartet of singular heroes with one common goal - to save New York City. This is the story of four solitary figures, burdened with their own personal challenges, who realize they just might be stronger when teamed together.\n\nThe DefendersSunday at on Netflix ComicBook Composite 89.47 NAAll-Time Comic TV Shows Average rating Star Star Star Star Star 4.47/5 from 19 usersNAAll-Time Rated Full Profile\n\nby Nicole Drum | August 17, 2017", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "wgt": 100, "id": 69, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 541, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "wgt": 100, "id": 596, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys", "wgt": 100, "id": 1058, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moviefone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "522391", "label": {"eng": "Moviefone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "547406", "label": {"eng": "Misty Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1288996", "label": {"eng": "Claire Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

After all, why cast a powerhouse like Dawson if not to spin out her dazzling turn as the wry, tough, and empathetic Temple across Netflix's Marvel empire? In the first season of Defenders, which premieres Friday on Netflix, she's due to cash in on five seasons' worth of character work and do just that.\n\nTemple kept popping up in the Defenders' solo shows -- Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist -- and with each appearance, her purpose evolved. In the first season of Daredevil, Temple's path was clear: help Murdoch, who makes everything twice as hard for himself, emotionally and physically. That she happened to fall for him and his pouty mouth felt like a romance that rose from the actors' natural chemistry (though it does have comics precedence).\n\nAfter meeting Murdoch, Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter), and Danny Rand (Finn Jones), Temple had bigger things to do than be the love interest who waits, or the plot device that keeps our not-so-street smart heroes moving out in the field.\n\nBy the time Iron Fist debuted in this past spring, Temple was in the midst of transformation -- and thank god she didn't have any attractive leading men around to distract her, because she'll begin her most important turn yet in the story of this fractious non-team of superheroes. A superhuman without superpowers, Temple has the hardest job of all: She must unite the four Defenders, despite their own self-interests, egos, and caustic personalities, which threaten to tear them and New York City apart in the process.\n\nThe Girlfriends of Marvel (\u2122) is a highly exclusive club featuring astonishing women -- all of whom have their careers and lives together -- and the men who can't function without their support, except when they deem them not useful to matters that are superhero-related.\n\nFor example, in Doctor Strange, the 2016 film, Rachel McAdams' rendition of Night Nurse -- the comics character on which Temple is based -- merely existed to provide the context and origin around the title character's petulant angst.\n\nAnd it took Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts four movies before writers put her on the same level as Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's characteristically pyrotechnic third acts.\n\nAnt-man's plot was centered around Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) training an under-qualified man for a job that should rightfully have been hers. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is completely out of the picture in the upcoming Thor: Ragnorak; Marvel Studios President Kevin Fiege explained earlier this year that it was because the movie spends very little time on Earth. (However, it's been rumored that Portman wasn't happy with the role and lost interest in the direction of the franchise.)\n\nRemember Betty Ross? No one's even heard from her, since she was played Liv Tyler, in Edward Norton's The Incredible Hulk, a film that came out in 2008. With the exception of Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) , who was blessed with two seasons of character development on TV with Agent Carter, the Girlfriends of Marvel (\u2122) are just that: women who match or outclass their partners in every way -- but are mostly utilized for furthering a man's own story arc.\n\nTemple undoubtedly began her journey in that club. But ya girl Claire knew her worth and broke up with the \u1f351-worthy Murdoch at the end the first season of Daredevil. She did get caught up again in Jessica Jones with Luke Cage, and that relationship blossomed in his eponymous series. And can any of us really blame her? The man is literally built to be a thirst trap:\n\nTemple and Cage are slated to uncross their stars in The Defenders, but have the world against them: the baggage of exes, both super-powered and not; the scaled operations of terrorist group The Hand; and at least one immortal soldier, all stand in their way. So with the promise of a thrilling sex scene and the mitigating circumstances already in place for a breakup with Cage, Temple's due to break the mold that's shaped so many other female leads in MCU: She can no longer be a Girlfriend of Marvel (\u2122).\n\nOne need to look no further than the comments made by the overarching Marvel Netflix villain, Madame Gao (Wai Ching Ho), in Iron Fist, about Temple's obvious yearning to transform herself:\n\n\"You often find yourself fraternizing with people with gifts, you secretly hope that the thing that makes them special will rub off on you.\"\n\nWhile Gao meant this as a dig -- Temple was a mere mortal human standing in the midst of a super-powered fight -- unifying the Defenders is Temple's true mission. In Iron Fist, she not only shed herself of distracting romantic entanglements, but also began honing skills that would help her join the fight: She trained with Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick), found ways to adapt her nursing skills to the field, and traveled abroad on various team missions. Temple's biggest contribution to the team -- her first-hand knowledge about The Hand notwithstanding -- was clearing a path for Jessica and Danny to talk about their emotions honestly.\n\nThe infamous, and frankly adorable (regardless how one feels about the pairing) take-out scene is the point in the series where Danny and Jessica first acknowledge the compartmentalized romantic dimension of their growing allyship. This spurs a greater collaboration among the entire team. By bringing together people who can help each other, while helping the denizens of New York, Temple defined her role in upcoming Defenders. Like her Avengers counterpart, Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), Temple's journey is motivated wanting to help the millions of people in New York, not by a lover who has been \"fridged\" (written off the show via death or other means to further the hero's emotional arc).\n\nJudging from The Defenders trailer, a for-real break-up with Luke seems imminent (\"How does being Harlem's Hero allow you to live an actual life?\"), which means it's finally Temple's time to shine. The true center of Netflix's The Defenders, Temple's not merely the connective tissue between our four vigilantes, but the person who reminds them for who and why they fight. After all, two out of four characters -- Jones and Rand -- are motivated by tragic origin stories, and started their journeys out of personal revenge. The other two -- Cage and Murdoch -- haven't proven themselves capable of directing their emotion and abilities productively. Temple is the only woman for the most difficult job in the Defenders: reminding a bunch of destructive assholes they call this beautiful cesspool of city home, just like the millions they've been tasked to save.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Fraternal", "wgt": 100, "id": 498, "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Fraternal"}, {"uri":

But they shouldn't worry as they won't have to wait long.\n\nJessica Jones and Luke Cage are already filming their second seasons for release in 2018, and now we know when the Devil of Hell's Kitchen will begin his return to the streaming platform. A new report from MCU Exchange indicates production is set to begin on Daredevil Season Three this October.\n\nNo word yet on which cast members will be back or any new additions to the fold, but we should expect familiar faces like Deborah Ann Woll, Elden Henson, and of course Charlie Cox.\n\nDaredevil's third season will pick up after the events of The Defenders and Matt Murdock's confrontation with the resurrected Elektra. The actors involved in the series have all stated that their characters will be drastically changed by the events of the crossover, so we expect Daredevil to continue following the same threads.\n\nAll of Matt Murdock's adventures thus far have seen him dealing with the corruption in Hell's Kitchen, especially against the Hand. With The Defenders serving as a sort of climax in the Hand's attempts to control and/or destroy New York City, it will be interesting to see what follows.\n\nWill we see the return of Wilson Fisk AKA the Kingpin? Or a brand new villain that we've yet to see on the series? Maybe a mixture of both?\n\nHopefully we learn more about the third season of Daredevil as we get closer to its production start later this year. Given the increase in output of Marvel's Netflix series, maybe we can expect to see four shows per year, which would put Daredevil's release a little over a year from now.\n\nThe Defenders hits Netflix on Friday, August 18th.\n\nThe DefendersSunday at on Netflix ComicBook Composite 89.47 NAAll-Time Comic TV Shows Average rating Star Star Star Star Star 4.47/5 from 19 usersNAAll-Time Rated Full Profile The Defenders Photos Gallery Start Gallery Back to Article\n\nThe Defenders Photos Gallery\n\nImage -\n\nby Joseph Schmidt | August 16, 2017", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 100, "id": 7, "label": "dmoz/Arts"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 100, "id": 231, "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Kitchen,_Manhattan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217604"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingpin_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "437318", "label": {"eng": "Kingpin (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Henson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "504480", "label": {"eng": "Elden Henson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "641252", "label": {"eng": "Elektra (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Ann_Woll", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "661053", "label": {"eng": "Deborah Ann Woll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}]}

Even though we needed to interview with the showrunner of each show, we pretty much, it was just all logistics things. We pretty much were told that it was going to be a nice, three year adventure!\n\nWow! And what was that experience like for you?\n\nIt's great. I mean, I've never had this before, I've obviously never worked with Marvel before, so coming to a project -- projects -- knowing that it's going to be three years, is like a good thing, knowing you have stability. It's also kind of an adjustment period to know, okay, this is going to be my life. I'm not going to have any breaks for three years! [laughs] I started meditating! I did, really!\n\nI can imagine it must be very pressurized environment to shoot an effects-heavy show in New York, on a TV schedule.\n\nIt is, and I think especially superhero shows, especially these [kind of] superheroes, many of them work at night. Which means night shoots. So I have night shoots, to be part of it on set, but part of the design process is me being, me getting up after a night shoot before I actually go to set, a few hours before.\n\nRelated: Defenders review: Finding the 'why' in team\n\nAnd you know, I have to check emails, and there's so many discussions and prep for the day, for the future episode, even for the future show. Just because Marvel really likes to be prepared, so they plan everything in advance, and that means that there's so many makeup tests and multiple discussions... I mean, it's a great thing, I think, because there's so much prep [that] goes into everything.\n\nYou can't even imagine, like the littlest thing, like the color of the blood for Daredevil. Just because, you know, the lighting, and the filters, and the camera you're using. So everything is prepped as far in advance as possible, so that when we actually get onto the day, it's just going to be executed as seamlessly as possible.\n\nWhat would you say was the most challenging show to work on?\n\nI mean, it has to do with the actual show, and the character too. I mean, the biggest one, obviously, was the Defenders because you have the superheroes themselves, and you have the stunts. And then you have the villains and you have their stunts. So whatever I'm doing to the superheroes, I have to do to the stunts and match them, so it's double the amount of special effects.\n\nI was in charge of the non-prosthetic special effects and Josh Turi who's my prosthetic designer... he was in charge of the Iron Fist tattoo. Because there was so much involved in that, there was like 25 tests, and I have so much going on on my end in multiple facets -- you know, schedule, designing, doing wound maps, hiring people, man-power for the team. There's just a lot going on all the time. So I decided that it's best for him to handle that, so that he could be, you know, fully attentive to that.\n\nSo he does the prosthetic things, and I do all the non-prosthetic things. Madam Gao, for instance! She's a non-prosthetic aging character. She sits in the chair every time for about an hour and a half, two people, we age -- every skin particle that you see on camera is all aged.\n\nReally!\n\nOh yeah! It's like, latex. There's two people, it's called stretch-and-stipple. One person, my assistant will stretch the skin, and I'll stipple the old age latex. And after the drying process and everything, we'll do multiple layers and we hand-paint age spots and different marks on her. So it's her hands, her arms, her neck, her face -- everything.\n\nWow. That's amazing.\n\nYeah. So that, for instance, people sometimes think that's just prosthetics. No, no, it's not prosthetics!\n\nEach of the Defenders series are pretty violent shows. What would percentage of your work is doing \"mess-up\" on the characters, as opposed to makeup?\n\nI love that question. I would say it could be, let's say sixty-forty. But I think that my specific job as head of makeup and designer, that also entails not only doing makeup. Because of, like what I was saying before, the prep and the designing, and you know, we have character sheets and wound maps -- especially for Daredevil, to see the continuity and the [evolution] of everything that he gets. Especially knowing, you know, he has healing powers.\n\nSo there's meetings about that too, of course! [laughs] Every episode we come in, we're like, okay, so how many days have passed? Would Matt Murdock have a bruise that's more yellow and green, because he has healing powers and it's been three days? Or would it still be purple? I mean, the details that you wouldn't imagine. It's amazing.\n\nDo you have a distinctive makeup feature for each of the Defenders?\n\nYes! For me just in general, I think the design process of all these shows is to do makeup that is more invisible. So even though there will be some makeup on, what I mean by invisible [is] that you won't really notice it as part of the character, and it to me just enhances the storyline rather than having someone say, \"Ooh, what is this weird lipstick that Jessica Jones is wearing?\"\n\nI mean, Jessica Jones, she doesn't give a fuck what she looks like. She'll wake up in the morning, if she's even sleeping, she'll get out of the house and she doesn't look in the mirror. So to make her a little edgy, [Krysten Ritter] has such nice, pigmented lips, so all we did is put cherry chapstick just to enhance that color, [and] just smudge a little bit of eyeliner. I mean, don't get me wrong, she has makeup, she has a full face on. But you won't really see that on camera. It kind of looks like she's all messy and edgy... but that was pretty much distinctive for her.\n\nI feel in general for the guys, less is more. Like I was saying before about just creating a character, it's called character makeup. I don't want too much makeup on the guys -- I don't want anybody to say, \"Ooh, his face doesn't match his neck,\" or, ahh! I want people, and mainly these shows are for the fans. I want them to get into the story and just to continue relating to these characters and their issues, especially on the personal shows.\n\nSo that's pretty much for me, I mean, distinctive, I mean, we had to figure out Danny Rand's beard --\n\nYep, he had the homeless beard for the first two episodes. And then coming into [episode] three, it was also a discussion that involved Finn Jones himself -- what length of beard makes him comfortable to portray his character accurately? So that was a discussion that involved him, I gave my two cents, then Marvel/Netflix had to approve, [and] the showrunner. A lot of chefs! But it just makes things go smoothly on the day, like I said.\n\nWith so much going on in these four series, what role do you have in preserving the continuity between series?\n\nA huge, huge role! Oh my God, [I knew] that I was coming into a three year ride, so at the end of each show I collected notes about wounds, about facial hair length, what tools I used, what products I used. I took pictures of actor bags not even knowing who's going to be in the Defenders! You know, I only knew who was going to be in the Defenders pretty much after I got hired to do the Defenders, and not even then -- when they were doing scripts, then we kind of got the breakdown and went \"Oh, this one from this is going to be [in the show.]\" So what I did to help me, I had to be very organized because I technically have about a week off in between each show --\n\nBut [I just need] to be really organized, because I knew I'm going to need to hit the ground running, because it's so many characters in the Defenders. So at the end of each show, I compiled notes into a folder that just grew, and grew, and grew. By the time I got to Defenders, I took pictures of the actor bags and the products, knowing what I'm going to be using because of consistency of the characters. Even though, you know, some involved like, Daredevil's scars and wounds, but you know, basically facial hair and the tools that was used.\n\nAnd the other thing is, I tried to keep, let's say from Luke Cage and Iron Fist to Defenders, I tried to keep the same team. Just because I knew that Defenders is going to be everybody, and I wanted, because of the maybe chaos I'm going to get into, I want the [makeup] trailer to be as fun as possible. Knowing the challenges, we have night shoots, we have tandem units, it's just going to be a lot going on. So my team continued with me from Iron Fist to Defenders, so that everybody knows everybody, so they don't need to like re-learn [the process], you know? So that was a huge benefit. I'm nothing without my team, so it's great.\n\nDo you have a memorable makeup moment from your work on the Defenders or the original series?\n\nYes, I totally do! Iron Fist, after we groomed his beard, I told the producer, \"Just so you know, once I groom his beard, it's going to be really hard to re-shoot anything from the first two episodes, where he has a real big, huge, bushy beard.\" He said, \"Oh no, that's gonna be fine.\"\n\nCut to a month and a half later, I get an email, \"So, what do you think of the fact that we need-\" I kid you not, this is exactly how it was... \"Is it possible that we need to re-shoot four scenes from episodes one and two while Finn has his short beard?\" So I was like, \"WHAT??\" And of course, this has to happen, so what we needed to do, I needed to -- I mean, [the producer] gave me like a week, ten days to prepare, thank God!\n\nSo I needed to get a full, bushy beard [and] we had to color it, we had to curl it, texturize it. We had to do two makeup tests to put it on top of his existing beard, which I have not done before because that's a big challenge. You know, if you put facial hair on top of skin, it's different than putting facial hair on top of facial hair and to mask the [wig] lace.\n\nSo it took us a bit to get to the right amount of glue, and how to mask everything to make it so delicate, and to match it. And we did it! And you won't even see, there's a couple of scenes where [Danny] doesn't even have his real, bushy beard on. It's fake.\n\nWow!\n\nBut that was a huge challenge I never, ever thought I'd have to do. A full beard on top of a full beard, oh my God. Thank God nobody noticed!... that was a moment I'll never forget.\n\nWhat do you view as your contribution to the rich world of Marvel and Netflix?\n\nWell, I'm really proud to establish these first shows, and to create, actually, some characters that weren't even in the Marvel comics. Like Madam Gao, like I was saying. And also, this whole thing is just homage for the fans. So everything we're doing is for the fans. So for instance, I'm so excited when I see a piece of art that someone does of Jessica Jones, and [it] has her cuts from the beginning of Jessica Jones. There's two cuts that she has near her brow and near her cheek on the left side. I see that in all the fan art and people do cosplay and stuff like that at comic cons, and I see those cuts. So all these things that we created that are now going to live forever, that's part of my creative input that Marvel and Netflix loved and approved.\n\nSo to me it's like, Marvel is such a huge universe. It's a shared universe, so to me it's just, I mean, I'm grateful to have this opportunity. And I mean, obviously it's all based on the comic books, but we are creating our own stories and the backstory of each one, especially on the individual shows. So just to create those characters and have them live forever.\n\nAnother thing that I think [I'm] taking from the Defenders is that it was the biggest show I've ever done, and I kind of feel like I could do anything after this, because I'm now more prepared for huge shows. I mean, we've had days where we had about 30 cast and stunt members, and we had to match skin tones... put beards on in 15 minutes. We had to do bruises and blood and dirt, all on the fly. And the changes that happen daily, every day is not like the other.\n\nAnd sometimes you'd come to the day thinking it's going to be a certain way, and then weather dependent, actor availability, scene change, someone maybe gets hurt, which has happened. For instance, on Defenders, Krysten [Ritter] punched a stunt guy and her hand got all bruised. Things like that, so I suddenly have to cover it... There's unimaginable things that happen, and it makes it challenging but exciting, and I feel like I'm really prepared for anything knowing that this was that kind of a schedule.\n\nFinally, I'm going to make you chose between your babies! Which is your favorite series and hero?\n\nOh no! Um... I'm really connected to Jessica Jones, I think, for a few reasons. I mean, all the other shows... okay, this is a very female driven show, obviously. We're very close, Krysten Ritter and I, we're actually shooting Jessica Jones season 2 right now. So it's our third show together... and I just relate to many stories there, and we have all female directors on season 2, so it's really exciting just to see the storylines develop and to get other character's storylines developed... so as much as I love all the boys, I love the girls more, I guess!

Outside of a rudimentary knowledge of each character's unique abilities, I'd only recommend a passing familiarity with Daredevil Season 2, as relates to The Hand as an evil organization.\n\nIt only takes the bulk of two episodes to start weaving Jessica, Matt, Luke and Danny into one another's lives, as their seemingly distinct paths begin to converge. The banter between Jones and Murdoch, sampled above, is truly an ongoing highlight, evolving from slightly adversarial to a degree of awe. Luke and Danny's own \"meet cute\" has been well-spoiled by the very first trailers, though it does deliver a visually exciting examination of the unstoppable force paradox.\n\nEach series' supporting characters also get their due, especially as Claire Temple (Rosaria Dawson) and Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick) attempt to broker a detente between Luke and Danny, while Daredevil's Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) and Jessica's neighbor-turned-assistant Malcolm Ducasse (Eka Darville) also find their way into the four episodes made available to critics. Scott Glenn's Stick plays a sizeable role, especially as an exposition-dumping peacemaker of sorts for the barely-formed, squabbling superhero quartet.\n\nNew to the scene is Alexandra, an enigmatic and elegant adversary brought to life by filmdom's Sigourney Weaver. Whether absorbing a private performance of classical music, holding a familiar face at katana-point or deflecting the blows of the masterful (and resurrected!) Electra (Elodie Yung), Weaver brings a cool and collected vibe to the role, not even flinching when one of the heroes seems to have gotten the drop on her organization.\n\nFight scenes are economically parsed out across the first couple of episodes, mainly serving to educate/remind us of the special something each hero brings to the table. Not able to achieve the (expensive) scope of, say, an all-out, multi-pronged Avengers melee, the group fights aren't nearly as grand but enjoyable in their own right. (And for those who queued up Iron Fist, know that Jones has gotten better at selling his punches/kicks and doesn't seem to be doubled quite as frequently.)\n\nBut again, just as when the Avengers first assembled, much of the joy here is seeing disparate personalities get to know each other (the Immortal Iron Fist's dragon-costarring origin story prompts Jessica to ask if he's \"on lithium\") and reluctantly embrace the T-word -- team. (As Luke puts it, \"I'm not looking for superfriends,\" surely to the delight of Marvel's lawyers.) Matt has his reasons for not wanting to fight this grand fight, as does lone wolf Jessica, while impervious Luke is more inclined to take a bullet (...or 100) in the name of a greater good that just might happen to save one young life.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "385315", "label": {"eng": "Katana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "465006", "label": {"eng": "Scott Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Henson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "504480", "label": {"eng": "Elden Henson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eka_Darville", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "504482", "label": {"eng": "Eka Darville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Wing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "555508", "label": {"eng": "Colleen Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foggy_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "641254", "label": {"eng": "Foggy Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "714041", "label": {"eng": "Features of the Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Henwick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "749745", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Henwick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1288996", "label": {"eng": "Claire Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}]}

It's the culmination of four TV shows, and it will be interesting to see if it all comes together.

Weaver's a great actress and she seems to be having fun playing the heavy, but it's weird to put the villain front and center when the big hook of your show is that your bringing four superheroes together.

While Captain Marvel and Ant-Man & the Wasp will be the first MCU films headlined by female superheroes, Black Widow has been a key player in the MCU since Iron Man 2. Meanwhile, the TV side of the MCU boasts a number of powerful women. One of the most intriguing, however, is Elektra. Introduced last year in Daredevil season 2, her death will push her in a bloody new direction when The Defenders premieres.\n\nPart of that shift will will provide Elodie Yung with a whole new character to explore in The Defenders. It will also further devastate Matt Murdoch, who won't be starting the show off in the best of circumstances. Given Elektra's ties to The Hand and the villainous Alexandra, The Defenders will diver deeper into her character and the mysterious connections that those around her share. But as fascinating as both Elektra and Black Widow are, the distance between Marvel's films and TV shows means we may never see them share the screen. Now, however, we have the next best thing.\n\nRelated: Daughters of the Dragon Meet in The Defenders Clip\n\nLauren Mary Kim, the stunt double for Elektra in The Defenders, has posted a video online, showing her battling Amy Johnston, one of Black Widow's doubles. Coordinated, edited, and filmed by Bryan Sloyer with fight choreography by Tsuyoshi Abe, the short provides a high-octane battle between two stellar martial artists. Though not fully in costume, each actor features a nod to their character. All told, it's an exciting bit of side marketing for The Defenders and a great way to highlight Marvel's female fighters.\n\nSo...here is my ANSWER to who would win if #ELEKTRA fought #BLACKWIDOW in Entry #3 of my KALI DIARIES series. Huge thanks to the ridic talented @amyejohnston who was one of Black Widow's stunt doubles, @sloyerstunts - Fight coordinating, Camera and Editing and Tsuyoshi Abe -Fight Choreography. Go #Marvel And check out #Defenders on August 18 on #Netflix #thewomenofmarvel #stuntdouble #stunts #v10stunts\n\nA post shared by Lauren Mary Kim (@laurenmarykim) on Aug 9, 2017 at 11:32am PDT\n\n-\n\nWhile Elektra and Black Widow usually fight on the same side, their independent streaks and complicated histories mean they've certainly come to blows before in the world of Marvel Comics. The most recent altercation came from Marjorie Liu's excellent run on Black Widow, which provided further insight into the lives of both women.\n\nWhile Elektra won't be fighting Black Widow in the MCU anytime soon, the ninja will come face-to-face with a few other female warriors. Jessica Jones will certainly be going up against Elektra, and we may even see Misty Knight and Colleen Wing fight the resurrected warrior.\n\nWe don't know yet how the events of The Defenders will shape Elektra's future, but hopefully the nuanced character will have a long future in the MCU. And if Scarlett Johansson ever feels like cameoing on a Netflix show, fans may just get the Elektra and Black Widow fight they've been waiting to see.\n\nNEXT: The Defenders Gets a Final Trailer\n\nThe Defenders premieres August 18 on Netflix, with The Punisher arriving this fall. Premiere dates for the new seasons of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist have not yet been announced.\n\nSource: Lauren Mary Kim\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

In case you're not hyped enough, however, Netflix has released one final trailer to whet your appetite.\n\nThis trailer is mostly about Sigourney Weaver lecturing heroes Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist on why their attempt to band together to oppose her are misguided. She gives some hints about her nefarious plans, and then there's some punching and other hitting.\n\nIt sounds simple, and it really doesn't give us much more than we already knew about the premise of the series. But it does feel surprisingly epic for a TV show, which has me excited to check out the real thing once it's available to stream in its entirety. So, mission accomplished for a trailer, then.\n\nWe'll definitely be talking about The Defenders on the next episode of Original Content, our new podcast focused on original streaming programming, so get hyped for that, too.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 577, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "wgt": 100, "id": 636, "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trucking", "wgt": 100, "id": 696, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Trucking"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "wgt": 100, "id": 922, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 1010, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303532", "label": {"eng": "Television program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349310", "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}]}

Rosario Dawson. Jessica Henwick. Rachael Taylor. Debra Ann Woll. Simone Missick. Sigourney freaking Weaver. These are the women of Marvel and Netflix's The Defenders, and living proof that Marvel might finally be listening to its female fans. Yes, Tessa Thompson kicking ass in the Thor: Ragnarok trailer is promising. Of course female Marvel fans are champing at the bit for Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. And hell yes, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2's secondary plot about the bonds of sisterhood was a fantastic amuse-bouche. But the women on Netflix's latest miniseries are walking the walk and the talking the talk -- right now.\n\n\"I think what's shifted somewhat is that the female audience is now standing up and saying I want to be heard,\" says head of Marvel TV, Jeph Loeb, when we speak at San Diego Comic-Con. \"There was always belief in that audience. And so, I think more and more the people who might look at comics as a boy's club should really understand it's not a boy's club, it's not a girl's club, it's a human club.\"\n\nSure, it's a \"human\" club -- but it's one that could use more than a few more complex, kickass women in its ranks, on both the big and small screens.\n\nAnd to be fair, Marvel TV is already leaps and bounds ahead of the film scape, having delivered Jessica Jones, a series about Ritter's acerbic, fierce, and utterly fantastic female superhero and a woman who quickly became the face of feminism in the fandom. But now, The Defenders is bringing together the beloved Ms. Jones alongside fantastic supporting characters like Missick's badass detective Misty Night (first seen in Luke Cage), Colleen Wing (widely regarded as the only good thing about Iron Fist), and Dawson's Claire Temple to help the titular Defenders face off against The Hand. On the more evil side of the coin sit Young, returning as Elektra (via means you'll have to watch the series to understand), and the woman, the myth, the legend, Sigourney Weaver, pulling the strings that eventually force the Defenders to band together.\n\nThough The Defenders is, at times, a bit difficult to follow because it has so many damn characters, the sheer breadth of female characters is still extremely exciting (and so is one scene in which Weaver drops her decorum to throw a few kicks and punches herself). And it would seem that the actors working on the series tend to agree.\n\n\"I worked with [Krysten] on Vamps and Elodie, I worked with almost every day [on The Defenders],\" says Weaver. \"I think they're both such amazing actors and people, and I really applaud Marvel for having so many strong women characters in their universe, and particularly, I think, in these shows.\"\n\nFor Young, getting to work on a series with characters like Jessica Jones is basically a dream come true.\n\n\"It's [Jessica's] attitude -- it's almost French,\" she says with a laugh. \"It's like, 'I'm not happy to be here and I'm not going to hide it I'm just going to say it.' So I like that about her character, and she's got her own agenda. I like this side of a woman.\"\n\nAnd while this series and its deep bench of kickass ladies (both good and evil) is a something to be admired, women who love Marvel are no doubt hoping that this group is only the beginning.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People", "wgt": 100, "id": 115, "label": "dmoz/Society/People"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women_in_Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 1082, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women in Music"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304941", "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305892", "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311303", "label": {"eng": "Thor (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314207", "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349310", "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "352071", "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brie_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "353935", "label": {"eng": "Brie Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krysten_Ritter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "364912", "label": {"eng": "Krysten Ritter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessa_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "366911", "label": {"eng": "Tessa Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amuse-bouche", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "386875", "label": {"eng": "Amuse-bouche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachael_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "394467", "label": {"eng": "Rachael Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeph_Loeb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "408147", "label": {"eng": "Jeph Loeb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "409370", "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Wing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "555508", "label": {"eng": "Colleen Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(1961_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "676736", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (1961 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Henwick", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "749745", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Henwick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vamps_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1191107", "label": {"eng": "Vamps (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_Vol._2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1273372", "label": {"eng": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1288996", "label": {"eng": "Claire Temple"}}]}

While Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and the Iron Fist all live in the same New York City, they all come from very different shows.\n\n\"In the story we took our time, each person introducing the audience to their own worlds,\" showrunner Marco Ramirez told IndieWire. \"We made sure that we really honor the fact that they all existed independently before they start coming together.\"\n\nThat's why it was important to find the right director, someone capable of capturing not just the unique natures of each character, but their basic aesthetics. And the director tasked with making that work on screen -- essentially, directing four different styles of show at the same time -- was S.J. Clarkson, a television veteran from the U.K. with credits including \"Life on Mars,\" \"Whitechapel,\" and \"Orange is the New Black.\"\n\n\"That was probably the biggest challenge that I thought of, when they asked me to do it,\" Clarkson said. \"I was like, 'OK, so what is it going to look like?'\"\n\nAs the director of \"Marvel's Jessica Jones\" Episodes 1 and 2, Clarkson was a key architect of that show's tone and look, but she had three other series to deal with. Her solution was to \"honor the looks of the shows\" by heightening the individual color palettes of each character.\n\n\"Matt Murdoch's world had hints of red everywhere,\" Ramirez added. \"Jessica Jones' world had lots of violet and lots of purple and lots of blue, Luke Cage had a lot of ambers and yellows, Iron Fist had a lot of green and earth tones. And so when [the characters] finally start to combine and cross pollinate visually, [Clarkson] then told the story of green and yellow meeting, or red and purple meeting, or red and blue meeting. And so that, I think, that to me was the stroke of genius that made the first two episodes shootable.\"\n\nMike Colter, who first worked with Clarkson in his initial debut as Luke Cage in \"Jessica Jones,\" said that \"she's been working with this brand for a while now, so she has a real feel for what it takes to tell the story and how to make it that extra flair that comic book stories tend to have. She knows the camera angles, the lighting.\"\n\nFor Clarkson, the hardest show to invoke was \"Iron Fist.\" As someone who didn't grow up as a huge comic book fan, the director said she responded more to the more grounded story of a character like Jessica Jones.\n\n\"I think I can safely say that, of the four of them, 'Iron Fist' is the more mythological, out-there one,\" she said. \"I suppose that one I found really challenging to get into, but once again, I just went with character, because I thought you could think about it as being this martial artist from K'un-Lun, and this whole sort of mythological, magical world out there, or I can just go, 'What's it about?'\"\n\nBut once she got into the character of Danny Rand (Finn Jones), it became a lot easier to engage with \"Iron Fist.\"\n\n\"This is about a guy who is really hurting, because he's lost his family and he's trying to figure out who he is,\" she said. \"He's trying to fit back into the world, and he has this ability that he knows is this massive responsibility that he's actually struggling to deal with. Once I went in on that, and once I thought that's what he's about, then I could land it.\"\n\nIt may have helped that she had a bit of a head start -- while she was in pre-production on \"Defenders,\" the first season of \"Iron Fist\" was in production, and she was asked to reshoot a scene that the original director of the episode wasn't available to handle.\n\n\"I got to work with Finn in advance, which was great for me,'\" she said. \"Then, when it came to working with him again, we already had a shorthand, because we'd had that time together. I actually think that reshoot was incredibly valuable for me, if anything, because I just sort of actually got down and sort of started to immerse myself in that world.\"\n\nEven while setting up each of the Defenders as distinct characters, Clarkson did build a visual language that would eventually unify them. \"Each of them had their own voice, but they were all shot in the same lenses. I had a similar feel to each of the framing of them, so that you felt like you were in the same world,\" she said.\n\n\"The other thing I tried to really concentrate on was transitions, so the transition between cutting from one character to the next and moving from one place to the other. I established this look of trains passing, so it was almost like if you traveled across town or uptown, you would then meet the next character,\" Clarkson said.\n\nThose transitions often became as detailed as ending a scene with one character turning to look behind him, and then cutting to another character (shot a completely different day). Clarkson described one moment: \"[Luke Cage] puts his hood up and he descends the stairs, and then Jessica's ascending the stairs and she puts her hood down. It's like it's almost that they're the same person or they're almost looking at each other or mirroring each other. When you have those ideas in mind, you've got to be quite specific about what you get.\"\n\nThat specificity, among other qualities, earned her a great deal of respect from the cast.\n\n\"She's fabulous, man,\" said Charlie Cox, who plays Matt Murdoch/Daredevil. \"She's very cool. And this is something that I really admire in directors, something I really like, is that she's very opinionated. She's not afraid to tell you what she wants and what she thinks, and she's very, very organized, very prepared. She has a vision, and she wants to see it through.\"\n\nFinn Jones called Clarkson one his favorite directors.\n\n\"She takes no shit from anyone,\" he said. \"And she really cares about getting the best out of her actors and doesn't compromise until she gets that performance. For an actor, that's really great, especially when there's lots of demands from producers and scheduling, and she'll just be like, 'No, hold on guys. I'm the boss here. We're going to make sure we get the best of these actors and this scene before we move on.' To have someone like that as a director for the first two episodes is a complete blessing.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 100, "id": 713, "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305280", "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307118", "label": {"eng": "Avengers (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311156", "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "311297", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315526", "label": {"eng": "Orange Is the New Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351773", "label": {"eng": "Indiewire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "386870", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "474960", "label": {"eng": "Life on Mars (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Colter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "555507", "label": {"eng": "Mike Colter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Cox", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "574287", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Cox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "650834", "label": {"eng": "Finn Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "671389", "label": {"eng": "Venom (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "714041", "label": {"eng": "Features of the Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1295284", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defenders_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1304371", "label": {"eng": "The Defenders (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._J._Clarkson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1440520", "label": {"eng": "S.

The show unites Hell's Kitchen anti-heroes Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Daredevil, and the recently inducted Iron Fist around a common enemy: Alexandra, a sophisticated, all-powerful villain played by Sigourney Weaver. But only a few weeks out from the premiere, little is known about their enigmatic foe, leaving viewers in the dark about who Alexandra from The Defenders is and what exactly she's capable of.\n\nBoth cast and crew have been careful not to let many specifics slip, but they have shared at least a few details, albeit vague ones. When showrunner Marco Ramirez unveiled a first look at the character in Entertainment Weekly back in May, he described her as \"intellectual,\" \"dangerous,\" and an \"utter badass.\" Then, when the outlet caught up with him and Weaver again last month, they offered a somewhat clearer picture, with Ramirez calling her \"a survivor\" more interested in protecting, not destroying, the world -- or at least her vision of it. He continued:\n\nWeaver, meanwhile, framed Alexandra as more of an adversary than a true villain, explaining that she's much more than a shallow plot point forcing the Defenders together, and that her conflict with them isn't as diabolical as it is a difference of opinion. \"There are things she cares about deeply, but she probably doesn't care about the same things the Defenders care about, so that puts them on a collision course,\" Weaver told Entertainment Weekly. \"In many ways, she's an admirable person.\"\n\nElsewhere, fans have speculated that her position as the head of an ancient organization marks potential ties to The Hand, a criminal order of ninja assassins that have long loomed over the Marvel universe. It's a connection that Ramirez seems to have all but confirmed. When asked outright if Alexandra was their leader during another interview with Entertainment Weekly, Ramirez said that characters from sister shows like Daredevil and Iron Fist always hint that there are other, bigger players pulling the strings behind scenes, and that Alexandra is \"the thing in the shadows who's finally walking out.\"\n\nBut where The Hand was present in the original comics, Alexandra was not, making her exact involvement and motives difficult to piece together. Movie Pilot writer Tom Bacon theorized in March that she could be a gender-swapped version of Alexander Bont, a ruthless crime lord and the first kingpin of Hell's Kitchen. But Ramirez and co. don't seem to have addressed that possibility, so for now, it's nothing more than a hunch.\n\nWith little else to go on, Alexandra's exact identity is anyone's guess, but it won't be long until the big reveal.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100, "id": 111, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100, "id": 212, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Event_Planning_and_Production", "wgt": 100, "id": 1145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Event Planning and Production"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Textiles", "wgt": 100, "id": 1561, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Textiles"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Kitchen,_Manhattan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217604"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306565", "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308299", "label": {"eng": "Interview"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311297", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "313045", "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "354796", "label": {"eng": "Ninja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "364911", "label": {"eng": "Jessica Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "373788", "label": {"eng": "Luke Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}]}

Since we're inherently generous folks here, we've put together a handy catch-up guide to refresh your memory -- or give you a crash course.\n\nAre you sitting comfortably? Then we'll begin.\n\nThe only Marvel/Netflix series with two seasons so far, Daredevil follows Matt Murdock -- an attorney by day and vigilante by night -- who lost his sight in a childhood accident, but found his other senses heightened. Trained by a blind martial arts master named Stick, Matt has always possessed fighting prowess, but is only just starting to put his abilities to work when the show begins.\n\nSeason 1 charts Matt's attempts to clean up Hell's Kitchen and protect its inhabitants from the organized crime and chaos that has sprung up in the wake of the Chitauri invasion of New York in the first Avengers film.\n\nA corrupt businessman, Wilson Fisk -- aka the Kingpin -- hopes to consolidate his power by controlling these warring factions, bringing him into partnership with a criminal organization known as The Hand, whose leaders include the warrior Nobu and the enigmatic drug dealer Madame Gao.\n\nThe Hand seeks a powerful weapon known as the Black Sky, a living instrument of death that The Hand worships but also controls, for reasons that are never fully explained but still seem super ominous.\n\nEarly on in Season 1, Matt meets a nurse, Claire Temple, who patches up his wounds after she finds him injured in a dumpster, and she becomes his confidant (and brief love interest), since she's one of the only people who knows about his double-life. Their romance doesn't last long, since dating Daredevil is hazardous to one's health and sanity, but she continues to help Matt out when he (frequently) needs it.\n\nMatt eventually takes down the Kingpin, but The Hand proves elusive, returning with a vengeance (so. many. ninjas.) in Season 2, after it's revealed that Matt's first love, Elektra, is the Black Sky, and they want her bad. Season 2 also makes it clear that Matt and Elektra have a passionate but toxic relationship and that Elektra, always somewhat disaffected, doesn't have the same hesitations about killing that Matt (as a good, guilt-ridden Catholic boy) does.\n\nAnother twist? Elektra was also secretly trained by Stick as a child, until he ditched her and started training Matt instead, after she proved too volatile to control. Oh, and did we mention that Stick is a member of another secret organization, The Chaste, which was created to oppose The Hand with its own army of noble warriors? Stick and Elektra show up in Season 2 to try and enlist Matt into this eternal war with The Hand, but Elektra is ultimately killed by Nobu and her body is stolen by The Hand, who stash her in a creepy stone sarcophagus which is somehow intended to help resurrect her.\n\nMatt's focus on Elektra and the escalating war with The Hand has put a rift between him and his closest friends, including his law partner, Foggy Nelson, who finds out his secret identity and urges him to give up his life of crime-fighting to tackle injustice the legal way, and his former secretary-turned-newspaper reporter Karen Page, who has always had an unrequited crush on him. Oh, and Frank Castle, aka The Punisher, also shows up and wreaks mayhem, but he's getting his own standalone show, so we don't need to get into all of his nonsense right now.\n\nAt the end of Season 2, Matt reveals his secret identity to Karen, and Foggy disbands their partnership and goes to work at the fancy Manhattan law firm of Hogarth Chao & Benowitz.\n\nWhich brings us to...\n\nThe most critically-acclaimed of Netflix's Marvel shows, Jessica Jones follows the titular former superhero-turned private investigator, who is trying to put her life back together following her escape from an abusive, non-consensual relationship with a man named Kilgrave, who possesses mind-control abilities. In addition to working her own cases, Jessica also does odd jobs for Jeri Hogarth (yes, of Hogarth Chao & Benowitz), like delivering subpoenas and tracking down evidence for Jeri's lawsuits.\n\nThe mental and sexual abuse she suffered at Kilgrave's hands has left Jessica with PTSD and an unhealthy reliance on alcohol, but she's been marginally successful at moving on from her trauma (or at least repressing it) since she believed that Kilgrave died after being hit by a bus. A new client soon shatters that illusion, as Jessica learns that another young woman, Hope, has been caught in Kilgrave's thrall.\n\nJessica's primary mission throughout the season is taking down Kilgrave and, in the process, coming to terms with her own abuse, but a secondary plot thread brings her into contact with a bar owner and ex-con named Luke Cage, who, she discovers, has special abilities of his own -- including unbreakable skin and, like Jessica, super-strength. Naturally, it doesn't take long for these two extra-special people to hook up, but matters are complicated when it's revealed that Luke's wife, Reva, who died under mysterious circumstances, was actually murdered by Jessica under Kilgrave's orders.\n\nAs you might imagine, this throws a bit of a wrench in Luke and Jessica's romance -- only exacerbated when Kilgrave takes control of Luke, forcing him to destroy his bar and attack Jessica. Our heroine narrowly manages to stop Luke by shooting him point-blank with a shotgun, leaving him unconscious and in need of medical attention -- which brings the two of them to the attention of Claire Temple, who, as we know, has plenty of experience with \"gifted\" individuals.\n\nJessica eventually succeeds in killing Kilgrave and ending his reign of terror across the city. Jeri helps get Jessica cleared of the murder charges and, although our hardboiled heroine is reluctant to return to the PI game, she's inundated with calls from prospective clients. Her best friend and adoptive sister, Trish Walker, is still in her corner and encourages her to keep helping people, but Luke decides to leave after recovering from his injuries rather than giving Jessica another chance, leaving all those messy, unresolved feelings still lingering...\n\nLuke Cage is the first Marvel series that begins after we've already met our protagonist. Back in Harlem at the start of his own series, Luke tries to keep his head down, but he's quickly swept up in the criminal activity of crime boss Cornell Stokes, aka Cottonmouth, after Luke's mentor, Pops, is killed in the barber shop that was one of Harlem's only neutral zones.\n\nAs the violence rises, the investigation also draws detective Misty Knight and our favorite, Claire Temple, into Luke's orbit -- both of whom end up hooking up with our stoic hero, natch: Misty for a one-night-stand, since she also ends up investigating Luke (awkward) for somehow always being adjacent to the trouble constantly plaguing Harlem, and Claire as a long-term girlfriend.\n\nAbout halfway through the season, everything changes: Cottonmouth is killed at the hand of his cousin Mariah, who frames Luke for the murder with the help of Shades, a criminal who is working for the arms dealer known as Diamondback.\n\nUnfortunately for Luke, Diamondback's real name is Willis Stryker, and he's Luke's psychotic half-brother, and the dude who framed Luke for the crime that landed him in Seagate Prison in the first place.\n\nFlashbacks reveal other key elements in the show: Luke -- whose real name is Carl Lucas -- and Shades were in prison together, and Luke's super strength is the byproduct of a procedure that was meant to accelerate his healing after a brutal fight. Said procedure also gave him the opportunity to break out of Seagate when the experiment went wrong and caused an explosion. We also discover that Luke met his wife, Reva, when she was his prison psychiatrist (it sounds creepy, but it works).\n\nThe season has many characters and at least one too many villains (rule of thumb for every medium: all you need is Mahershala Ali), and it culminates in a massive street fight between Luke and his brother. Stryker is arrested and Luke -- cleared of his current crimes -- still ends up under arrest for breaking out of prison and assuming a new identity. Most importantly though, he and Claire kiss, and she says she knows a good lawyer... oh boy. -- Proma Khosla\n\nIron Fist tells the story of Danny Rand, a billionaire heir who's just resurfaced in New York, 15 years after his plane crashed in the Himalayas and his entire family was presumed dead. In fact, Danny's parents actually were killed in the crash, but Danny survived and was taken in by a group of warrior monks in the hidden city of K'un-Lun. Under their care, he's become a martial arts expert imbued with the power of the Iron Fist - an ancient mystical force that usually manifests on the show in the form of Danny's glowing, superpowered fist.\n\nIn New York, Danny tries to reclaim his place in the family business -- which has since been taken over by his father's old business partner, Harold Meachum, and his adult children Ward and Joy -- and basically runs around asserting his privilege against everyone who crosses his path.\n\nEventually, Danny discovers that Harold orchestrated the plane crash, and that Harold himself has died only to be revived by The Hand - the same order of evil mystical ninjas that caused such havoc on Daredevil. Unfortunately for Harold, Danny's job as the Iron Fist is to protect K'un-Lun, and the world at large, from The Hand.\n\nLong story short, the season ends with Harold getting killed (for, like, the third time) by Ward. Danny breaks The Hand's hold over his company, defeats a whole mess of ninjas, and tries to return to K'un-Lun with his girlfriend, a martial arts teacher and ex-member of The Hand Colleen Wing, only to find that the city has vanished and its guards are all dead.\n\nMeanwhile, Joy has met with Davos - a former friend of Danny's from K'un-Lun who thinks he's totally unqualified to be the Iron Fist (like many of us) - to talk about taking Danny out. Oh yeah, and Hand leader Madame Gao (whom you may remember from Daredevil) is still out there looking smug and sipping tea, plotting her next move. -- Angie Han", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories":

Sigourney Weaver playing the Big Bad is obviously one. But for many fans, seeing two particular characters uniting on screen may be the true highlight: Power Man and Iron Fist.\n\nFor decades, Luke Cage and Danny Rand have had one of the great bromances in comics. Partners in crime-fighting and spandexed besties, the two have been linked together since the late 1970s, when they headlined their own comic, Power Man & Iron Fist. It was an offbeat, quirky book that often read like no other series Marvel was putting out at the time.\n\nMuch of the credit for that unique tone goes to writer Jo Duffy. Having earned her first break at Marvel as an editor, she soon took over the then-struggling comic, which had recently united both Power Man and Iron Fist in an effort to goose sales (both solo books were in danger of cancellation). Duffy was the writer on the series from issues #56-84. That three-year run set the template for how to properly approach these characters. Aside from having them deal with more grounded issues and bad guys in the Marvel U, Duffy focused on the character beats and gave their supporting cast ample room to shine. The result was a comic book that established one of the best friendships in comics.\n\nWith anticipation for the Netflix Defenders series peaking, SYFY WIRE thought it would be nice to reach out to the writer who established the blueprint for the Luke Cage/Danny Rand friendship. Duffy, whose stellar writing career included a memorable run on Star Wars, as well as work for Image, Dark Horse, and other publishers, was happy to go back down memory lane with us. She shared the story about how she landed the writing job on PM & IF, at a time in comics when female writers were still somewhat of an anomaly. She also tells us if she plans to binge-watch The Defenders this weekend (you'll have to read 'til the end for that!). FYI, she's active on Facebook too, if you want to pop in and say hello.\n\nBack when I was first reading Power Man & Iron Fist, I'm ashamed to say that I didn't pay much attention to the story credits. Looking back now, you really helped cement the relationship between the two characters during your run. The comic really became a buddy book under your direction.\n\nJO DUFFY: That's exactly what I wanted it to be. That's how I always saw those characters. We know, behind the scenes, that they're being put together because the Blaxploitation craze and the chop-socky kung fu craze is winding down too, so we're just going to splice 'em together. I happened to love both characters individually. As a fan, I was reading their books. My first question as a fan would be, \"Why are these guys working together? What makes them friends?\" That was my whole approach to the series. And I have never had a better time [in my career] than working on those characters. And if it wasn't for the vicissitudes of office politics, an executive coming in and wanting to go in a different direction, I could see myself writing them to this day.\n\nWhat made you such a fan of them before you hopped onboard the book?\n\nIt was perfectly obvious to me that Iron Fist was borne out of Kung Fu, which was borne out of Lost Horizon, and it's like, \"OK. I love both of those things. What does this have to do with the Marvel Universe and superheroes in the present day?\" I had a lot of fun doing Iron Fist because of that. With Luke, the one thing I didn't feel ... qualified to do was address the injustices that some of our society perpetrates on people of color. I decided I would just stay away from that whole angle of that part of his life. He suffered tremendous injustices, which led to his becoming Power Man. But I didn't think that remained central to his character at the time [I took over]. I never tried to write him as a black man so much as I was trying to write him as a man.\n\nAs a young reader it's easy to miss, but re-reading early Luke Cage, Hero for Hire and Power Man comics, one can't help but wince at the poorly scripted urban slang like \"jive turkey\" that was clearly written by white guys. You avoided much of that.\n\nI feel [that type of writing] was heartfelt by other writers, and meant to be sincere, but I have to say, I kept \"Sweet Sister\" and \"Christmas\" simply because I thought they were charming and they were part of the character's vernacular. But I consciously did not focus on him as strictly a black character, but as just a wronged person, because I was worried it would be embarrassing for me and would come across as condescending, or worse.\n\nDid you pitch [then editor-in-chief] Jim Shooter on taking over the book, or did they approach you for the job?\n\nNeither! [laughs] My friend Chris Claremont, one of my favorite writers, was way overbooked. He had overcommitted himself, and it was clear he had more books on his plate than he could keep up with. So I went to Jim and said, \"Every assistant editor at Marvel who was interested in writing has a regular book, except me. Is there a book that might come available?\"\n\nI think Jim had in mind that maybe Chris would give up writing Ms. Marvel, and I would take that over. But what I really was hoping for was Power Man & Iron Fist. Thing is, Chris was crazy for Ms. Marvel and had big plans for the character. He was great with Iron Fist, and did a wonderful run on the book. But it was clear his interest there was more with Colleen Wing and Misty Knight than it was with Iron Fist himself. Chris got to make the call, and to my inner glee, he said, \"I'm keeping Ms. Marvel, and Jo can have Power Man & Iron Fist.\"\n\nAnd that was how I got that assignment. Jim was very fair about if an assistant editor worked hard and paid his/her dues, and wanted to take over a regular book, he would support that. He was a great help to me getting it. But I do think he was hoping that the girl would write the girl comic and Chris would do Power Man & Iron Fist.\n\nHow did the office politics impact your work on the book? There weren't many female writers at Marvel back in the 1970s, were there?\n\nI think I was the first regular female writer in a while on a Marvel book. There had been some women writing occasional issues, but for x number of years before I landed Power Man & Iron Fist, I think all the writers were men. But I have to say, I just remember having the best time on that comic. I couldn't have been happier.\n\nThe fact that we spliced together these two books that were headed towards cancellation, and then it wound up going from a struggling bi-monthly to a monthly, to suddenly other people felt they were better qualified to write it than I was ... I mean, that irritated, hell, it devastated me. But on the other hand, it was a huge compliment to me. No one jumps onto a sinking ship unless they're an idiot like I was, where I thought I could pilot this ship to a new destination [laughs].\n\nI find it interesting that it was the woman in the Marvel Bullpen who was writing what was the best \"buddy comic\" on store shelves at the time. That speaks to something, because obviously, equality in comics is a big topic today. But 40 years ago, you were blazing trails not on Ms. Marvel or another female comic book but with a comic about a bulletproof black man and a martial arts master.\n\nThat is exactly what I wanted to do. I loved my bulletproof black man and my martial arts master, and I think Chris did a much better job with Ms. Marvel than I ever would have. It's a big credit to Jim that he let Chris make the call on his own. The funny thing is, for the early part of my career, I overwhelmingly wrote action-adventure tough-guy comics. It wasn't until much later, in the late '80s, that I became associated with girl books. That was around time when the seeds of the \"bad girl\" comics phase began, and lasted until the mid-'90s. That's when I would get calls to give Barb Wire a try, let's ask Jo to write Catwoman for a year, let's ask Jo what she would like to do with Glory. That was after years of doing Power Man & Iron Fist, of doing The Punisher and Hercules, and yada yada.\n\nYou don't write who you are, you write who you're interested in. And I've always been interested in buddy stories.\n\nWhat sparked that interest?\n\nIt probably started when I read my first Hardy Boys book or Spin & Marty. Sure, I read Nancy Drew. But I never asked myself \"What happened to her?\" after the book was over. But I asked myself that question after read the Hardy Boys. Now you go forward 20 years, and it's Power Man & Iron Fist.\n\nThe supporting cast, from Jeryn Hogarth, who really was the person who put Heroes For Hire together, to Misty Knight and Colleen Wing, were integral to the book. Whether it was Misty's PTSD from the explosion that took her arm, to Colleen worried about losing her business ... these were things not happening for supporting cast members in books without \"Spider-Man\" in the title.\n\n[Laughs] What can I say? Stan Lee was absolutely my idol. Always was, and I loved what he did with supporting casts, especially in Amazing Spider-Man. I don't think I set out to copy that, but on a subliminal level, I guess I picked up that you can't stand real people or characters up against a bogus canvas and have anybody care about them. It couldn't just be Luke and Danny were real; everyone around them had to be real and had to matter. And that's where you get a lot of your interesting storylines.\n\nThe occasional appearance by the Living Monolith notwithstanding, this was a very grounded book. It was very street-level. And you had some incredible artists work with you on this. Marie Severin, Kerry Gamill, just to name a few. Was it easy to find artists to work with on this comic?\n\nMark Bright, Trevor Von Eedon as well. I was incredibly lucky. Around this time, Marvel would soon get more organized and structured, editors began controlling assignments more. \"You do this, you do that.\" But when I first came in, and comics sales were in the doldrums and we were still decades away from big-budget comic book movies, you did things at the grassroots level. You went to your buddy and told him you have a series you'd like to work with him on, and do you want to do it?\n\nKerry had done a Star Wars fill-in issue for me when I was the regular writer on that book, that didn't actually see print until much later. I was crazy about it. I thought, \"Man, if we get an opening at some point, we've gotta grab Kerry. I'm dying to work with him again. He would be so perfect for these characters.\"\n\nAny of the villains from your run that you look back fondly on? Like \"El Aguila\"?\n\nWell, credit where credit is due. El Aguila was designed by Dave Cockrum. Dave was my buddy, and he had a sketchbook full of fabulous characters that didn't have series. He would just come up with a costume design and a great-looking character. If you were lucky enough as a writer for Dave to say, \"Sure, use this one,\" then you got to invent the powers, the personality ... but the look was pure Dave. I told him I wanted to do a Zorro type character, and he said, \"Well, step into my office. I happened to have designed what I think Zorro would have looked like if he had been a superhero.\" It was a great favor to me.\n\nHave you seen the Marvel Netflix series Luke Cage and Iron Fist?\n\nI have not seen any of the series. I've read up on them, but no, haven't seen them. I'm thrilled to see that both have made it on to television. People have been trying to get Luke Cage on screen for 20 years, so I'm very happy it's finally happened.\n\nBut I ... it's a problem I have, to enjoy the work of anyone who follows me on a character, because I find myself going, \"Wait. That's not how his powers work! He would never say that! He may have been born in K'un L'un, but he was raised an American!\" et cetera, et cetera. So it kind of impairs my enjoyment. But I will say, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is a notable exception. But I began taking note of Power Man on the Ultimate Spider-Man series on Disney XD, and loved that he was a teenager with parent issues. Yay!\n\nThen on Netflix, he's got this incredibly dark story going on on Netflix.\n\nMarvel's The Defenders is debuting this weekend. Do you plan to watch?\n\nI'm actually very interested now to see it because of the team-up factor. I have given myself a binge weekend to watch it all. But I do have to get over my whole thing. I mean, they married him to someone other than Harmony, and for good measure, you killed her? Oh, the pain!

When they practice dark magic, profit from the drug trade and attempt to take over New York, though, not so much. All of that is true about the sinister group known as The Hand, which has set itself up as the main force of evil in the Marvel Netflix corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nThe Hand will be front and center later this week in The Defenders, with smart money on the idea that the ninja clan will be connected to Sigourney Weaver's mysterious Alexandra in a very direct way. Speaking of connections, two of the Defenders have very concrete ties to The Hand while the other two will be facing off against the group for the first time. Let's take a look.\n\nJust as in the comics, Matt Murdock has been tangled up with The Hand more than he'd care to be. We learned this in season 1 of Daredevil when we met Stick, the blind master who taught Matt how to fight. Stick is a member of a group called The Chaste, which has devoted itself to battling The Hand and preventing its worldwide grab for power. In fact, Stick hoped to recruit Matt as a \"solider\" in that fight, but Murdock had other ideas.\n\nThe Hand had an even bigger presence in season 2, becoming the main threat that menaced Hell's Kitchen. Though eventually defeated by Daredevil and Elektra, his former lover turned assassin (with an assist from the Punisher), the final scene of the season showed us that Elektra had been resurrected by the ninjas.\n\nThat's because she's what The Hand calls the \"Black Sky,\" a mythical and supposedly unstoppable weapon (though the previous Black Sky was, in fact, stopped). Elektra is almost certainly going to be fighting to further the ends of The Hand in The Defenders, making the battle quite personal for Matt.\n\nIn a bit more of a change from the source material, Danny Rand also knows all too well how evil The Hand can be. As the protector of K'un-Lun, Rand's entire goal as the Iron Fist was to take down the group.\n\nHis ally/love interest Colleen Wing also has intimate knowledge of The Hand thanks to her time working for Bakuto, one of the group's faction leaders. She's since joined Danny in his fight, but when the first season of Iron Fist ended, it seemed they were a long way from accomplishing their goal.\n\nIssues of Marvel Comics have never made The Hand a complicated organization. Shadowy and mysterious, yes, but not complex in terms of motivation. The group wants as much power as possible, serves a legendary demon known only as \"The Beast\" and is willing to do just about anything to get what it craves.\n\nBringing someone back from the dead to serve as its thrall? That's a page straight out of the comic book version's playbook.\n\nMany different people, including various supervillains and even Matt Murdock himself, have served as the leader of The Hand in print. That's why it makes sense that Weaver's Alexandra could easily be the person that's really in charge in The Defenders. We won't know until the series premieres on Netflix, but fortunately that time is almost upon us.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100, "id": 679, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 100, "id": 680, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts", "wgt": 100, "id": 850, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Textiles", "wgt": 100, "id": 985, "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Textiles"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "wgt": 100, "id": 1179, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Decorative_Painting", "wgt": 100, "id": 1322, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Decorative Painting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Textiles", "wgt": 100, "id": 1561, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Textiles"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Esoteric_and_Occult", "wgt": 100, "id": 1644, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Esoteric and Occult"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature", "wgt": 100, "id": 1685, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Nature"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Kitchen,_Manhattan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell's Kitchen"}, "type": "loc", "id": "217604"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302687", "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "304577", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "314952", "label": {"eng": "Sigourney Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342245", "label": {"eng": "Punisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "348531", "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "349437", "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "351103", "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "354796", "label": {"eng": "Ninja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenders_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "358975", "label": {"eng": "Defenders (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Fist_(comics)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "431572", "label": {"eng": "Iron Fist (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(Mirage_Studios)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "471733", "label": {"eng": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Wing", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "555508", "label": {"eng": "Colleen Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hand_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "652996", "label": {"eng": "The Hand (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "714041", "label": {"eng": "Features of the Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaste_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1033070", "label": {"eng": "Chaste (Marvel Comics)"}}]}

But the MCU also has room for smaller, \"ground level\" stories, and that's where Marvel's slate of Netflix series comes in. Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist have all launched their own series on the streaming service, and now they've come together for The Defenders.\n\nMarvel's Netflix heroes (and villains) exist in the same world as Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor, but they have yet to interact with their more famous counterparts. There are a number of logistical and creative reasons why that hasn't happened yet (and why it may never happen), and while that's a bummer, it makes a certain kind of sense. Most normal people living in the MCU will never catch a glimpse of Thor, let alone meet him, and while the Netflix heroes aren't really normal, they're certainly more relatable to your average Netflix viewer than a Thunder God from a distant universe.\n\nBut while the Avengers and the Defenders haven't shared a screen together, the Netflix series are sprinkled with references to the wider MCU. These are the 15 Biggest MCU Connections In Marvel's Netflix Shows.\n\n15. Hunting Superheroes\n\nSuperheroes aren't always popular. That concept was explored in Captain America: Civil War, in which the Avengers had to come to terms with the collateral damage they had caused around the world and accept (or fight against) government oversight.\n\nJessica Jones encountered a similar kind of superhero backlash, albeit on a smaller scale. In the episode \"AKA 99 Friends\", she is contacted by a woman who enlists her detective services to follow her cheating spouse. That's just a ruse, however, as the woman lures Jessica into a trip with the intention of killing her. It's an act of revenge for the death of the woman's mother during the events of The Avengers, when superheroes and aliens waged a cataclysmic battle in the streets of New York. Of course, Jessica wasn't even part of those events, but to some people, all superpowered \"freaks\" are the same.\n\n14. Mocking Your Henchmen\n\nIt's not easy being a gangster in New York City, especially when superheroes are around to thwart your every move.\n\nIn the early stages of Daredevil's first season, \"Kingpin\" Wilson Fisk and his right hand man Wesley rely on their associates in the Russian mob to deal with the mysterious \"man in black\" who is interfering with their business. Of course, that darkly clad vigilante is a prototypical Daredevil, and he's a lot more than your average gangster can handle.\n\nAfter the Russians try (and fail) to eliminate this threat to Fisk's criminal empire, Wesley expresses his displeasure with their inability to handle one (presumably) normal guy: \"If he had an iron suit or a magic hammer, maybe that would explain why you keep getting your asses handed to you.\"\n\n13. Bootleg Avengers\n\nThere are three kinds of people you'll find at the scene of any dangerous situation: those running closer to help, those running away to safety, and those pulling out their phones to film whatever is going on.\n\nIt stands to reason that the people of the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be no different. Whenever superheroes are in action, there will always be people who will pull out their phones and film everything they can in the endless pursuit of \"likes\" and \"shares\".\n\nIn Civil War, we learned that Spider-Man was a YouTube sensation long before he met Tony Stark. Similarly, in an episode of Luke Cage, the titular hero is walking down the street when he's accosted by a man hocking raw footage of the Avengers and their battle with the Chitauri: \"Tony Stark. The big blond dude with the hammer. The old dude with the shield. The green monster, and I don't mean Fenway!\"\n\n12. Cops Need Magic Hammers\n\nThe relationship (and the inherent conflict) between the police and superheroes has always been complicated. Even the most altruistic superheroes are often vigilantes who are taking the law into his or her own hands. Some police officers are able to make peace with that contradiction and work alongside their city's respective heroes, but others resent them as interlopers and criminals.\n\nThen there are cops like Misty Knight's jaded (and crooked) partner Rafael Scarfe. He raises an interesting point when he tells Knight that the mere existence of superheroes like the Avengers renders cops completely redundant. \"Unless this sidearm that I'm wearing suddenly turns into some kind of magic hammer, this whole job is irrelevant.\"\n\nWhile it's certainly true that heroes like Thor and the Hulk can do more damage to the forces of evil in a day than a regular cop with a gun could do in a lifetime, that doesn't make the MCU's police irrelevant to the public they serve. Still, seeing the police confront this dynamic adds depth to the stories Marvel is telling.\n\n11. Fight Night In Harlem\n\nThe Incredible Hulk is a somewhat forgotten (and arguably underrated) entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Edward Norton as Bruce Banner (before Mark Ruffalo took over the role for The Avengers), it has been referenced sparingly in later films. But it can't be completely forgotten. After all, long before the Avengers battled aliens in New York, the Hulk and Abomination almost broke Harlem in half with their titanic battle.\n\nHarlem, of course, is where Luke Cage hangs his hat. Granted, the damage the Hulk and his rival made has long since been repaired (as has any left by the Avengers), but the memories of the big green guy are still fresh in the mind of the locals. After all, you never forget the sight of a giant monster throwing cars around like they're paperweights.\n\n10. Roxxon Corporation\n\nRoxxon Corporation is like the bad penny of the Marvel Cinematic Universe: they just keep turning up. In the MCU (and in the comics that inspire it) Roxxon Corp. is basically your standard evil conglomerate that will steamroll anyone and anything in the pursuit of profits.\n\nRoxxon has appeared in a number of MCU projects, from every film in the Iron Man trilogy to Agent Carter. Elektra engages in some corporate espionage at Roxxon's expense during Daredevil's second season. We also know that the company has dealings with The Hand.\n\nThe most interesting bit of Roxxon backstory, though, is that Matt Murdock and his partner Foggy Nelson became disenfranchised with life at a big law firm while representing the conglomerate. Forced to defend the interests of Roxxon against a single aggrieved employee, they decided to quit and start their own firm in Hell's Kitchen. And the rest is history...\n\n9. Crusher Creel\n\nLike a lot of superheroes, Daredevil suffered the tragedy of losing his parents at a young age. His mother abandoned their family and eventually became a nun, while his father was a boxer who was murdered after he refused to throw a fight.\n\nIn \"Cut Man\", we learned that fight was against a young boxer by the name of Carl \"Crusher\" Creel. He's not glimpsed on screen, but fans of the other MCU televised property, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., have seen him before. On that show (which is set in the present day, long after his fight with Murdock) Creel has appeared as the Absorbing Man, a villain with the power to transform his skin into any substance he touches.\n\nHe was last seen working for the government as hired muscle, but it'd be fun to see him return to his villainous roots for a showdown with the younger Murdock.\n\n8. Seagate Prison\n\nIt's not quite the Arkham Asylum of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Seagate Prison is close. It's where Luke Cage (or Carl Lucas, if you prefer) was sent for a crime he didn't commit, and it's also where he received his powers thanks to botched experimentation by Dr. Noah Burstein. While he's there, he meets rivals Shades and Comanche, but there are more notable names elsewhere in the prison.\n\nIn the MCU short film All Hail The King, we see that \"The Mandarin\" from Iron Man 3, aka actor Trevor Slattery, is imprisoned at Seagate, as is Iron Man 2 villain Justin Hammer. We don't see them in Luke's prison flashbacks, and it's unclear whether they were at the prison before or after him.\n\nIt's a pretty big prison, so it's conceivable that they never ran into each other. Still, it's fun to think of all of the MCU's vanquished criminals hanging out in Seagate, and who knows, maybe we'll see that one day.\n\n7. Hammer Tech\n\nJustin Hammer was a thorn in Tony Stark's side in Iron Man 2, but the cocky arms dealer ended up in jail and hasn't been heard from since (except to mock his fellow Seagate inmate Trevor). His company is still making weapons though, and just like in the comics, they're happy to outfit Marvel villains with the latest and deadliest.\n\nThere are a number of references to Hammer Tech in Luke Cage, with both Cottonmouth and Diamondback utilizing the company's latest technology. The Judas bullets that are capable of piercing Luke's unbreakable skin are a Hammer product, as is the suit Diamondback wears in his climactic battle with his old rival.\n\nIt's probably safe to assume that Hammer weapons will continue to be a problem for the MCU's heroes, even with the company's founder behind bars.\n\n6. Trish Talk\n\nJessica Jones spends a lot of time with her best friend Trish Walker. A former child star, Trish is now a popular talk show host who constantly encourages Jessica to use her gifts to help people, all while preparing for her own heroic career (she's Hellcat in the comics).\n\nA lot of New Yorkers are skeptical and even afraid of the incredibly powerful heroes in their midst, but Trish uses her pulpit to stand up for these larger than life figures. She often fields calls from people complaining about the mess heroes leave behind (yes, it's another reference to The Avengers), but she always tries to show them the positive side of what heroes like Captain America and Thor (and more locally, Daredevil and Luke Cage) are doing.\n\n5. Talking Superheroes\n\nWith all of the Netflix shows based in New York, it's only natural that the Avengers are a popular topic of conversation. Their headquarters dominates the skyline, after all.\n\nWhat's odd (and a little grating at times) is the refusal to reference those famous characters by name. Whether Luke is talking to Jessica about \"the big green dude and his crew\" or she's muttering an aside about \"the flag-waver\", their actual names are never used.\n\nIt's hard to believe that there's some rights issue preventing names like Captain America and Hulk from being used on the Netflix properties. It's all Marvel product, after all. And if it's simply a creative choice, it's an odd one.\n\nWhatever the reason, whenever you watch one of Marvel's Netflix shows, you're bound to hear something about \"that guy in the iron suit\" or \"the blond guy with the hammer.\"\n\n4. Crazy Powerful\n\nWhen Iron Fist begins, Danny Rand is returning to New York City for the first time since he was a kid. He doesn't get the welcome he expects, though. Since Danny and his parents were declared dead years ago, his old friends assume he's just some crazy homeless guy and have him thrown in a psych ward.\n\nWhile Danny's there, he has an interesting conversation with the doctor assigned to treat him. Danny tells everyone who will listen that he's the Immortal Iron Fist, sworn enemy of The Hand, and he's got this awesome glowing fist.\n\nThe audience knows he's not crazy, but the doctor doesn't. In fact, the psychiatrist explains that ever since the emergence of Iron Man, crazy people have been coming out of the woodwork to claim that they too have superpowers.\n\nIt's a humorous bit of background information, and it's probably what would happen if superheroes existed in our world, too.\n\n3. Stan Lee Is Watching\n\nStan (The Man) Lee is everywhere in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The legendary comic book writer has a cameo in almost every Marvel-related film and television project, and the Netflix shows are no different. He hasn't appeared in person, but instead has been spotted as a policeman in photos and posters around the city.\n\nOf these Netflix \"cameos\", the most notable might be the \"See A Crime? Report It!\" poster that can be seen on the streets of Harlem in Luke Cage. What makes it notable? Well, if you stayed until the end of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, you saw Stan Lee's cameo as a particularly long-winded member of The Watchers, an alien species that, well, watches history unfold from the sidelines.\n\nThat would suggest all of Stan Lee's MCU characters are the same character - a Watcher in disguise - which lends a fun bit of depth to the idea of policeman Stan. He's always watching!\n\n2. Ben Urich's Bylines\n\nBen Urich is a fairly notable character in Marvel lore, at least as far as reporters go. Vondie Curtis-Hall was great as Urich in Daredevil's first season, and it was a shame to see him get killed off. We glimpsed his tenacity and dedication as an investigative reporter as he and Karen Page pursued the story of Wilson Fisk's corruption (a story that ultimately got him killed).\n\nHis office at the New York Bulletin was filled with references to some of the biggest stories he covered throughout his long career, and a couple of them are especially notable. Unsurprisingly, Urich was on the scene when the Avengers and Loki's Chitauri forces clashed in New York. That's not the only time he risked his life to get a superhero story, though: he also reported on the \"Harlem Horror\" that was the Hulk's fight with Abomination.\n\n1. \"The Incident\"\n\nThe MCU moves in real time (or close to it), which means it's been at least five years since the Chitauri invasion of New York. Most of the city's visible scars have healed in that time, but an alien invasion that kills thousands isn't something that anyone ever forgets.\n\n\"The Incident\" is the accepted in-universe term for the events of The Avengers, and it's referenced constantly in all of the Netflix shows: and not just by name, either. We're constantly seeing examples of the fallout from the Avengers battle to save the city and the world.\n\nMany New Yorkers are as afraid of the heroes who saved them as they were of the alien invaders. Those with powers are often viewed with mistrust and even hatred.\n\nThe physical toll that the Chitauri attack had on the city also had some interesting consequences. Most notably, it devastated Hell's Kitchen, allowing Wilson Fisk to ramp up his campaign to gentrify the neighborhood (and spread his influence).\n\n--\n\nDid we miss any other MCU connections in the Marvel Netflix shows?

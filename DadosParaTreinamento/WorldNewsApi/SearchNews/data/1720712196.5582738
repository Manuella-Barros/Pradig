{"id": 231952372, "title": "Arne Slot makes first Liverpool transfer call after links with \u00a340m Newcastle star", "text": "New Liverpool boss Arne Slot is not interested in an Anfield reunion with Newcastle winger Yankuba Minteh. Slot previously managed Minteh at Feyenoord, with the teenager netting 11 goals and providing six assists in 37 appearances across all competitions last season after joining the Dutch club on loan. As a result, Minteh has been linked with a move to Liverpool with Newcastle said to be open to selling the player this summer. The Gambian international is valued at around \u00a340million, but the Liverpool Echo are reporting that a move to Anfield is not on the table. The report states that, despite Slot's 'admiration' of Minteh and the fact that Liverpool are interested in signing a new winger, the 19-year-old is not currently on their radar. Speaking earlier this year, Slot hailed Minteh's development in an interview with Dutch broadcaster Ziggo Sport. \"He has mainly played a lot in his native country, where very few tactics are involved,\" Slot said. \"If you are that fast, it is a huge weapon. One action and he is gone, then you will not catch up with him again. I think that his choices are already improving in the final phase. The bad thing for us is that if his choices become really good, he will probably no longer play for us.\" There is also said to be interest in Minteh's services from clubs in Italy and Germany, with Newcastle considering cashing in on him to comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability (PSR) rules. And in response to speculation about his future, Minteh told Voetbal International: \"I don't know what plans the club has for me or what the future looks like. Maybe Newcastle wants to loan me out again. \"Ultimately, the Premier League is my goal and Newcastle is the club that has a lot of confidence in me. I will let everything happen and one day I will be playing in the Premier League.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Immersive and interactive language lessons These aren't the stale language lessons Dad took in high school. Rosetta Stone's language lessons are designed to be immersive, and they're available for any level of knowledge, from beginner to advanced, and can be completed on his own time. What makes Rosetta Stone so effective is that it starts students off with its word and image-matching series, which most people do to learn their native language. Once your old man's mastered that, he can move on to more interactive lessons. Go to direct checkout now to surprise Dad with Rosetta Stone. Dad can practice his pronunciation with a little help from Rosetta Stone's state-of-the-art speech recognition technology. He can also listen and compare his accent. Either way, this tech can hear and analyze Dad's words up to 100 times per second, and it'll offer feedback on his pronunciation so his accent is parfait (that's perfect in French!). If your dad doesn't like just learning random words, he'll enjoy how Rosetta Stone provides practical lessons on topics he can actually use. They might open new doors for him on his next vacation or business trip. Or, at the very least, he might not need to look up how to ask for the restroom.

A double from Simon Murray sandwiched a Jordan White header to all but end the tie as a contest, before Brandon Khela put the icing on the cake in the closing minutes to win 4-0 on the day, and 6-1 on aggregate to ensure top flight football would be returning to Dingwall in the 2024/25 campaign. A fast start from County set the tempo for the whole match, but it was the visitors who grew into the game and began to threaten goal on a regular basis. Liam Dick and Sam Stanton each forced saved out of Ross Laidlaw, but it would be the Staggies who opened the scoring. Will Nightingale sent a cross into the middle towards Jordan White, who could not reach the ball, but Simon Murray was on hand at the back post to head in with a simple finish. That put the hosts 3-1 ahead on aggregate in Dingwall, putting them in a commanding position. Raith responded well though, with Lewis Vaughan and Dylan Easton the next to take aim at goal \u2013 albeit unsuccessfully. Just before the interval Ryan Leak made an important block inside his own six-yard box, and County would go on to take full advantage by making it 2-0 on the day in the 47th minute. Yan Dhanda\u2019s corner found Jordan White, who powered a header past Kevin Dabrowski to give the Staggies a three-goal advantage on aggregate. County would make absolutely sure of the victory in the 75th minute, when Murray drilled home an effort into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Immediately afterwards, there was a nice moment for Dhanda as he was substituted off and received a standing ovation from the home side\u2019s supporters as he walked off the pitch as a Ross County player for the final time. While Raith would try to reward their fans, who travelled north in great numbers, with a goal, the closest they came was when Easton forced Ross Laidlaw into a good stop. County would add another to their tally before the end of play, though, with Brandon Khela curling into the bottom in the 87th minute to put the icing on the cake for the home fans.

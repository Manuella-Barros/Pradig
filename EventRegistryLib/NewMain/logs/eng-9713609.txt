Authorities have not said how 31-year-old Deundray Cottrell was killed.\n\nThe search continues for 31-year-old Julian Taylor Morris, who authorities and family have said had a romantic relationship with Cottrell. Fitzgerald called Morris a person of interest.\n\nMorris has not been seen since Friday morning.\n\nCottrell was last seen about 10 p.m. Thursday in the 7000 block of Fourth Avenue South.\n\nHis sister, Angelica Harris, said Cottrell and Morris got to Birmingham about 6 p.m. Thursday to celebrate the holiday. It was her brother's first time seeing the new home she shares with her husband and children.\n\nCottrell lived in Atlanta where he worked in marketing and was working toward his doctorate degree.\n\nAbout 10 p.m., Cottrell said he was going upstairs to check on his dog, because of the fireworks.\n\n\"He went and checked on the dog and I never saw him again,'' Harris said.\n\nMorris also was in the house and told family they had a conversation and the Cottrell had left and took off running through the backyard.\n\nFamily members found Cottrell's sunglasses, cell phone and one of his shoes when they began their search for him. Morris, family said, was acting erratically and not like they've known him to act for the past three years. The family immediately began a search and eventually called police to file a missing person's report.\n\nHarris said they later learned he wasn't actually entered into the system as missing until Friday morning.\n\nCottrell's family searched for him throughout Friday and Friday night but to no avail. They did track down Ring camera footage at several homes that showed Cottrell running through yards, and even jumping over a gate.\n\n\"It looked like he was looking for refuge,'' Harris said. \"He was running for his life.\"\n\nMorris then possibly went missing on Friday. Cottrell's family saw Morris Friday morning but did not see him after that.\n\nOfficer Truman Fitzgerald said also on Friday, East Precinct officers began searching the area where Cottrell was last seen. They recovered some of his clothing, and a community member provided officers with surveillance footage of Cottrell walking in the area.\n\nOn Saturday, family again launched another search, as did Birmingham police.\n\n\"He's a well-loved, well-known, good hearted person and there's a lot of people hurting from him being gone,'' Harris said before Cottrell was found dead. \"What's happening doesn't make sense.\"\n\nJust before 3 p.m., officers found Cottrell dead in or near an abandoned house, and his family was notified.\n\nMorris was the last person who saw Cottrell alive, Fitzgerald said. He is described as a Black male, 5-feet, 6-inches tall and weighing 160 pounds.\n\nCottrell is Birmingham's 81st homicide this year. Of those, eight have been ruled justifiable and therefore aren't deemed criminal.\n\nIn all of Jefferson County, there have been 104 homicides, including the 81 in Birmingham.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to call homicide detectives at 205-254-7777 or Crime Stoppers at 205-254-7777.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Taylor_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Taylor (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Person of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coroner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missing person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

He was found dead in Birmingham days later under 'suspicious' circumstances.\n\nA family has been left reeling after the abrupt disappearance of a loved one resulted in a suspicious death.\n\nThe family of Deundray Cottrell, 31, last saw the doctorate student on the evening of July 4th, when he stepped away from a family gathering in Birmingham, Alabama to check on his dog. He walked upstairs never to be seen alive again, according to local outlets.\n\nCottrell's body was found under \"suspicious\" circumstances days later just a block away from where he was last scene, police said. The same day, his death was ruled a homicide and police issued public notice of a search for his partner, Julian Taylor Morris, who hasn't been seen since Friday morning.\n\nDoorbell footage recovered during the search reportedly captured Cottrell racing through yards and hopping gates as if he was \"looking for refuge,\" his family told local news organization AL.com.\n\nThe strange series of events has left Cotrell's loved ones and the community baffled. Here's what we know about the case so far.\n\nWho is Deundray Cottrell?\n\nDeundray Cottrell was a 31-year-old Atlanta-based doctorate student working on his PhD after receiving his master's degree in public administration and bachelor's in marketing, according to his Instagram.\n\nHe also used social media to show off his many other talents, including modeling, mixology and dance. Cottrell served as the CEO of the dance troupe Skiiboy and often made popular posts sharing his fashion sense and collaborating with different brands.\n\nCottrell was a \"well-loved, well-known, good-hearted person and there's a lot of people hurting from him being gone,'' his sister, Angelica Harris, told AL.com when Cottrell originally went missing.\n\nWhen did Deundray Cottrell go missing?\n\nCottrell originally went missing on the evening of Thursday, July 4.\n\nCottrell arrived in Birmingham from Atlanta Thursday to celebrate the holiday with his family, according to a police press release. He was spending time at a family member's home when, around 10 p.m., he told his sister he was going upstairs to check on his dog because of fireworks going off.\n\n\"He went and checked on the dog and I never saw him again,'' Harris told AL.com.\n\nPolice said they were called to the home that night when friends and family couldn't find Cottrell. He was last seen on foot, said police, and the family told AL.com that Cottrell's partner reported seeing him take off through the backyard after a conversation in the house.\n\nThe family told the local outlet that they found Cottrell's sunglasses, cell phone and one of his shoes while searching for him. Police later found some of Cottrell's clothing around where he went missing and reviewed surveillance footage from neighbors, which showed him walking in the area.\n\nCortell's family told AL.com that the recovered Ring doorbell footage showed him running through yards and jumping gates as if he was \"running for his life.\"\n\nThe family and police searched through Friday and into Saturday for Cottrell.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Birmingham Police and Harris for comment.\n\nDeundray Cottrell found dead\n\nUnfortunately, Cottrell was found deceased two days later around 3 p.m. on Saturday.\n\nPolice have yet to release the circumstances of Cottrell's death but did call it \"suspicious\" upon discovery. The same day, the Jefferson County Medical Examiner's Office performed an autopsy on Cottrell and ruled the manner of death homicide, the Birmingham Police Department announced online that evening.\n\nIt was also in that post that Julian Taylor Morris was named a person of interest in the investigation.\n\nWho is Julian Taylor Morris?\n\nJulian Taylor Morris, 31, was Cottrell's romantic partner and is a person of interest in the investigation. Police believe he may have been the last person to see or hear from Cottrell the evening of his disappearance.\n\nMorris and Cottrell initially came to Birmingham together to celebrate the holiday, Angelica Harris told AL.com.

He was last seen on foot, said police, and the family told AL.com that Cottrell's partner reported seeing him take off through the backyard after a conversation in the house.\n\nThe family told the local outlet that they found Cottrell's sunglasses, cell phone and one of his shoes while searching for him. Police later found some of Cottrell's clothing around where he went missing and reviewed surveillance footage from neighbors, which showed him walking in the area.\n\nCortell's family told AL.com that the recovered Ring doorbell footage showed him running through yards and jumping gates as if he was \"running for his life.\"\n\nThe family and police searched through Friday and into Saturday for Cottrell.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Birmingham Police and Harris for comment.\n\nUnfortunately, Cottrell was found deceased two days later around 3 p.m. on Saturday.\n\nPolice have yet to release the circumstances of Cottrell's death but did call it \"suspicious\" upon discovery. The same day, the Jefferson County Medical Examiner's Office performed an autopsy on Cottrell and ruled the manner of death homicide, the Birmingham Police Department announced online that evening.\n\nIt was also in that post that Julian Taylor Morris was named a person of interest in the investigation.\n\nJulian Taylor Morris, 31, was Cottrell's romantic partner and is a person of interest in the investigation.

(WBMA) -- The family of an Alabama man whose body was found in a shed wants answers as police continue to search for the last person authorities believe saw him alive.\n\nThe Birmingham Police Department said Julian Morris was named a person of interest after Deundray Cottrell was discovered dead two days after he was reported missing.\n\nThe two were said to be in a romantic relationship and were visiting Cottrell's family for the Fourth of July holiday. According to Cottrell's family, they had known each other for about three years.\n\nCottrell lived in Atlanta, Georgia, but grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, where his family still lives. Cottrell was visiting his sister's new home when he vanished.\n\n\"I don't want anyone to feel how we do. The confusion, the just -- worrying, trying to accept it,\" said Cottrell's brother, Timothy Cottrell.\n\nCottrell's loved ones said he stepped outside to check on his dog -- who is afraid of fireworks -- on Thursday. When he never came back in and he was nowhere to be found, police were called.\n\n\"I get a call from my sister, 'Bubba went missing.' That's what we called him,\" said Timothy Cottrell. \"We hit every spot in East Lake, went down every ally, had people in bushes, abandoned houses, just trying to figure out where.\"\n\nWhile friends and family searched, the department launched a missing person investigation. On Friday, officers recovered some of Cottrell's clothing in the area and a community member provided officers with surveillance video that showed him walking in the area.\n\n\"We searched for him that night. We searched for him the following day. We were able to find a clothing item of his in South Eastlake,\" said Birmingham Police Department's Public Information Officer Truman Fitzgerald.\n\nPolice said they found Cottrell's body in a shed in the backyard of an abandoned house Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"It's tough. A lot of people take it tougher, because we consistently went passed that shed -- we consistently went passed that shed -- numerous times, retracing his steps,\" said Timothy Cottrell, noting he never though his brother was in the shed. \"It's a blessing and a curse because how would we react if we found him ourselves, that whole look and idea, but just knowing he was in the shed the entire time. We passed, kept going by it. We didn't want to break any laws.\"\n\nThe coroner ruled Cottrell's death a homicide.\n\n\"He never hurt no one, so for someone to hurt him, it's ironic, it's strange. We started questioning, like, he's not that type of person, so what would he done to you to make you feel you needed to do that?\" said Timothy Cottrell.\n\nThe search is underway for Morris.\n\n\"He was the last one to be with my brother when he was alive, now he's nowhere to be found,\" said Timothy Cottrell. \"Julian, where are you?\"\n\nPolice named Morris as a person of interest.\n\n\"We need to speak to him because he may hold crucial information in this investigation,\" said Fitzgerald.\n\nFitzgerald said it is possible he could be in danger, but it is also possible he could be a suspect in this case.\n\n\"That's why it's important he comes forward,\" said Fitzgerald. \" Deundray was well loved, I can safely say the entire state of Alabama, possible areas of Georgia are looking for Julian Morris. It's important for him to come forward, turn himself in, we are confident that the community when they see him, they will report him to the authorities.\"\n\nHe also noted their entire family is grateful for all the help searching for his brother, as well as for all of the support.\n\n\"It showed my brother was impactful wherever he went. Wherever he was, he touched people, enough to be a helping hand in his last hours. We are thankful for those people,\" said Timothy Cottrell. \"He was definitely loved out here and that makes us happy that he was that type of human being.\"\n\nAnyone who knows where Morris is or has any information about him should contact police or Crime Stoppers.", "source": {"uri": "abc45.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXLV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julian Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Person of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lake_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Lake Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

Authorities have not said publicly how he was killed.\n\nBirmingham police are searching for Morris, who has not been charged in Cottrell's death or publicly identified as a suspect in the death.\n\nPolice say they want to talk to Morris because he is the last person known to have seen Cottrell alive.\n\nHomicide detectives were back at the scene on Tuesday, canvassing the neighborhood, talking with family and searching for clues and evidence.\n\n\"He is a missing piece to this puzzle,'' Officer Truman Fitzgerald said of Morris. \"Our main focus right now is locating Julian.\"\n\n\"Everybody's interested in it because the story is so weird,'' said Cottrell's sister, Angelica Harris. \"As weird as it sounds to them, we're just as perplexed about it.\"\n\n\"We can't sleep and we're working overtime to make sense of it,'' Harris said. \"It doesn't add up.\"\n\nCottrell graduated from Woodlawn in 2011.\n\nHe attended Auburn University at Montgomery for a while and then completed his education with a bachelor's degree and master's degree in marketing from Jacksonville State University.\n\nAt the time of his disappearance and death, Cottrell was working on his doctorate.\n\nIn addition to the SkiiBoyz Entertainment, Cottrell did freelance marketing jobs, consulting for social media accounts, bartending and massage therapy. He also worked in photography.\n\n\"He was so ambitious, and did so many things,'' Harris said.\n\nCottrell was well-known and well-loved, she said.\n\n\"Though he was the chill person in the room, his energy was so high, it just drew people to him,'' Harris said.\n\n\"I can remember going shopping with him in the mall, and this was before SkiiBoyz, before all the social media, and people would say to him, 'Can I take a picture with you?'''\n\n\"He was a party,'' she said. \"Even if we were just watching a movie, he was going to make it funnier than it was supposed to be.\"\n\nCottrell and Williams had been in a relationship for 14 years, starting when Cottrell just 17.\n\nMorris joined the relationship about three years ago, and the three lived and worked together, Harris said.\n\nCottrell and Morris got into Birmingham about 6 p.m. on July 4th. It was the first time Cottrell had seen his sister's new home that that she shares with Brian Harris and their children.\n\nNormally, Williams would have been with them, but not this time.\n\n\"Usually when you saw one, you saw all three,'' Brian Harris said.\n\nThe close-knit family was celebrating the holiday at the large Harris home in the 7900 block of Fourth Avenue South.\n\nAbout 9 p.m., Cottrell went inside to check on his dog because of the fireworks.\n\n\"Julian sat there for a few minutes, and I think he slowly drifted away inside,'' Harris said. The family stayed outside to keep an eye on the kids because of the fireworks.\n\nAbout 10:15 p.m., she said, Morris reappeared.\n\n\"Julian comes up and grabs me on my arm and he said, 'Hey, your brother just jumped out of the window,''' Harris said. \"I stopped my husband and said, 'Hey, he said De just jumped out of a window.\"\n\nWhen Harris pointed out to Morris that her windows don't open, she said Morris told her, ''Oh, I'm sorry, he jumped off the balcony.''\n\n\"Everybody just pulls out their flashlights, we all go walking through the back yard, the alley, circling the block,'' Harris said.\n\nThe family found one of Cottrell's shoes, as well as his sunglasses and cell phone in the back yard. His hat was hanging on the fence post, just under the second-floor balcony.\n\n\"Once we didn't see anything on foot, we started driving,'' she said. \"For hours and hours.\"\n\nBirmingham police were called about midnight.\n\nThey took a missing person's report and drove around the neighborhood with spotlights looking for Cottrell.\n\n'In his own little world'\n\nMorris, she said, walked around the block one time with Brian Harris and then later walked the dog.\n\nShe said those were the only times she saw him leave the house during their search.\n\n\"He was sitting here eating and listening to music and in his own little world,'' Harris said.\n\nShe has described Morris's behavior as erratic and bizarre, and said she believed he was under the influence of something, which was not usual behavior for him.\n\nFamily and friends searched until about 1:30 a.m. Friday.\n\nHarris then told Morris that the family was about to try to sleep.\n\nWhile Morris had been set to sleep at Harris' house, she told him it would be better for him to go to her mother's house a few blocks away.\n\nMorris got into his car but did not go anywhere.\n\nFirst, he told her Cottrell had the keys, and then said he had had them himself, but didn't know where they were.\n\nHe ended up walking to Cottrell's mother's home.\n\n\"I called my mom to make sure he got there because we're not mean people,'' she said. \"All we knew was that my brother was missing, and we didn't suspect anything from him at that point.\"\n\n\"(He) wasn't making any sense from the point where he told us Deundray had jumped,'' she said.\n\n\"He had made it (to her mother's) and everybody was going to try to close their eyes so we could get back up in the morning and search more,'' Harris said. \"I was going to sleep on the couch in case De returned.\"\n\nA short time later, Harris heard loud music coming from outside.\n\n\"Julian starts to use his shoulder to jam at the door and he's wiggling the handle like he's going to get in the house,'' she said.\n\nHarris called her older sons and husband to come downstairs. She also called her brother, Tim Cottrell, who went to the home and stayed in his car up the street to keep an eye on things until the police could arrive.\n\n\"They made contact with Julian on more than one occasion since the word missing with Deundray came up,'' Harris said.\n\n'We're never going to find Deundray'\n\nIt was about 4 a.m. when police arrived, and Harris told them Morris was trying to break into the house.\n\nHarris said police eventually got Morris to leave, but he soon returned.\n\n\"While they're still there explaining stuff to us, he comes back'' she said. \"He reaches over into one of the police cars and they get him to go away again, and they leave.\"\n\nThe family couldn't go back to sleep so they sat on the porch talking. They saw Morris approaching again, and again called the police.\n\n\"They show up, they make contact with him, and told him not to come back,'' she said.\n\n\"As they're talking to him, he's (posing) and dancing and having outbursts,'' she said.\n\nAt one point he told the police, \"I'm a community serviceman, just like you. We do the same job.\"\n\nMorris had previously served as a U.S. Marine, according to authorities and the family. AL.com has reached out to the U.S. Marines to verify his reported service.\n\n\"He was talking to them in Spanish,'' Harris said. \"I'd never heard him talk in Spanish in the three years we've known him.\"\n\nHarris told the police, \"I know Julian. I've known him for three years, and this version of him, I've never met. And because he is this person right now, this is why he can't come back into our home.\"\n\nMorris was then trespassed -- meaning police issued him a written warning he would be arrested if he returned -- and he left.\n\nThey saw Morris one more time, between 6:30 a.m. and 7 a.m., and then did not see him again.\n\n\"When he saw my husband and sons, he went and hid in a ditch,'' Angelica Harris said.\n\n\"I don't know why,'' Brian Harris said. \"I just wanted to talk to him and see where Dre is.\"\n\n\"By this time, we have video and audio recordings of Julian telling us we're never going to find Deundray, that he committed suicide, all these things,'' Harris said.\n\nMorris later called the family, Harris said. \"I asked him where's the last place he's seen my brother at.\"\n\nMorris told her he saw him in a car, then he said he saw him in the grass.\n\n\"I'm like, 'Julian, make sense, where is the last place you saw him''' Harris said. \"He said, 'Su Casa.'''\n\nBy now, Williams had rushed to Birmingham from Atlanta, and the family continued the search.\n\n\"We go and hit every abandoned house in this area,'' Harris said.\n\nIt was Friday that the family tracked down home surveillance footage from neighbors that showed Cottrell, wearing only one shoe, running through back yards and jumping over a gate.\n\n\"It looked like he was looking for refuge,'' Harris said. \"He was running for his life.\"\n\n\"There's no footage of Julian,'' she said.\n\nThe footage ended in the 7800 block of Fifth Avenue, where Cottrell's body was eventually found by police on July 6. The shed was behind a vacant house at 7813 Fifth Ave. South.\n\n\"We had looked at that shed,'' Harris said. \"One of our family members even crawled under the crawl space of the house adjacent to the shed.\"\n\n\"We couldn't get into the shed because it was boarded up,'' Harris said. \"We tried to kick at it, and saw a hole but we were like, 'Nah, De too clean for that.'''\n\n\"Even if he was trying to hide, my brother wouldn't have crawled up in there,'' she said. \"He was not going to get dirty.\"\n\n\"Nobody else's camera caught him after that last camera on Fifth Avenue,'' she said.\n\nFamily members say they believe that Cottrell was running for his life in that footage and that \"some way, somehow, Julian met Dre in that alley,'' Brian Harris said.\n\nPolice have not said what they believe happened in the final minutes of Cottrell's life and what role, if any, Morris might have played in Cottrell's death.\n\n\"I feel like Julian told us a lot of answers that we needed to know because he was ranting and rummaging through his thoughts,'' she said. \"They didn't make sense to us then, but it makes a lot of sense now.\"\n\n'He was greatness, and he was love'\n\nHarris says she believes her brother was killed out of jealousy and possessiveness.\n\n\"It was a poly relationship,'' she said. \"Deundray and DeEric had been together for 14 years and Julian had only come into the equation about three years.\"\n\nWilliams has not publicly commented on Cottrell's death.\n\n\"From what I understand, Julian was starting cause issues between Deundray and De Eric,'' she said. \"He would start spats that would isolate DeEric and Deundray from each other.\"\n\nHarris said in hindsight, she didn't know much about Morris.\n\n\"We just knew that if DeEric and Deundray had invited him in and he was cool enough to be with them, he was fine,'' she said. \"His sister was flying in from Hawaii and spending holidays with us because she's in the military.\"\n\nShe said she spoke with Morris multiple times from the time her brother disappeared, the last time being at 12:12 a.m. on Saturday, the day Cottrell's body was found.\n\n\"At one point he called and told (us) he was safe and eating honeybuns and chips,'' she said.\n\nThe last time they spoke, Harris said, \"He said he didn't want to hear any updates, he didn't want anybody to call him, the only thing he wanted was to hear was a video call from Dre.\"\n\n\"I said, 'Are you sure about that?

He also has ties to Miami and New Jersey.\n\n\"The possibilities are endless,'' Harris said of where Morris might be.\n\nFitzgerald said there is a widespread misconception that Morris has been in touch with detectives.\n\n\"We are getting flooded with community members coming forward saying our homicide detectives have been in touch with Julian, and that is not the case,'' he said. \"No one in our homicide unit has spoken with Julian, nor have we seen Julian since Friday, July 5.\"\n\nThe family is focused on finding out for sure what happened to Cottrell and finding Morris.\n\n\"I can't wait to hear he has been captured,'' Harris said.\n\nAsked what Cottrell's legacy will be, Harris said, \"He was greatness, and he was love. His legacy is bigger than anything anybody could ever put into words.\"\n\nHer husband agreed.\n\n\"There's so many people he touched,'' Brian Harris said. \"It's amazing to see who he was not just to us but to everybody else.\"\n\nFuneral arrangements have not yet been made.

He's now considered a person of interest in his homicide.", "body": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- There are more questions than answers about what happened to a 31-year-old Atlanta man after he was found dead in a shed following his disappearance in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nDeundray Cottrell, who had lived in Atlanta for about ten years, had deep ties to Alabama. He graduated from Woodlawn High School in Birmingham in 2011 and Jacksonville State University in 2012. His sister, Angelica Cottrell, described her brother as a dancer, bartender, masseuse and a student working on his doctorate.\n\n\"He was not afraid to do the work,\" she said. She also always believed was bound for big things. \"At a very young age, my brother's personality was just too big for Birmingham,\" Angelica said.\n\nAngelica and her family are now searching for answers about his mysterious disappearance and death. Deundray arrived at his sister's home in Birmingham on July Fourth with his partner, Julian Collins, around 6 p.m.\n\n\"It's interesting because Deundray normally has such a busy schedule that it's not normal for us to see him for the Fourth of July,\" Angelica explained.\n\nBut this holiday was different. She noted that it was unusual for Deundray to visit without his other partner, DeEric. Deundray was a dancer and the CEO of Skiiboyz Entertainment, a male trio dance group based in Atlanta that included Julian and DeEric.\n\n\"DeEric had been around my brother for over 14 years,\" Angelica said, noting that Julian had only been in the picture since around 2020.\n\nDespite the oddity of the situation, Angelica said they had a good time, and Deundray assured her that everything was fine between the trio.\n\n\"It was about nine o'clock when the kids went out to shoot off fireworks, and that's when D (Deundray) decided he would go in and check on their dog,\" she explained, adding that was the last time she saw her brother alive.\n\nAn hour later, Angelica said Julian came out calmly and said Deundray had jumped out of a window. The family immediately began searching for him, but Julian stayed back, eating barbeque.\n\n\"He was way too chill,\" Angelica said.\n\nBirmingham Police got involved around 11 p.m. on the Fourth of July, and the following day, officers found a piece of Deundray's clothing near where he disappeared. A neighbor's home security footage showed Deundray in distress.\n\nAnd on July 6, officers found Deundray's body in an abandoned shed one block from where he went missing. The Jefferson County Medical Examiner's Office ruled his death a homicide.\n\nPolice have named Julian Morris a person of interest but have not identified him as a suspect. Despite online reports, Birmingham Police said Julian has not contacted their homicide unit.\n\n\"We need to speak to him as soon as possible,\" police said in a press conference.\n\nAngelica said she last saw Julian after asking him to leave her house following Deundray's disappearance.\n\n\"He was acting out of it,\" she said. \"Everyone was searching, he was eating, he had no sense of urgency.\"\n\nAngelica said she offered for him to stay at their mom's house just up the road. A few hours later, Julian woke them up and tried to get back into their home. She said they called the police and put him on trespass notice.\n\nShe said up until his body was found, Julian was calling her brother's phone.\n\n\"Like nonstop calls, all day. He called, he sent messages, he sent music through the text messages. Just the craziest of things,\" she said.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact the Birmingham Police Department's Homicide Unit at 205-254-1764 or Crime Stoppers at 205-254-7777.\n\n\"I thank Atlanta for embracing him, giving him his wings, allowing him to experience things that he probably never would have,\" Angelica said. \"My entire family is so grateful to everybody that has loved him, hugged him, encouraged him, motivated him. We're incredibly grateful to everybody.\"", "source": {"uri": "11alive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXIA-TV 11"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Morris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julian Morris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelica,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelica, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Angelica, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodlawn_High_School_(Birmingham,_Alabama)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woodlawn High School (Birmingham, Alabama)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Stoppers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime Stoppers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_County,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson County, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/b28a8316-5363-471d-af23-c8b552ebe9e6/20240709T014818/b28a8316-5363-471d-af23-c8b552ebe9e6_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713609", "eventUri": "eng-9713609", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 2304, "textEnd": 2310}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

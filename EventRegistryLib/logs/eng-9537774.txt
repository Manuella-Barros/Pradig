Mike Collins wrote Friday on X, with a link to the video showing the racist jeers. The AP left voicemail messages for Collins on Friday at his offices in Georgia and Washington and sent an email to his spokesperson, asking for an explanation of what Collins meant. There was no immediate response. The taunting brought sharp criticism on and off campus. \"Students were calling for an end to genocide. They were met with racism,\" James M. Thomas, a sociology professor at the University of Mississippi, wrote Friday on X.\n\nThe Rev. Cornell William Brooks, a former president and CEO of the NAACP and professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, wrote on X that a white man mocking a Black woman as a monkey \"isn't about 'Stand With Israel' or 'Free Palestine.' This is protest as performative racism.\" Collins was first elected to Congress in 2022 and has made several social media posts criticizing campus protests. Nobody was arrested during the demonstration Thursday at the University of Mississippi, where hecklers vastly outnumbered war protesters. According to a count by AP, more than 2,400 arrests have occurred on 46 US university or college campuses since April 17 during demonstrations against the war. The student newspaper, the Daily Mississippian, reported that about 30 protesters on the Oxford campus billed themselves as UMiss for Palestine.\n\nAbout 76% of the university's students were white and about 11% were Black in 2022-23, the most recent data available on the school's website. University of Mississippi Chancellor Glenn Boyce said the school is committed to people expressing their views. He said some statements made on campus Thursday were \"offensive and unacceptable.\" In another statement Friday, Boyce said one \"student conduct investigation\" had been opened, and that university leaders were \"working to determine whether more cases are warranted.\" \"To be clear, people who say horrible things to people because of who they are will not find shelter or comfort on this campus,\" he said. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, meanwhile, reposted a video on X that showed counterprotesters on the campus singing \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" \"Warms my heart,\" Reeves wrote. \"I love Mississippi!\" (More", "source": {"uri": "newser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jenn_gidman@newser.com", "name": "Jenn Gidman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mississippi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Mississippi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Kennedy_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Kennedy School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_William_Brooks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornell William Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sociology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Boyce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Boyce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Star-Spangled Banner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tate Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/image/1532942-12-20240504060846.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537774", "eventUri": "eng-9537774", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 1511, "textEnd": 1519}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Be in the moment when you're mocking the Hamas loving fat girl,\" Hanania wrote. The video has received over 1 million views as of Friday afternoon.\n\nThe video comes amid ongoing pro-Palestinian protests at a number of different colleges across the United States, including Ole Miss. Pro-Palestinian protesters are actively calling on colleges to divest from Israel in its ongoing war with Hamas militants in Gaza. Tensions across college campuses in the country have remained high since the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas that left 1,200 people dead. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its war in Gaza in response.\n\nThe video was reposted by Representative Mike Collins, a Georgia Republican, who wrote, \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\"\n\nIn the video, the Black female student can be seen walking toward a group of white students as they appear to mock and film her. As the video continues, law enforcement officials on campus can be seen attempting to breakup the confrontation and deescalate the situation.\n\nResponding to the post from Collins, Rob Smith, a U.S. veteran from the Iraq War, wrote, \"An elected official in the House of Representatives should absolutely not be tweeting out this video with this caption. This stuff is what makes the Republican Party absolutely toxic to the vast majority of Black Americans. This is so not the way.\"\n\nWarning: Viewer discretion is advised.\n\nIn a statement to Newsweek on Friday, a spokesperson for Ole Miss declined to comment on the video of the confrontation, but said, \"Statements were made at the demonstration on our campus Thursday that were offensive and inappropriate. Any actions that violate university policy will be met with appropriate action.\"\n\nMeanwhile, several other X users responded to Smith's post questioning his comments, including one who suggested that the confrontation wasn't \"racist.\"\n\n\"OK. This is not at all racist, racially charged. Just your normal white dude mocking a black protester by making monkey noises.

This is old-fashioned American racism and misogyny,\" said one observer. \"These are the types of young white men who will grow up to be Republican governors, senators, and members of Congress.\"\n\nRepublican Georgia Congressman Mike Collins came under fire Friday over a social media post applauding video of white University of Mississippi students racially abusing a Black woman participating in a campus protest for Palestine.\n\nCollins posted the video -- in which numerous people can be heard grunting like apes and one young man is seen jumping up and down like a monkey in front of the Black woman -- with the caption, \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\"\n\nCollins -- or whoever's in charge of his social media accounts -- sparred with Black leaders who called out his racism. When former Democratic Ohio state senator Nina Turner said the video showed \"anti-Blackness,\" the congressman shot back, \"*Anti-terroristness.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) accused Collins of \"fueling white supremacy,\" the Republican retorted, \"Don't take down any more signs at our workplace, please\" along with a photo of the Democrat triggering a fire alarm in a House of Representatives office building last year.\n\nAround 30 protesters were rallying in support of Palestine in the Ole Miss Quad when counter-protesters gathered near the demonstrators. Some booed and chanted, \"We want Trump!\" Others singled out the Black woman -- who NBC Newssaid is a graduate student at the school -- chanting \"Lizzo, Lizzo, Lizzo,\" \"take a shower,\" \"your nose is huge,\" \"fuck you, fat bitch,\" and \"lock her up!\"\n\nThe counter-protesters also sang the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" Republican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves shared a separate video of the singing students on social media, captioning his post, \"Warms my heart\" and \"I love Mississippi.\"\n\nNo racist language can be heard in the video shared by Reeves.\n\nThe Daily Mississippianreports the demonstrators were escorted off the Quad after counter-protesters threw water bottles at them.\n\nCollins is no stranger to accusations of racism. Earlier this year, he suggested murdering migrants by throwing them from helicopters into the sea, in the manner of U.S.-backed South American dictators in the 1970s.\n\nHe also introduced the Restricting Administration Zealots from Obliging Raiders (RAZOR) Act, which would ban the federal government from removing or altering \"any state-constructed barriers installed to mitigate illegal immigration,\" such as the razor buoys installed in the Rio Grande by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nCollins was also accused of antisemitism after he amplified an anti-semitic social media post by an avowed neo-Nazi targeting a Washington Post reporter for being Jewish.\n\nOle Miss said Friday that \"statements were made at the demonstration on our campus Thursday that were offensive and inappropriate.\"\n\n\"We cannot comment specifically about that video, but the university is looking into reports about specific actions,\" the school added. \"Any actions that violate university policy will be met with appropriate action.\"\n\nThe Ole Miss incident comes amid rapidly spreading campus protests across the U.S. and around the world in response to Israel's genocidal assault on Gaza, which has killed, maimed, or left missing around 5% of the embattled strip's 2.3 million people, most of them civilians, while forcibly displacing nearly 9 in 10 people and driving hundreds of thousands to the brink of starvation.\n\nWhile numerous Ole Miss students said they did not understand what the pro-Palestine protesters hoped to accomplish, others voiced support for the demonstrators -- and for Palestine.\n\n\"As we've seen throughout history, time and time again, the student movement is never wrong. Time and time again, anytime there's a student protest, and you're against it, you're on the wrong side of history,\" Xavier Black, a junior majoring in international studies, told The Daily Mississippian. \"So I would like to be on the right side.\"\n\nOne Palestinian American Ole Miss student was teary-eyed as she thanked the protesters.\n\n\"Hey guys, I know that what just happened was really intimidating, and it was a little scary, but I just want to say I'm so proud of you guys,\" the student -- who gave only her first name, Jana -- said, according toMississippi Today. \"This wasn't going to happen... without all of you guys. Palestine was being heard. And I just want to thank you guys so much.\"\n\n\"I know that was such a big risk, but this is the most that people have ever thought for us, so don't give up,\" she added. \"I know that was really hard, but we need to keep fighting.

Mike Collins wrote Friday on the social platform X with a with a link to the video showing the racist jeers.\n\nThe Associated Press left voicemail messages for Collins on Friday at his offices in Georgia and Washington and sent an email to his spokesperson, asking for an explanation of what Collins meant. There was no immediate response.\n\nThe taunting brought sharp criticism on and off campus.\n\n\"Students were calling for an end to genocide. They were met with racism,\" James M. Thomas, a sociology professor at the University of Mississippi, wrote Friday on X.\n\nThe Rev. Cornell William Brooks, a former president and CEO of the NAACP and professor at the John F.

According to a count by AP, more than 2,400 arrests have occurred on 46 U.S. university or college campuses since April 17 during demonstrations against the war.\n\nThe student newspaper, The Daily Mississippian, reported about 30 protesters on the Oxford campus billed themselves as UMiss for Palestine. Videos and photos from the event showed the protesters were in a grassy area near the main library, blocked off by barriers erected by campus security.\n\nThey chanted \"Free, free Palestine,\" and carried Palestinian flags and signs with slogans including, \"Stop the Genocide\" and \"U.S. bombs take Palestine lives.\"\n\nStudent journalist Stacey J. Spiehler shot video that showed campus police officers and the dean of students standing between anti-war protesters and hecklers. After the Black woman protesting the war had what appeared to be a heated exchange of words with several white hecklers, one of the men made the monkey gestures and noises at her.\n\nAbout 76% of the university's students were white and about 11% were Black in 2022-23, the most recent data available on the school's website.\n\nUniversity of Mississippi Chancellor Glenn Boyce said the school is committed to people expressing their views. He said some statements made on campus Thursday were \"offensive and unacceptable.\"\n\nRepublican Gov. Tate Reeves reposted a video on X that showed counter-protesters on the campus singing \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\n\"Warms my heart,\" Reeves wrote. \"I love Mississippi!\"\n\nUniversity of Mississippi student and counter-protester Connor Moore, center, taunts graduate student Jaylin R.

Spiehler, who explained that the counter-protester dressed in a pale blue t-shirt was jumping up and down, hooting like a monkey toward a protester who was live-streaming on her phone.\n\n\"It was easily 10-1 counter-protesters to protesters,\" Spiehler told The Independent. She said the woman, a student, stepped outside the protected barricade and was taking video on her phone.\n\nAs the woman approaches the group of male students, chants of \"lock her up\" could be heard.\n\n\"Counter-protesters were throwing things. I saw half a chicken parm sandwich on the ground, a carrot,\" Spiehler said. \"She was brave, holding her own and had more intelligence and empathy in her little finger than that whole crowd. Whether or not you agree with her, she embodies UM.\"\n\nThe video surfaced as ongoing pro-Palestinian protests at multiple college campus across the nation continue over the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIn a statement to The Independent on Friday, a spokesperson for Ole Miss wrote: \"Statements were made at the demonstration on our campus Thursday that were offensive and inappropriate. We cannot comment specifically about that video, but the university is looking into reports about specific actions. Any actions that violate university policy will be met with appropriate action.\"\n\nThe spokesperson declined to comment specifically about that video.\n\nIn an additional twist, Republican legislator Rep.

The counterprotesters were carrying flags supporting former President Donald Trump and shouted slogans that included \"f*** Joe Biden\" and \"who's your daddy.\"\n\nIn the viral video, the Black female student can be seen walking toward a group of white students as they appear to mock and film her.\n\nWhile the counterprotester who was accused of making racist gestures has not been identified, the student's fraternity confirmed in a statement on Sunday that he was removed from the organization.\n\n\"Phi Delta Theta General Headquarters is aware of the video regarding the student protest at the University of Mississippi,\" the statement reads. \"The racist actions in the video were those of an individual and are antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter.

Any actions that violate university policy will be met with appropriate action.\"\n\nThe racist video comes as heated pro-Palestinian protests erupt at college campuses across the United States. Pro-Palestinian protesters are demanding a ceasefire and calling on universities to divest from Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza.\n\nTensions at college campuses have continued to mount as the war drags on since the Palestinian militant group launched an October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that left 1,200 people dead. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its war in Gaza in response and over 76,000 people injured in the war-torn territory, according to the Associated Press, per the Gaza Health Ministry, which notes that at least two-thirds have been children and women.\n\nThe number of Palestinian deaths has ignited criticism and scrutiny from across the globe. Meanwhile, some campus demonstrations have turned disruptive and violent, prompting law enforcement intervention and causing top U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation. Recently, the House of Representatives approved the Antisemitism Awareness Act to address reports of rising antisemitism on college campuses amid allegations of Jewish students being targeted during campus protests.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maura_zurick@newsweek.com", "name": "Maura Zurick", "type": "author", "isAgency":

She's the \"body-positive\" pop star who recently performed at President Joe Biden's New York fundraiser with former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. The media on Saturday is all over a pro-America counter-protest at the University of Mississippi where a bunch of white frat boys taunted a large black woman who was part of the pro-Hamas encampment.\n\nThe protesters eventually had to be evacuated off campus as they were heavily outnumbered by the counter protesters.\n\nOnly 50 pro-Palestine protesters showed up. They were flooded by 200 counter-protestors according to the Clarion Ledger.\n\nVideos: @calicocutpant @RichardHanania\n\nOne of the frat boys is accused of making monkey noises, and this was cheered on by Rep. Mike Collins, who posted the video to his account Friday:\n\nThe Hill reports:\n\nPro-Palestine demonstrations at the University of Mississippi were overtaken with counter protesters Thursday, resulting in a viral clip of white students taunting a Black student. The video was shared online and applauded by a Republican lawmaker.\n\n\"Ole Miss taking care of business,\" Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) posted on social media platform X.\n\nThe video has received sharp criticism for the students' racist actions. Collins has also been criticized for endorsing the racist actions in the video.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Collins' team, asking for an explanation of what he meant when he posted the video.\n\nIn the clip, a white student appears to make monkey noises and gestures at a Black female graduate student.\n\nHold up, the student \"appears to make monkey noises\" and yet people are criticizing the video for the student's racist actions. So was it racist or not? The Left sure wants it to look that way. Maybe now President Biden will have something to say about the pro-Hamas encampments.\n\nAre you certain he was making monkey noises? That's racist. We'd be more upset if Georgetown Professor Zein El-Amine hadn't just called Rep. Byron Donalds a \"race traitor\" the other day. Why didn't that make the headlines?\n\nThat said, you also hear other kids / crowd chanting what sounds like generic \"hoo hoo hoo\" sports chanting. I would be very hesitant to immediately and potentially wrongfully jump on another Covington Kids situation based on this clip alone.\n\n\"Enjoy wearing the hat.\"\n\nThat was kind of our reaction. These groups have been chanting:\n\nHamas we love you\n\nAnd we love your rockets too\n\nShoot another soldier now\n\nBurn Tel Aviv to the ground\n\n... as well as physically blocking Jewish students from entering campuses. They're going to try to use this video to show the righteousness of pro-Hamas protesters by invoking Charlotteville.\n\nBut they'll make this kid the face of the pro-Israel movement. He'll be all over MSNBC. Meanwhile, pro-Hamas protesters have been calling for Israel to be wiped off the map and giving students armbands to allow them access to campus.\n\nIn the intersectionality view, the black woman supporting terrorists trumps the white man supporting America because white men and America and Israel are the oppressors.", "source": {"uri": "twitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twitchy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_t@twitchy.com", "name": "Brett T.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mississippi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Mississippi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lizzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clarion-Ledger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Clarion-Ledger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_(Germany)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Left (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Donalds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byron Donalds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_traitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race traitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intersectionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgetown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covington,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Covington, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Covington, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/115/e0dc625c-fd04-4d20-be6e-080f2c0f61b2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537774", "eventUri": "eng-9537774", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Mike Collins (R-GA) reposted a video of a student making monkey noises towards a Black woman, captioning it \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\"\n\nRoughly 25 student demonstrators took to the campus quad this week to protest the ongoing killings in Gaza, carrying Palestinian flags and signs reading \"Stop the Genocide.\" Amid \"free Palestine\" calls, hundreds of counter protestors showed up, throwing food and bottles and flipping off the pro-Palestinian gathering, with some reportedly waving Trump flags. Counter-demonstrators recited the national anthem and chanted \"lock her up,\" \"hit the showers,\" and a variety of racist remarks.\n\nIn the video reposted by the Georgia representative on X, formerly Twitter, a group of students in American flag apparel viciously boo and jeer at a Black demonstrator, including the student making monkey noises.

On the other side, counter-protesters gathered with American flags, according to CNN.\n\nAt one point, a graduate student later identified as Jaylin Smith, 24, left the main body of anti-Israel protesters to advance upon the counter-protesters, videoing them with her phone.\n\nAs she approached, video showed a student in American flag overalls retreating to the ranks of counter-protesters as he filmed her while she filmed him.\n\nAmid a vast ocean of hollering, the counter-protesters were heard exclaiming \"hoo-hoo-hoo,\" a noise that Smith and a legion of social media supporters refer to as \"monkey noises.\"\n\nThe video showed one student in particular appearing to dance and make the loudest monkey noises. The student appears at the far right of the frame at about 9 seconds into the video.\n\nAlthough multiple social media posts attacking the student claimed to identify the student, the Western Journal is withholding identification at this time.\n\n\"The monkey gestures -- and people calling me fat or Lizzo -- didn't hurt my feelings because I know what I am. I am so confident in my blackness. I am so confident in my size, in the way that I wear my hair, and who I am. They do not bother me. If anything, I felt pity for them for how stupidly they acted,\" Smith said.\n\n\"I said some insults back, too. I cursed like a sailor at them, and I regret letting them get to me like that,\" Smith said.\n\nOle Miss Chancellor Glenn F. Boyce said in a statement that college officials are \"aware that some statements made were offensive, hurtful and unacceptable, including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones\" and that at least one student conduct investigation has been opened.\n\nOther students may also be targeted, he said. The Ole Miss Associate Student Body also scolded anyone misbehaving at a protest in a statement on Facebook.\n\n\"Yesterday, we observed a demonstration on our campus -- a place for the expression of diverse viewpoints, protected by our constitutional First Amendment Rights. Yet, amidst this expression, unacceptable remarks were made that departed from our cherished values.\"\n\nSocial media, of course, got into the debate. After one poster referred to the student in question as a \"frat boy,\" famous race-baiter Jemele Hill posted her irate response on X.\n\n\"1) What fraternity does he represent? That fraternity's national leadership needs to be contacted immediately and that frat should be barred from campus. 2) We have recently seen endless conversations and action items created about antisemitism, but I'm guessing that same energy won't be there to protect this open hostility directed at Black students,\" she posted.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Collins of Georgia offered a differing view by posting a video of the incident on X and writing, \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\"\n\nInfuriated, the NAACP sent a letter to congressional leaders regarding Collins' post, which said, \"These actions conducted by a member of the House of Representatives, regardless of intent, legitimize and propagate racism and undermine the principles of equality and justice that our government is sworn to uphold,\" CNN reported.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_davis@westernjournal.com", "name": "Jack Davis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monkey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Miss_Rebels_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ole Miss Rebels football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_of_passage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rite of passage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lizzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Collins (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemele_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jemele Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.westernjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ole-Miss-Protest.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537774", "eventUri": "eng-9537774", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

And it was never clear exactly how stinking up a few random quads, and holding out for \"humanitarian aid\" in the form of a Chipotle burrito bowl, was ever going to affect what's happening in the Middle East.\n\nOf course, the whole operation, as I've outlined previously, was never even about Gaza or Israel in any way. Instead, it's about repackaging anti-white hatred into yet another astro-turfed national campaign of riots and civil disorder, just in time for the presidential election. So at some point, it stood to reason, these kids would stop pretending to care about the war in Gaza altogether. They'd drop the act and move to something else.\n\nOver the weekend, as if on cue, the pivot took place.\n\nAll at once, on campuses and inside newsrooms all over the country, Left-wing outrage over the Middle East subsided. And it was replaced with abject horror concerning a new, supposedly far greater crime against humanity. This act of pure, unadulterated evil took place, if you can believe it, on the campus of the University of Mississippi. And it was all recorded on video.\n\nIf there are children in the room, avert their eyes. If you have a sensitive stomach, turn away now. This is footage of the atrocity that was caught live, on camera. Brace yourself:\n\nIf you're anything like me, you probably missed the part of that footage you're supposed to be angry about. For such a supposedly earth-shattering event, it's tough to spot.\n\nInstead, what you see is a bunch of frat bros who probably aren't even that political. They're probably just tired of the narcissistic and highly fragrant Leftists who have been defiling their campus. They're pro-America more than anything else. The American flag overalls are a pretty big clue there. Beyond those overalls, what's the big deal, you might ask?\n\nLeave it to the crack reporting team of the Mississippi Free Press to explain why exactly we should be outraged. As one of that papers' reporters put it, quote: \"A white Ole Miss frat boy dances like a monkey and makes monkey noises near a Black woman who was protesting for Palestine.\"\n\nIf you go back and look at the tape, and focus entirely on the right-hand side of your screen, you'll see about two seconds of a student jumping up and down while flailing his arms and making a face. We're supposed to conclude that this student was \"dancing like a monkey\" and therefore was insinuating that black people are like monkeys. And in turn, we're supposed to be extremely outraged by this.\n\nThere are a lot of logical leaps here, which I'll get to in a second. The path from normal to outraged requires you to jump across five different widely spaced Lilly pads. But first, it's important to understand that this was the unanimous reaction from the Left. Even as a supposed \"genocide\" is going on in the Middle East, this is what they've now decided to hyperventilate over.\n\nJemele Hill got the lynch mob started. She wrote: \"What fraternity does he represent? That fraternity's national leadership needs to be contacted immediately and that frat should be barred from campus.\"\n\nCNN, NPR, Newsweek, the Associated Press and pretty much every other outlet published self-serious pieces about this supposedly racist \"confrontation.\" A former DNC field director named Adam Parkhomenko wrote that this incident is yet more proof that America is a \"racist country.\" The NAACP chapter at Ole Miss bemoaned the \"abhorrent but also entirely unacceptable\" and \"deeply disheartening\" behavior in the footage.\n\nThe Guardian reported that \"some said\" that Mississippi's governor reminded them of a \"segregationist\" because he put out a tweet praising the students in the video. The Daily Beast called the clip \"gross.\" Left-wing lobbyist Nina Turner wrote: \"This is a video showing anti-Blackness.\" Turner also scolded Congressman Mike Collins, who had praised the students in the video: \"Representative, that is a white man making monkey gestures at a Black woman. And these protesters are NOT terrorists. Don't play games. Check yourself.\"\n\nTo be clear, it's not just commentators on the Left who are saying things like this. Some conservative pundits joined in as well. For example, Rob Smith wrote: \"The Ole Miss incident was incredibly racist. I don't care what 'influencers' say or post, I care what elected officials do. @RepMikeCollins is an absolute clown for posting what he posted. I said what I said. Cry more.\"\n\nFormer RNC chairman Michael Steele agreed: \"@RepMikeCollins this is not 'taking care of business'; and if you think it is, exactly what is the business you are referring to? Your casual approval of racist behavior and the need you seemingly feel to brag about it is an abject failure of your leadership as a member of the United States Congress and not a proud moment for you or #OleMiss.\"\n\nSo, this is yet another moment where several commentators on the Right join in with the outrage mob on the Left, which is something that never happens the other way around. And in response to this outrage from all sides, the student's fraternity, Phi Delta Theta, has kicked him out. Ole Miss has opened a \"student conduct investigation,\" which sounds ominous. Instead of everyone just ignoring this episode and moving on, because there's about ten million more important things happening, it's following the standard cancellation template from 2020. This student's being doxxed online and threatened. His picture is all over. Organizations are cutting ties. You know the drill.\n\nThe other familiar part of this story is that, once again, the mob is claiming that out-of-context video footage tells us everything we need to know about the particular incident. But as a basic factual matter, it's not even clear that this student was making monkey noises. Again, he's featured in the video for something like 1.2 seconds. I never noticed the \"monkey noises\" until everyone pointed it out. Without that prompting, I'm not sure I ever would have interpreted it that way.\n\nMore to the point, there's something funny and ironically racist about Leftists always trying to connect monkey noises to black people. This is a recurring theme, and you have to wonder why that is.\n\nThey did the same thing in late 2022 when someone allegedly made monkey noises at a girls' high school volleyball game in Texas. You probably don't remember that whole debacle, because the narrative was embarrassing for everyone involved and the media immediately dropped it.\n\nSo to refresh your memory, here's the allegedly racist footage, which was uploaded by a mother in the stands.\n\nWatch and listen, and see if you can detect the monkey noises here:\n\nYou'll notice that no one in the stands or on the court reacted in any way to these allegedly racist monkey noises. In fact, not even the players who were supposedly being targeted by these chants reacted. It was only after this woman got home and uploaded this footage, saying she heard a racist monkey chant, that some sort of investigation was launched by the school district. The story fizzled though, because if you listen to that footage, it's not remotely clear what this woman is talking about. People do all kinds of chants at sporting events and they make all kinds of noises for all kinds of different reasons.\n\nSo for all we know, that's what's happening at Ole Miss. Maybe this frat kid saw a large, irate woman intentionally antagonizing him (and all of his friends). And maybe he decided to jump up and down to yell and mock her -- not because she's black, but because she's being antagonizing and annoying. It's even possible he had no animus towards this woman whatsoever. After all, during this same interaction, the frat bros also referred to this large black protester as \"Lizzo.\" And as we've been told relentlessly, Lizzo is the paragon of female beauty. All women should aspire to look and act like Lizzo. So maybe in this instance, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. Who knows.\n\nBut here's the important point. Even if this student did what they accuse him of -- even if he was imitating this Lizzo look-alike in a disparaging way -- then at worst, he's guilty of making an inappropriate joke. You can call it racist or bigoted if you want to feel more oppressed. It doesn't matter. Whatever you call it, this is not the sort of thing that a kid should have his life destroyed over. There are much worse sins than engaging in a mocking dance for two seconds, no matter how \"bigoted\" that dance might allegedly be. And the response to this student should reflect that.\n\nIn fact, at a public university like Ole Miss, it's also not clear that the school has any right to punish him at all. The First Amendment allows students at public universities to exercise their right to freedom of speech -- which includes speech that many people find bigoted or offensive.\n\nThere's been a lot of that kind of speech on college campuses in the last few weeks, if you haven't noticed. And there's no argument that this Ole Miss incident is somehow uniquely offensive and horrible, because pretty much every day, college kids are caught on camera doing something far worse than this.\n\nThe pro-Palestine protesters have said plenty of vile things. One activist held up a sign at Columbia saying Jewish students should be Hamas' \"next target.\"\n\nSomeone just yelled \"Kill the Jews\" at a rally at Northeastern University the other day. It's not clear who exactly said that, but you'd think there'd be some proportional amount of interest in answering that question. And of course, there's systematic anti-white and anti-Asian bias at all of these schools, in both admissions and hiring. And that impacts a lot more lives than whatever this frat boy was doing for two seconds.\n\nSo if we're going to destroy this one kid's life over this two-second dance, then we should also expel all of these protesters and fire every administrator in every one of these schools. Until we do that, then no one should even pretend to care about this one Ole Miss frat boy being \"bigoted\" or whatever. It's so disingenuous it's actually nauseating.\n\nThis is a point that goes without saying, but if this was a black student making racist statements and gestures at a white frat boy, none of these people would give a damn. The outrage mob would either ignore it or outright defend it. We know that's the case because they don't give a damn when white people are beaten to a pulp on camera.\n\nFor example, here's a story that precisely no one on the Left cares about. Remember the black guy in Brooklyn who was arrested for sucker punching a 57-year-old white woman in the face, breaking her jaw? He's reportedly a habitual offender who's done this several times. Here's that footage:\n\nIt's another \"random, unprovoked attack.\" They just assume that none of these videos of black people punching white people can possibly be racially motivated. They're all just random. The frat kid's dance is immediately determined to be racist, but a black person going around punching white people is just acting \"randomly.\" Well maybe the monkey noises -- if they were monkey noises -- were also random. Random things happen all the time, apparently.\n\nAnyway, that assault happened in March. What happened next?\n\nIn a rare move in New York, prosecutors upgraded this guy's charges to a felony. They also wanted to put him in jail before trial. But the judge overseeing this case, Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Matthew Sciarrino, rejected the prosecutors' bail request. So he's back out on the street where he can punch more white women. And if you have a problem with that, you should know that the judge doesn't care. He just retired to Florida. That's not an exaggeration. The judge has left the state. He's fled the hellhole of New York -- which he helped turn into a hellhole -- for a state that actually enforces laws.\n\nI could give about a million more examples of anti-white violence that's not simply tolerated, but endorsed by the most powerful institutions in this country. And none of it gets a fraction of the attention of one white student doing a dance for two seconds at Ole Miss. But I don't need to go through all of these examples because it's not 2020 anymore. There's no excuse for anyone on the Right to fail to recognize what's going on here. When one side is allowed to commit racial violence with impunity, while the Lynch mob assembles to punish the other side for mockery and jokes, that's a pretty big clue that no one really cares about the mockery and jokes. It's all a power play. Unless conservatives want a beat-for-beat replay of 2020, which is clearly what the Left wants at this point, then it's well past time we stopped pretending otherwise.", "source": {"uri":

Boyce sent a letter to students and staff on Friday noting that Ole Miss leaders were aware of behaviors that were \"offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable, including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones\" at Thursday's protest.\n\n\"While student privacy laws prohibit us from commenting on any specific student, we have opened one student conduct investigation,\" Boyce wrote. \"We are working to determine whether more cases are warranted.\"\n\nOn Thursday, a group of roughly 30 to 60 pro-Palestinian protestors gathered on the Quad and added to the list of demonstrations on college campuses nationwide. But the event turned hostile as they were outnumbered by counter protesters, who at one point drowned out the chants of protesters by singing \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\nVideos of the event circulated online, many noting that the pro-Palestinian demonstrators appeared to be a multi-racial group but were surrounded by a mostly white group of counter protesters taunting them.\n\nOne confrontation drew particular offense, in which a Black female graduate student on the protest side of a barricade went up to two young men to record the group them as they yelled in her direction.\n\nIn the corner of one widely-shared video, a man can be seen jumping up and down and appearing to make a noise to simulate an ape at the woman.\n\nOther members of the group yelled \"Lizzo\" and \"Lock her up\" at the woman, who was guided away by police.\n\nThe university's Black Student Union released a statement in solidarity with the pro-Palestinian group, who them described as \"nonviolent demonstrators who were advocating for Palestine,\" according to The Daily Mississippian.\n\n\"The students were exercising their right under the First Amendment, while the counter-protesters were present with malicious intent as well as a prominent lack of knowledge on the situation at hand,\" the statement posted to Instagram said.\n\nCommenters online condemned the incident, drawing the racist overtones of the interaction to the long history of racial animus and violence in Mississippi.\n\nMore than 100 years ago, the state's senators voted to send all of its Black people back to Africa. When the university was ordered by a federal court to admit Black students in 1962, 2,000 white people rioted against the arrival of new student James Meredith.\n\nAnd despite being located in a state with one of the highest population of Black residents, only 11.4 percent of the University of Mississippi student body is Black.\n\nBoyce's message on Friday acknowledged both student and faculty's rights to free speech and peaceful assembly under the First Amendment, but singled out behaviors that demeaned people \"because of their race or ethnicity\" as contrary to the school's values. He added that it is \"important to acknowledge our challenging history, and incidents like this can set us back.\"\n\n\"It is one reason why we do not take this lightly and cannot let the unacceptable behavior of a few speak for our institution or define us,\" Boyce said. \"We are a community of scholars committed to creating an academic experience that respects the dignity of each individual.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mississippi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Mississippi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Mississippian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Mississippian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lizzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students'_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Students' union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Star-Spangled Banner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Meredith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Meredith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240503-university-of-mississippi-mn-1515-8ebf8e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537774", "eventUri": "eng-9537774", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Smith, 24, confirmed to CNN she is the woman seen in the video.\n\n\"One thing that will never break me is people taunting me or making monkey noises at me,\" the journalism and new media graduate student told CNN on Friday.\n\nThe video viewed by CNN shows a large group of counterprotesters yelling at Smith as she walks toward them while holding her phone. Law enforcement appeared to be telling her to \"go back\" to where other pro-Palestinian protesters were rallying. Smith is heard in the video saying, \"I'm not so peaceful\" repeatedly as police usher her away from the counterprotesters.\n\nCNN has been unable to identify any of the counterprotesters seen in the video.\n\nA letter from Chancellor Glenn F. Boyce says university officials are \"aware that some statements made were offensive, hurtful and unacceptable, including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones\" and that at least one student conduct investigation has been opened.\n\nThe Chancellor noted that the university is determining if any additional investigations are necessary.\n\nUS Representative Mike Collins, a Republican representing parts of Georgia, shared the viral video on X saying, \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\" CNN has reached out to Collins' office.\n\nThe NAACP sent a letter to congressional leadership Saturday asking for an investigation into Collins' conduct. \"These actions conducted by a member of the House of Representatives, regardless of intent, legitimize and propagate racism and undermine the principles of equality and justice that our government is sworn to uphold,\" the letter shared exclusively with CNN says in part.\n\nSmith said at the protest, Pro-Palestinian demonstrators were kept in an enclosure, which police said was for their safety. She told CNN she briefly stepped out of the enclosure to go live on social media, and that was when the confrontation took place.\n\n\"I said some insults back, too. I cursed like a sailor at them, and I regret letting them get to me like that,\" Smith said.\n\n\"The monkey gestures - and people calling me fat or Lizzo - didn't hurt my feelings, because I know what I am. I am so confident in my Blackness. I am so confident in my size, in the way that I wear my hair, and who I am. They do not bother me. If anything, I felt pity for them for how stupidly they acted,\" Smith added.\n\nThe university's Chancellor alluded to the \"racist overtones\" of the confrontation and the University of Mississippi has a long history of racial incidents, including the deadly riots that broke out there in 1962 when James Meredith became the first Black student to enroll at the school.\n\n\"Yesterday, we observed a demonstration on our campus -- a place for the expression of diverse viewpoints, protected by our constitutional First Amendment Rights,\" the Ole Miss Associate Student Body said in part in a statement on Friday, \"Yet, amidst this expression, unacceptable remarks were made that departed from our cherished values.\"\n\nSmith said she is disappointed the confrontation has become the topic of conversation now, rather than a ceasefire in Gaza. She told CNN the graduate school dean and a few other school administrators have reached out to her since the video went viral. She is currently preparing to graduate on May 11.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Will his corporate backers stand by him?", "body": "On Thursday, Jaylin Smith, a graduate student at the University of Mississippi, participated in a small, non-violent protest calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Smith and the other protesters were greeted by a much larger group of counterprotesters throwing cups of ice water and chanting, \"fuck Joe Biden\" and \"take a shower.\"\n\nIn a video posted to X Thursday evening by journalist Stacey Spiehler, the counterprotesters are shown aggressively taunting Smith. One student counterprotester is mocking Smith, who is Black, by imitating a monkey.\n\n\"At a university which promotes diversity, equity and inclusivity, I'm standing for my right to free speech and getting things thrown at me,\" Smith told the Mississippi Free Press. \"It takes our white, our Black, our Brown, our Asian students to stand up for everybody. Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.\"\n\nSpiehler's video was reposted by Richard Hanania, who has written \"articles for white supremacist publications under a pseudonym\" in which he \"expressed support for eugenics\" and opposed \"race mixing.\" Hanania stopped writing for those publications but now \"makes explicitly racist statements and arguments\" under his real name. On X, Hanania described the video with the monkey imitation as \"beautiful,\" praising the men for \"mocking the Hamas loving fat girl.\" (In another video, protesters can be heard screaming \"fuck you fatass\" and \"fuck you bitch\" at Smith.)\n\nCongressman Mike Collins (R-GA) then reposted Hanania's video. \"Ole Miss taking care of business,\" Collins remarked.\n\nCollins' endorsement of the racist taunting of Smith quickly received national media attention. In a statement, University of Mississippi Chancellor Glenn Boyce condemned the conduct of counterprotesters, calling it \"offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable, including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones.\" Phi Delta Theta fraternity announced it kicked out the student who imitated a monkey in the video, asserting that his \"racist actions\" were \"antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta.\"\n\nCollins, meanwhile, has not responded to requests for comment from the Associated Press -- or Popular Information -- even as he continues to post on X about other topics. Three days later, the video and Collins' endorsement of the counterprotesters remain on Collins' account.\n\nThis is not the first time Collins has been engaged in bigoted commentary on social media. In March, Collins participated in a vehemently anti-Semitic attack against a Washington Post journalist on X. Collins endorsed a post by a racist meme account, @GarbageHuman23, who attacked journalist Maura Judkis for being Jewish. @GarbageHuman23 also frequently posts bigoted memes about Black people, LGBTQ people, and others.\n\nCollins, who was first elected to Congress in 2022, bills himself a pro-Trump outsider. But, in his reelection campaign, Collins has attracted the financial support of many of the country's most prominent corporations. Now that Collins has unapologetically endorsed racism, will these corporations maintain their support for Collins?\n\nCoca-Cola's corporate website says there is \"no place in our world for racism\" and Coca-Cola has \"a duty to strive for greater justice and equity within our own company and throughout society.\" Specifically, Coca-Cola announced in November 2020, as part of its \"racial equality plan,\" that it would donate nothing from its corporate PAC to \"candidates who make egregious or inflammatory remarks in the equality and inclusion area.\"\n\nCoca-Cola's PAC donated $2,500 to Collins' reelection on June 6, 2023, and another $2,500 to October 13, 2023. Popular Information asked the company if it would seek a refund from Collins in light of his inflammatory remarks about the protest at the University of Mississippi. Coca-Cola did not respond.\n\nIn an April 2023 press release, Verizon stated that it remains \"steadfast in our commitment to a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion both within our own company and in the communities we serve.\" In Verizon's 2022 proxy statement, the company touted its support for \"social and racial justice.\" In a 2021 tweet, Verizon said it stands \"with the Black community to create a better tomorrow.\"\n\nOn January 31, 2024, Verizon's PAC donated $1,000 to support Collins' reelection. Popular Information contacted Verizon and asked if it would continue to support Collins' in light of his commentary regarding the protest at the University of Mississippi. Verizon did not respond.\n\nIn June 2020, Delta CEO Ed Bastian released a memo stating, \"we need to do better as a nation and as a society to take on racial inequality and injustice.\" Bastain added that Delta also needed \"to do better as a company.\" In the memo, Bastain said he understood there was skepticism about his commitment to these issues because \"[p]romises have been made and forgotten many times throughout our history.\" In February 2021, Delta said it was committed to becoming an \"anti-racist, anti-discrimination organization\" and that it wanted to \"be held accountable for achieving these goals.\" In October 2023, Delta touted its support for \"racial justice and public education efforts.\"\n\nDelta's corporate PAC donated $2,500 to Collins on December 12, 2023. Asked whether Delta would continue to financially support Collins' reelection in light of its professed support for racial justice, the company did not respond.\n\nIn May 2020, AT&T decried the \"racism faced by Black people in America today\" and pledged its advocacy for \"equality and inclusion\" will continue \"for the future.\" In June 2020, the company tweeted that \"[s]ilence is no longer an option\" and people must \"stand unapologetically for equality and justice, and firmly against systemic racism.\" In March 2021, the company said it \"stand[s] firm for equality and remain committed to doing our part to advance racial equity and justice for all.\" AT&T said it has been \"at the forefront of civil rights advocacy and the fight for equality\" since the 1960s.\n\nAT&T's PAC donated $1,000 to Collins' reelection campaign on April 19, 2023. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOther corporations that made PAC contributions to Collins' reelection include American Airlines, Boeing, Cox Enterprises, Goodyear, Home Depot, Southwest Airlines, T-Mobile, and UPS. Those companies did not respond to a request for comment about Collins' remarks and their support for his reelection campaign.", "source": {"uri": "popular.info", "dataType": "news", "title":

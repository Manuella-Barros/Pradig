They \"wanted to get arrested,\" she added.\n\nShe noted that the school had offered the protesters rooms to use 24 hours a day but the response of the student organizers was to \"keep the tents up to get arrested.\"\n\nThe mayor's no-nonsense response contrasted sharply with that of Emerson College president Jay Bernhardt, who has assured the protesters he \"could feel the pain.\"\n\nHis approach has won him little love among the student population, judging from recent meetings.\n\nMany students called on the president to resign at a town hall meeting held on April 29, which centered around events leading up to the April 25 arrest of 118 students by the Boston Police Department. Police acted after protesters at the \"Popular University Encampment\" at 2 Boylston Place Alley refused to vacate the public street.\n\nStudent calls for the president's resignation echoed a Student Government Association general assembly meeting on April 26, when students unanimously voted no-confidence in Bernhardt, who is Jewish, demanding he resign.\n\n\"Get him out,\" some chanted, according to the school's student newspaper, The Berkeley Beacon.\n\nBernhardt, who retains the support of Emerson's Board of Trustees, has continued his placatory approach. In a campus-wide email on the Monday after the town hall meeting, Bernhardt wrote: \"As I listened to the 100-plus stories, passions ran high, and I could feel the pain expressed by those arrested, those who cared for them, and those who were adversely affected by the encampment.\n\n\"I certainly heard and now better understand the pain these recent experiences have caused our community. I deeply regret that despite our best efforts, our students' activism resulted in police action over their encampment, especially in the heartbreaking way it occurred,\" he wrote.\n\nWhat \"heartbreaking way\" the police acted is unclear. Boston police gave students fair warning to leave the area. Bodycam footage shows an officer cautioning students on April 25 at about 1:30 a.m.\n\n\"We don't want to arrest anybody. We support your right to protest. I'm indifferent. OK? I don't have a side either way. I want you to be able to peacefully do this. However, with a popular street, I can't have that. I need you to open up. Leave it open. Otherwise, I have to uproot you from there,\" the officer said.\n\nNo students were hurt during the operation, though four officers were injured, one seriously, the police said.\n\nStudents disputed the police account at the Student Government Association and town hall meetings.\n\nAt the Student Government Association event, students took turns at the microphone describing in high-strung tones how they \"watched our friends bleed.\"\n\n\"I will never forget being able to see fluorescent yellow through the umbrella I was holding,\" said one.\n\n\"Why is it so hard for not just the people here and our politicians and our fellow human beings to care about other human beings?\" said another.\n\n\"It was an incredible escalation of violence, but I'm so proud of our community for showing up today,\" said Nandan Nair, incoming executive president of the Student Government Association.\n\nStudents at the town hall expressed anger at the press for not reporting their version of events. \"To the media, [we] will not forget the lies you distributed and the woeful failure of your journalism,\" a student said.\n\n\"What happened on that day was completely unconstitutional,\" said a student joining via Zoom. \"Class [action suit] should be started.\"\n\n\"I got charged with trespassing on my college,\" said one indignant student. (Police noted that 2 Boylston Place Alley is not owned by Emerson College and the protesters were violating city ordinances.)\n\nStudents mainly held Bernhardt responsible for the encampment's dismantlement and for not ceding to their demands.\n\n\"Show us action. Show us anything. You have already failed us,\" said a student at the town hall. \"But if you cannot respect us enough to concede to our demands and resign, then prove yourself. We are waiting. We are watching, history is watching, history will remember where you stand.\"\n\nProtesting students demand Emerson call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, disclose all financial investments, and divest from entities supporting Israel.\n\nThey also insist that all disciplinary charges be dropped against the organizers, a demand Bernhardt met, announcing in an email to Emersonians last week that the college wouldn't bring \"any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.\"\n\n'The most extreme voices'\n\nHe also revealed the school had sent staff to police precincts and posted bail for \"arrested students, canceling and modifying classes so our community could process what had occurred, and providing additional care and support for our community to heal.\"\n\nBernhardt's decision brought criticism from Anti-Defamation League CEO and national director Jonathan Greenblatt.\n\n\"The president of Emerson is going out of his way to make sure students who broke the law and violated Emerson's own policies face no consequences,\" Greenblatt said. \"This capitulates to the most extreme voices and rewards their disruptive conduct.\"\n\nThe ADL called on Bernhardt to reverse his decision and \"urges the Suffolk District Attorney to enforce the law.\"\n\nAlthough similar encampments at other schools have been rife with antisemitism, Emerson's protesters insisted theirs was different.\n\n\"I have not heard one utterance of anti-Jewish hate speech. That's just not what we do,\" Owen Buxton, a member of Emerson's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, told The Boston Globe in a video on YouTube, even as he called for a boycott of \"all Zionist entities.\"\n\nLater in the video, protesters chanted, \"Palestine will be free. From the sea to the river,\" generally regarded as a genocidal call for Israel's destruction.\n\nEmerson student Roni Moser, 19, a freshman from Israel, who said that her parents warned her not to speak Hebrew or tell anyone she was Israeli, nevertheless spoke out, taking the podium at a pro-Israel rally in Boston on April 28.\n\nShe described a situation in which Jewish students were intimidated, \"to the point where many had to be removed from campus and temporarily placed in hotels.\"\n\n\"Friends of mine were called terrorists, were compared to the KKK and were harassed and offended for believing Israel has the right to exist,\" Moser said.\n\n\"People have the right to protest, and people have the right to protest things we don't necessarily agree with. People shouldn't and don't have the right to use such violent and antisemitic speech.\"\n\nExamples of hateful speech Moser provided: \"Long live the intifada,\" \"Israel is antisemitic,\" \"From the river to the sea\" and \"F*** Zionists.\"", "source": {"uri": "tjpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Texas Jewish Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sharon_wisch_ray@tjpnews.com", "name": "Sharon

They \"wanted to get arrested,\" she added.\n\nShe noted that the school had offered the protesters rooms to use 24 hours a day but the response of the student organizers was to \"keep the tents up to get arrested.\"\n\nThe mayor's no-nonsense response contrasted sharply with that of Emerson College President Jay Bernhardt, who has assured the protesters he \"could feel the pain.\"\n\nHis approach has won him little love among the student population, judging from recent meetings.\n\nMany students called on the president to resign at a town hall meeting held on April 29, which centered around events leading up to the April 25 arrest of 118 students by the Boston Police Department. Police acted after protesters at the \"Popular University Encampment\" at 2 Boylston Place Alley refused to vacate the public street.\n\nStudent calls for the president's resignation echoed a Student Government Association general assembly meeting on April 26, when students unanimously voted no-confidence in Bernhardt, who is Jewish, demanding he resign.\n\n\"Get him out,\" some chanted, student newspaper The Berkeley Beacon, reported.\n\nBernhardt, who retains the support of Emerson's Board of Trustees, has continued his placatory approach. In a campus-wide email on the Monday after the town hall meeting, Bernhardt wrote: \"As I listened to the 100-plus stories, passions ran high, and I could feel the pain expressed by those arrested, those who cared for them, and those who were adversely affected by the encampment.\n\n\"I certainly heard and now better understand the pain these recent experiences have caused our community. I deeply regret that despite our best efforts, our students' activism resulted in police action over their encampment, especially in the heartbreaking way it occurred,\" he wrote.\n\nWhat \"heartbreaking way\" the police acted is unclear. Boston police gave students fair warning to leave the area. Bodycam footage shows an officer cautioning students on April 25 at about 1:30 a.m.\n\n\"We don't want to arrest anybody. We support your right to protest. I'm indifferent. OK? I don't have a side either way. I want you to be able to peacefully do this. However, with a popular street I can't have that. I need you to open up. Leave it open. Otherwise, I have to uproot you from there,\" the officer said.\n\nNo students were hurt during the operation, though four officers were injured, one seriously, the police said.\n\nStudents disputed the police account at the Student Government Association and town hall meetings.\n\nAt the Student Government Association event, students took turns at the microphone describing in high-strung tones how they \"watched our friends bleed.\"\n\n\"I will never forget being able to see fluorescent yellow through the umbrella I was holding,\" said one.\n\n\"Why is it so hard for not just the people here and our politicians and our fellow human beings to care about other human beings?\" said another.\n\n\"It was an incredible escalation of violence, but I'm so proud of our community for showing up today,\" said Nandan Nair, incoming executive president of the Student Government Association.\n\nStudents at the town hall expressed anger at the press for not reporting their version of events. \"To the media, [we] will not forget the lies you distributed and the woeful failure of your journalism,\" a student said.\n\n\"What happened on that day was completely unconstitutional,\" said a student joining via Zoom. \"Class [action suit] should be started.\"\n\n\"I got charged with trespassing on my college,\" said one indignant student. (Police noted that 2 Boylston Place Alley is not owned by Emerson College and the protesters were violating city ordinances.)\n\nStudents mainly held Bernhardt responsible for the encampment's dismantlement and for not ceding to their demands.\n\n\"Show us action. Show us anything. You have already failed us,\" said a student at the town hall. \"But if you cannot respect us enough to concede to our demands and resign, then prove yourself. We are waiting. We are watching, history is watching, history will remember where you stand.\"\n\nProtesting students demand Emerson call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, disclose all financial investments, and divest from entities supporting Israel.\n\nThey also insist that all disciplinary charges be dropped against the organizers, a demand Bernhardt met, announcing in an email to Emersonians last week that the college wouldn't bring \"any campus disciplinary charges against the protestors and will encourage the district attorney not to pursue charges related to encampment violations.\"\n\nHe also revealed the school had sent staff to police precincts and posted bail for \"arrested students, canceling and modifying classes so our community could process what had occurred, and providing additional care and support for our community to heal.\"\n\nBernhardt's decision brought criticism from Anti-Defamation League head Jonathan Greenblatt.\n\n\"The president of Emerson is going out of his way to make sure students who broke the law and violated Emerson's own policies face no consequences,\" Greenblatt said. \"This capitulates to the most extreme voices and rewards their disruptive conduct.\"\n\nThe ADL called on Bernhardt to reverse his decision and \"urges the Suffolk District Attorney to enforce the law.\"\n\nAlthough similar encampments at other schools have been rife with antisemitism, Emerson's protesters insisted theirs was different.\n\n\"I have not heard one utterance of anti-Jewish hate speech. That's just not what we do,\" Owen Buxton, a member of Emerson's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), told The Boston Globe in a video on YouTube, even as he called for a boycott of \"all Zionist entities.\"\n\nLater in the video, protesters chanted, \"Palestine will be free. From the sea to the river,\" generally regarded as a genocidal call for Israel's destruction.\n\nEmerson student Roni Moser, 19, a freshman from Israel, who said that her parents warned her not to speak Hebrew or tell anyone she was Israeli, nevertheless spoke out, taking the podium at a pro-Israel rally in Boston on April 28.\n\nShe described a situation in which Jewish students were intimidated, \"to the point where many had to be removed from campus and temporarily placed in hotels.\"\n\n\"Friends of mine were called terrorists, were compared to the KKK and were harassed and offended for believing Israel has the right to exist,\" Moser said.\n\n\"People have the right to protest, and people have the right to protest things we don't necessarily agree with. People shouldn't and don't have the right to use such violent and antisemitic speech.\"\n\nExamples of hateful speech Moser provided: \"Long live the intifada,\" \"Israel is antisemitic,\" \"From the river to the sea\" and \"F*** Zionists.\"", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News Syndicate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_isaac@jns.org", "name": "David Isaac",

Footage of the protests has shown demonstrators chanting in support of Hamas, calling for the destruction of Israel, and even threatening to harm members of the Jewish community on campus. In many cases, activists have also lambasted the US and Western civilization more broadly.\n\nAt Emerson College, the administration has accommodated protesters, going as far as dispatching staff \"to all precincts\" to bail out those whom police have arrested for trespassing -- according to a statement issued by President Jay Bernhardt. Emerson has also asked the local district attorney not to try their cases and will give free housing to protesters \"required to stay in town for court appearances,\" where they will live following the conclusion of the academic year.\n\n\"The president of Emerson is going out of his way to make sure students who broke the law and violated Emerson's own policies face no consequences,\" ADL chief executive officer Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. \"This capitulates to the most extreme voices and rewards their disruptive conduct. The Emerson community deserves better. ADL calls upon the president of Emerson to reverse this decision and urges the Suffolk District Attorney to enforce the law.\"\n\nPressure for granting protesters \"amnesty\" is building at the University Massachusetts Amherst, where the student government recently passed a resolution condemning the school for requesting police assistance in demonstrations there, an action which resulted in over 50 arrests. The student government is also demanding the university adopt the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement, a measure which could purge Jews and Zionists from the American academy, experts have told The Algemeiner.\n\nEmerson College is not the first school to excuse the behavior of pro-Hamas protesters.\n\nThe University of California, Riverside (UC Riverside) has made major concessions to anti-Israel protesters in exchange for the termination of their anti-Zionist demonstrations on campus, continuing a gradual normalization of the BDS movement against Israel.\n\nDetails of the settlement were disclosed by the university on Friday. It includes shuttering UC Riverside School of Business \"global programs\" in Israel -- as well as the US, Brazil, Jordan, Egypt, Vietnam, China, and Cuba -- appointing potentially anti-Zionist students to a task force on the university's endowment, and exploring the possibility of banning Sabra Hummus, which is co-owned by the Israeli food manufacturer Strauss Group, from campus.\n\nUC Riverside's apparent capitulation followed a precedent set by Northwestern University last week, when the school announced the establishment of a new scholarship for Palestinian students and an investment committee in which anti-Zionists students and faculty may wield an outsized voice.\n\nBrown University has also yielded to anti-Israel protesters, promising to hold a vote on divesting from companies linked to Israel.\n\nEvergreen State College in Olympia, Washington agreed to divest from companies linked to Israel, according to a \"Memorandum of Understanding Between the Evergreen State College and the Evergreen Gaza Solidarity Encampment,\" which the school posted on its website. Per the agreement, the school will issue a statement dictated by the protesters. The statement, a portion of which includes pro-Hamas propaganda, will \"be reviewed by negotiators and a faculty representative before it is released.\"", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com",

An impression from the eyewitness accounts was that, in the matter of the encampment erected in a downtown alley to protest Israel's military campaign in Gaza, Bernhardt's actions were in response to concerns over antisemitic statements and public safety issues. Yet, his actions -- or inactions -- were seen by many to escalate tensions rather than defuse them.\n\nSpeakers raised questions about the proportionality of the police response, noting that unarmed campus security had the scene under control. In addition, by relying on city and state police, officials exposed a significant number of staff, faculty, and students of color to rough handling. The exposure was detailed in eyewitness testimony and supported in the demand of the Emerson staff union for an independent and thorough inquiry. In taking a vote of \"no confidence,\" students reached the conclusion that Bernhardt has shown a failure of presidential leadership that cannot be rehabilitated.\n\nA most telling moment during the assembly was the hostile language of Eric Alexander, chair of the Emerson board. It involved a Black student speaking about the experience of policing in Boston. When the student pulled a can of spray paint out of his backpack, Alexander, seated next to Bernhardt a few rows away, yelled, \"Back the [expletive] up,\" as the young man approached. The image of an older white man shouting down a Black student is a defining image of the Bernhardt presidency.\n\nI was invited to attend commencement as a retiring professor with 25 years of teaching and research; in fact, I am believed to be the first Black professor emeritus since the founding of Emerson in 1880. I declined with regrets because I fear that Sunday's scheduled ceremony will be yet another ostensible forum for peaceful protest that is likely to devolve into an extreme security response.\n\nI ask for the understanding of the graduating class. I would be proud to represent Emerson at commencement when an enlightened president is in office.\n\nI walked through the Emerson College encampment in the public alleyway off of Boylston Street on the evening of April 24 around 6 on my return from work at Tufts Medical Center, hours before the 2 a.m. police raid that followed. Dressed in work clothes, I entered the alley through the Transportation Building mall during a rainstorm. I was met by a smiling young woman who offered me a poncho. I stood around in the alley for about 15 to 30 minutes and observed students milling about, chatting, going in and out of buildings. Across the street, about five pro-Israel demonstrators held flags, chanting and yelling. The demonstrators in the alley stood calmly.\n\nI texted my daughter, who has friends at Emerson, about how impressive those protesters in the encampment were, caring about the suffering of a people so far away.\n\nI know and like the alleyway. I used to go there to a nightclub decades ago. The four of five tents that had been set up gave passersby plenty of room to walk through. I saw no one interfere with any pedestrian. I saw no evidence of Mayor Michelle Wu's \"safety\" concerns. There was no good reason for what happened there later.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Alexander_(jazz_saxophonist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Alexander (jazz saxophonist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeritus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emeritus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Wu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Wu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufts_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tufts Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boylston_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boylston Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gristmill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gristmill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poncho", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poncho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_Columbian_Exposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World's Columbian Exposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nightclub"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Baha'ism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Baha'ism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/C8xrh5BuElcbx-GFByodkx5ZDTA=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/RNQIEZPNOL4ZY33B44PKGWC3MU.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550785", "eventUri": "eng-9550785", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 2228, "textEnd": 2236}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

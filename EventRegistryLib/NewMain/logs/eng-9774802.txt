Gavin Newsom's recent order for local jurisdictions to proceed with the clearing of homeless encampments, saying immediate sweeps are the wrong way to deal with them.\n\nMehan released his statement about the executive order on Sunday, noting that he understands Newsom's frustration with sprawling homeless encampments in California's urban centers, but insisting that the homeless have to have options for new living spaces.\n\n\"Clearing encampments only works if we have places for people to go, and require that they use them,\" Mahan said.\n\nThe governor's executive order urges cities to adopt homelessness policies consistent with those of the California Department of Transportation, which, for several years, has aggressively cleared encampments along highways and on-ramps.\n\nNewsom also encouraged cities to apply for more than $3 billion in funds earmarked to assist in efforts to clear encampments.\n\n\"There are no more excuses,\" said Newsom in a recorded statement Thursday.\n\nNewsom's executive order follows a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June that overturned a precedent requiring cities to first provide shelter before removing homeless encampments.\n\nSome cities, like San Francisco, took the Supreme Court decision as an invitation to increase homelessness sweeps. The ruling would enable San Francisco to impose penalties on people who had previously refused outreach services, San Francisco Mayor London Breed told the board of supervisors earlier this month.\n\n\"San Francisco is already doing what the governor is calling for,\" Breed's office boasted on Monday.\n\nBut as Newsom's directive focuses solely on moving homeless people from streets, numerous politicians and advocacy organizations have responded along the lines of \"but to where?\"\n\nSan Jose isn't the only California city to pump the brakes on Newsom's message. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has also criticized Newsom's order, arguing for more housing instead of criminalizing street camping.\n\n\"Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work,\" she said in the wake of Newsom's order.\n\nMahan offered a similar rationale for his position.\n\n\"Without these solutions, we spend precious taxpayer dollars simply shuffling people from one jurisdiction's land to another's,\" he said.\n\nThe statements from Mahan and Bass echo those from homelessness advocacy organizations like the National Alliance to end Homelessness, which criticized Newsom ordering encampment sweeps without first ensuring housing for homelessness populations.\n\nSan Jose has invested in housing. From 2021-2022, San Jose spent about $50 million on constructing permanent and interim housing for homeless people, according to data released by the city. Between 2022 and 2023, it was able to reduce its unsheltered homeless population by more than 10%, even as total homeless in the city increased. The difference, according to San Jose's point-in-time surveys, was that it was able to provide shelter for 5% more people.\n\nIn his Sunday statement, Mahan contrasted these reductions with California's statewide homeless population, which saw an increase of about 8,000 unsheltered people during the same time according to federal data.\n\n\"Every city must show equal resolve in expanding shelter and in-patient treatment beds so we can offer people a dignified place to go,\" Mahan said.\n\nMahan's numbers stood in contrast to the type of metrics used by Newsom to announce his executive order. Instead of focusing on the number of homeless people, Newsom touted the almost 250,000 cubic yards of debris from encampments the state has removed since 2021.\n\nStill, Mahan entertained the possibility of sweeps similar to those ordered by Newsom. But the city would first have to expand the number of places for homeless people to go, he said.\n\n\"Our approach is working,\" Mahan said, \"but we have to continue to add safe and managed places for people to go if we are going to be in a position to ban camping citywide.\n\nSan Francisco's largest private employer is making a move that could help other struggling downtown businesses thrive\n\nTech leaders are gathering in San Jose for the Momentum AI Conference, where there are still concerns over security and safety when it comes to artificial intelligence.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mahan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Mahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karen Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Breed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Breed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/02/7d99b040-2aed-45fc-942a-a640f03a9fdb/thumbnail/1200x630/67915cdb8cd5d3b621ff8124ed69e729/sj-creek-homeless.jpg?v=5501038cbc281520ff9fdc308faab7dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774802", "eventUri": "eng-9774802", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom's executive order to clear homeless encampments, Los Angeles is pushing back, refusing to allow its jails to be used to hold those removed from encampments.\n\nNewsom, the Democratic governor of the state with the nation's largest homeless population, issued a directive last week ordering state officials to begin dismantling encampments on state property and encouraging local governments to adopt policies consistent with the state's. His order followed a US Supreme Court decision that upheld an Oregon city's homeless policy.\n\nIn San Francisco, Mayor London Breed will proceed with her administration's plans to implement \"progressive penalties,\" or more aggressive enforcement, on homeless encampments, her office said in a news release - a move that had been put on hold by an appeals court awaiting the US Supreme Court decision.\n\n\"Warnings will be followed by citations,\" the release said. \"In some cases, citations could be followed by escalating penalties, including arrest. The goal is not punishment, it is compliance.\"\n\nBut officials in Los Angeles have made clear they won't be heeding the governor's encouragement to follow suit.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday in support of a motion affirming its jails won't be used to hold homeless people arrested when encampments are broken up, The Los Angeles Times reported. County officials have said the approach is already in effect.\n\n\"We're not going to go to a race to the bottom,\" County Supervisor Hilda Solis said, according to the Times. \"We're not going to turn our backs. We're not going to use our jails to somehow incarcerate and criminalize people who are on the street.\"\n\nSupervisor Lindsey Horvath noted someone who is endangering public safety or committing other crimes at an encampment could still be arrested and jailed, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\n\"We aren't saying that if there's violent crime happening at a homeless encampment that that is not an arrestable offense,\" Horvath said. \"We aren't saying anything like that at all. In fact, what we're being clear about is that we are not criminalizing poverty or homelessness.\"\n\nLate last month, the results of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority's point-in-time count - conducted in January - showed the homeless population in Los Angeles had dropped for the first time in six years. It showed overall homelessness and in particular unsheltered homelessness was down in both Los Angeles County and the city. According to the count, homelessness was down 2.2% in the Los Angeles and 0.27% in the county. There were still 45,253 homeless people counted in the city and 75,312 people unhoused in the county, the authority reported.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass last week said that the city would focus on \"a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization.\"\n\n\"Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work,\" she said.\n\nThe differing approaches from two of California's largest cities comes after the Supreme Court in June ruled in favor of the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, which ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside, rejecting arguments that doing so violated the Constitution's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part,\" Newsom said last week, directing state agencies to \"adopt humane and dignified policies\" and \"move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.\"\n\nHomeless advocates and some elected officials immediately voiced outrage, saying the crackdown - without providing adequate shelter and other services - would simply move people to other areas in a state where the cost of living is high and the number of shelter beds limited.\n\n\"Governor Newsom, where do you expect people to go? This is a shameful moment in California history,\" said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent organization of the Housing is a Human Right initiative, accusing the governor of \"criminalizing poverty\" and \"doubling down on failed policies.\"\n\nThe 9th Circuit of Appeals had issued an injunction against San Francisco's \"progressive penalties\" plans amid a lawsuit filed by advocacy group Coalition on Homelessness, but a Tuesday news release from the San Francisco mayor's office said the court has \"officially modified\" the injunction against the city \"to be in line\" with the US Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn laying out the new policy, the city said it would continue to conduct encampment operations by \"offering shelter and services to those on the street.\" The San Francisco Police Department will work with city officials to \"address smaller encampments on a daily basis\" to prevent re-encampments and to prevent smaller ones from growing, the release said.\n\nCalifornia has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nNewsom's order directs, but does not mandate, state agencies and departments to adopt \"policies and plans consistent\" with the existing encampment policy of the state Department of Transportation.\n\nThe department provides \"advance notice of clearance and works with local service providers to support those experiencing homelessness at the encampment, and stores personal property collected at the site\" for at least 60 days, Newsom's office said.\n\nHomeless people refusing services is a 'political trope,' advocacy group says\n\nBreed, San Francisco's mayor, is running for re-election and tackling homelessness has become a key issue. A shelter waiting list, operated by the city's Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, showed 138 people were in line for shelter Tuesday evening.\n\nThe city government's most recent count showed 4,354 homeless people were unsheltered in San Francisco on a night in January.\n\nBreed's office said \"a majority of the times\" city staff encounter people in encampments and offer shelter, they refuse, and over the last year, refusals happened in 67% of encounters.\n\nJennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, said the organization disagrees with that claim and the data is unclear because there are not enough shelter beds for the state's homeless population.\n\nWhile some may refuse, Friedenbach said, others are counted as refusals when there isn't a place to house them.\n\n\"It's very convenient for politicians to say that homeless people are refusing services. That is a political trope that's been tossed around for years,\" Friedenbach said, adding that when people are cleared from encampments, they have \"nowhere to go.\"\n\n\"What we see, day and day again, is that when there is an appropriate, accessible offer for folks, it is taken immediately - immediately. And we see people jumping through so many hoops to get services to no avail,\" Friedenbach continued.\n\nUnder the mayor's new rules, teams from San Francisco's Healthy Streets Operations Center will return to areas that have been cleared to prevent re-encampment, but they will not necessarily make a new offer of shelter.\n\nResearchers at Boston and Cornell universities, in a policy brief last year, said \"punitive policing strategies\" such as encampment removals \"do not reduce or end homelessness.\"\n\n\"Such strategies often worsen homelessness. For example, fines and fees make it harder to access employment and social services; in some cases criminal charges impact people's eligibility for existing social services and housing programs,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"Property confiscation during encampment clearance may come at the expense of documents that are essential for obtaining housing, employment, insurance, like birth certificates and identification,\" they added, noting a link between criminal arrests and cycles of homelessness.\n\nCNN's Ray Sanchez and Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_tucker@aol.com", "name": "Emma Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "cheri_mossburg@aol.com", "name": "Cheri Mossburg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_articles_945/e30afe35ba2b9811572bb493d93e5900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774802", "eventUri": "eng-9774802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Breed has expanded capacity since taking office in 2018, but the city is still short.\n\n\"The goal of this enforcement is for people to accept offers of shelter and know that they cannot remain where they are. Staff will not be required to re-offer shelter in an area where they\u00b4ve recently been working to clear an encampment if individuals return to that same area,\" said the release.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in June made it easier for cities to ban homeless encampments, an issue cropping up in more parts of the country amid the high costs of housing and opioid drug crisis. In California, which is home to nearly a third of an estimated 650,000 homeless people in the U.S., Gov. Gavin Newsom last week ordered state agencies to begin removing tents and structures on state land.\n\nIn central California, the Fresno City Council gave initial approval Monday to a ban on homeless camping despite impassioned pleas from residents and advocates that people should not be punished for being poor.\n\nSan Francisco Supervisor Dean Preston speaks at a news conference opposing Mayor London Breed's crackdown on homeless encampments in San Francisco on Tuesday, July 30, 2024.

(AP Photo/Terry Chea)\n\nIn San Francisco, a multi-department unit goes out to clear encampments at least twice a day, five days a week, with homeless residents receiving advance notice of upcoming cleanings and outreach.\n\nThat will continue, but city workers can now return to cleared areas to force out a returning person.

Newsom announced the brutal crackdown just four days after endorsing vice president Kamala Harris's campaign for president, and it is a harbinger of the intensifying right-wing attacks workers can expect from the Democratic Party during the election campaign and beyond.\n\nThe housing crisis in California has been sharply escalating over recent years, with the number of homeless growing by 40 percent over the past five years. Housing prices and rents have remained well beyond the reach of ordinary families, driving the state to have the highest functional poverty rate in the US.\n\nCalifornia has been dominated by the Democratic Party, with the legislature under their control continuously since 1997, and only one Republican Governor (Arnold Schwarzenegger) since 1999. It is this party that is responding to the growing social crisis in the state with police repression.\n\nUnder Newsom's order, authorities must provide only a 48-hour notice to homeless people living on public land before they clear a site, and must store the belongings of the inhabitants for sixty days. Municipalities are not directly required to abide by Newsom's anti-homeless executive order; however, the Newsom administration has threatened to withhold $1 billion in state funds from cities that do not comply.\n\nNewsom's executive order was made possible by the US Supreme Court's recent, reactionary decision in City of Grants Pass, Oregon, v. Johnson, which allows municipalities to clear homeless encampments even when cities do not have an adequate number of beds in homeless shelters to provide to the displaced.\n\nThe high court's ruling is crucial for Newsom, because a 2023 review by the Public Policy Institute of California showed that there were only 71,000 shelter beds in the state compared to 181,000 homeless. The decision becomes effective at the beginning of August, and many of California's major cities have announced their plans to abide by Newsom's draconian executive order.\n\nDemocratic Mayors across the state have announced their support of Newsom's plan.\n\nSan Francisco mayor London Breed announced that the city will begin \"very aggressive\" sweeps of homeless encampments. Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao released a statement praising Newsom's executive order: \"I do believe that what the governor has done today is a step forward in the right direction,\" adding \"We've been doing this work already. Since taking office, we cleared the largest encampment in Northern California, and that is Wood Street.\" San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan jumped at the opportunity to clear homeless encampments. \"We're eager to work with the state to responsibly and quickly remove encampments from state property in San Jose, especially those adjacent to neighborhoods and in dangerous areas along our freeways and on- and off-ramps. we appreciate Governor Newsom's order, signaling that the state is also ready to solve this crisis with both compassion and urgency.\"\n\nNewsom's war on homelessness has received bipartisan support across the Golden State. Republican Fresno Mayor Jerry Dyer has taken the hardest stance in the state, announcing, with the support of three city council members, local legislation that bans homelessness punishable by a misdemeanor offense that carries up to a $1,000 fine or one-year imprisonment. If given final approval on August 15, the Fresno Police Department will be allowed to arrest any person who sits, lies, or sleeps on public property, regardless of bed space in local homeless shelters.\n\nThe effort to criminalize homelessness in California is even more barbaric when the unconstitutional overcrowding of the state's prisons is taken into consideration. Beginning with the \"War on Drugs,\" California saw a rapid surge of its prison population, with Democrats using law-and-order demagogy to enact right-wing legislation, including mandatory minimum sentences and three-strike laws. The Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act of 1976 was signed by Governor Jerry Brown, setting the stage for further mass incarceration of poor and working-class Californians.\n\nIn 1994, the Democratic majorities in both houses of the state legislature passed a \"three-strikes\" bill signed into law by Republican Governor Pete Wilson. Between 1980 and 2019 the state's prison population grew five-fold, from 25,000 to 125,000.\n\nAccording to a 2019 report by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, nearly three-fourths of all prisoners in the state had sentence lengths based on those two laws. The state's notoriously overcrowded prisons are currently under federal receivership due to the unconstitutionally \"cruel and unusual\" conditions caused by overcrowding.\n\nIn this historical context, Democrats and Republicans alike see homeless people as so much human debris to be swept out of sight. In September 2022, Newsom signed the CARE Act, opening new mental health civil courts dedicated to coercing people referred by police, first responders and family members into treatment.\n\nThe bill was widely denounced by human rights groups for failing to provide needed services and instead providing new mechanisms to institutionalize people for legal behavior. Human Rights Watch at the time wrote that the bill \"aimed at facilitating removing unhoused people from public view without actually providing housing and services that will help to resolve homelessness.\"\n\nBy displacing and arresting people living on the streets, California Democrats hope to sweep the most visible symptom of the failure of the capitalist system under the rug. California has an estimated homeless population of 180,000. Meanwhile, in 2022, California had over 1.2 million vacant housing units.\n\nRather than addressing skyrocketing rents and a cost of living crisis which is driving thousands onto the streets, California Democrats have routinely joined their Republican colleagues in support of police repression.\n\nDuring Vice President Harris' tenure as California Attorney General, her office adopted right-wing law-and-order policies restricting transgender inmates' right to medically necessary gender-affirming healthcare and forcing them to reside in prisons that did not match their gender identities, often landing them in the torturous conditions of solitary confinement for their \"safety.\" A centerpiece for her tenure as San Francisco district attorney was campaigning for criminal penalties for the parents of truant school children.\n\nDespite recent lip service claiming otherwise, Harris maintains a hard-line stance in support of Israel's genocidal campaign against Gaza, claiming that the genocidal state has a right to defend itself. The Democratic party is rallying behind Harris's law-and-order politics, as demonstrated by Newsom's executive order.\n\nThe criminalization of homelessness and poverty is a product of the capitalist system. There are more than enough vacant housing units in California to house every homeless person within the state. A socialist society would allow for the enormous number of unoccupied houses in the state to be put to social use instead of private profit, eliminating homelessness. Capitalist rule, however, will never support the state's most vulnerable populations. Only the political organization of the working class on an international socialist basis can fight the attack on democratic rights and eliminate poverty.\n\nRead moreRight-wing Supreme Court majority

Gavin Newsom to direct state officials to begin taking down homeless encampments last week.\n\nMayor London Breed will proceed with her administration's plans to implement \"progressive penalties,\" or more aggressive enforcement, on homeless encampments, her office said in a news release - a move that had been put on hold by an appeals court awaiting the US Supreme Court decision.\n\n\"Warnings will be followed by citations,\" the release said. \"In some cases, citations could be followed by escalating penalties, including arrest. The goal is not punishment, it is compliance.\"\n\nNewsom, the Democratic governor of the state with the nation's largest homeless population, ordered state officials to begin dismantling encampments on state property in a directive last Thursday. Newsom also encouraged local governments to adopt policies consistent with the state's.\n\nThe Supreme Court in June ruled in favor of the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, which ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside, rejecting arguments that doing so violated the Constitution's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part,\" Newsom said, directing state agencies to \"adopt humane and dignified policies\" and \"move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.\"\n\nHomeless advocates and some elected officials immediately voiced outrage, saying the crackdown - without providing adequate shelter and other services - would simply move people to other areas in a state where the cost of living is high and the number of shelter beds limited.\n\n\"Governor Newsom, where do you expect people to go? This is a shameful moment in California history,\" said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent organization of the Housing is a Human Right initiative, accusing the governor of \"criminalizing poverty\" and \"doubling down on failed policies.\"\n\nThe 9th Circuit of Appeals had issued an injunction against San Francisco's \"progressive penalties\" plans amid a lawsuit filed by advocacy group Coalition on Homelessness, but a Tuesday news release from the San Francisco mayor's office said the court has \"officially modified\" the injunction against the city \"to be in line\" with the US Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn laying out the new policy, the city said it would continue to conduct encampment operations by \"offering shelter and services to those on the street.\" The San Francisco Police Department will work with city officials to \"address smaller encampments on a daily basis\" to prevent re-encampments and to prevent smaller ones from growing, the release said.\n\nCalifornia has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nNewsom's order directs, but does not mandate, state agencies and departments to adopt \"policies and plans consistent\" with the existing encampment policy of the state Department of Transportation.\n\nThe department provides \"advance notice of clearance and works with local service providers to support those experiencing homelessness at the encampment, and stores personal property collected at the site\" for at least 60 days, Newsom's office said.\n\nSan Francisco's mayor, London Breed, is running for re-election and tackling homelessness has become a key issue. A shelter waiting list, operated by the city's Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing, showed 138 people were in line for shelter Tuesday evening.\n\nThe city government's most recent count showed 4,354 homeless people were unsheltered in San Francisco on a night in January.\n\nBreed's office said \"a majority of the times\" city staff encounter people in encampments and offer shelter, they refuse, and over the last year, refusals happened in 67% of encounters.\n\nJennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, said the organization disagrees with that claim and the data is unclear because there are not enough shelter beds for the state's homeless population.\n\nWhile some may refuse, Friedenbach said, others are counted as refusals when there isn't a place to house them.\n\n\"It's very convenient for politicians to say that homeless people are refusing services. That is a political trope that's been tossed around for years,\" Friedenbach said, adding that when people are cleared from encampments, they have \"nowhere to go.\"\n\n\"What we see, day and day again, is that when there is an appropriate, accessible offer for folks, it is taken immediately - immediately. And we see people jumping through so many hoops to get services to no avail,\" Friedenbach continued.\n\nUnder the mayor's new rules, teams from San Francisco's Healthy Streets Operations Center will return to areas that have been cleared to prevent re-encampment, but they will not necessarily make a new offer of shelter.\n\nResearchers at Boston and Cornell universities, in a policy brief last year, said \"punitive policing strategies\" such as encampment removals \"do not reduce or end homelessness.\"\n\n\"Such strategies often worsen homelessness. For example, fines and fees make it harder to access employment and social services; in some cases criminal charges impact people's eligibility for existing social services and housing programs,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"Property confiscation during encampment clearance may come at the expense of documents that are essential for obtaining housing, employment, insurance, like birth certificates and identification,\" they added, noting a link between criminal arrests and cycles of homelessness.\n\nCNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) executive order to start clearing homeless encampments, arguing it's only a temporary fix to a decades-old problem.\n\nBass, whose first act after taking the oath of office as Los Angeles's mayor in December 2022 was to declare a state of emergency on homelessness, has claimed Newsom's efforts to clean up the streets won't work in her city.\n\n\"I do not believe that it is ultimately a solution to homelessness,\" she said. \"How are they supposed to pay for their ticket, and what happens when they don't pay? Does it go into a warrant and give us an excuse to incarcerate somebody?\"\n\nThe clearing of encampments has largely been a partisan issue across the country, with Democrats uncomfortable kicking homeless people off the streets and Republicans, citing public safety concerns, pushing for citations and arrests.\n\nIn California, a deep blue state, the fight over homeless encampments has turned into an intraparty one, with Newsom and San Francisco Mayor London Breed on one side and Bass, along with several Los Angeles County supervisors, on the other.\n\nThe feud escalated after a Supreme Court decision last month gave local officials more power to crack down on those living on the streets and in public parks.\n\nIn Grants Pass v. Johnson, the court sided with the Oregon city in a 6-3 decision, ruling that an ordinance that made it illegal for homeless residents to camp on all public property was constitutional.\n\nThe ruling overturned a lower court decision that called it cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment to punish those sleeping outside if they had nowhere else to go. In one fell swoop, the Supreme Court decision overturned six years of legal protections for the homeless in California.\n\nLos Angeles County Supervisors' Chairwoman Lindsey Horvath has called the Grants Pass decision \"unconscionable\" and ineffective and called for more shelters and affordable housing. At a news conference, she said the solution to homelessness \"is not arrest. It is not pushing people from community to community.\"\n\n\"I want to be crystal clear,\" she added. \"The criminalization of homelessness and poverty is dangerous. It does not work, and it will not stand in Los Angeles County.\"\n\nHovarth and Supervisor Hilda Solis have proposed a policy of not allowing Los Angeles County jails to hold people arrested for violating anti-camping ordinances.\n\nOn Thursday, Newsom, a Democrat, ordered officials to start dismantling thousands of homeless encampments around the state.\n\nHis order is the most sweeping response to date following the Supreme Court decision.\n\nLocal governments are not legally bound to the order, but they are being encouraged to follow the guidance. Failure to fall in line could result in critical funds potentially being withheld.\n\nNewsom's executive order will affect thousands of people in his state, which has the highest housing costs and the highest number of homeless people in the country. Last year, 180,000 people were homeless. About 123,000 Californians were unsheltered on any given night, according to a recent count.\n\nUnlike New York City, which guarantees people the right to housing, California does not.\n\n\"The City of Los Angeles must reject Governor Newsom's inhumane, unproven policy,\" Kenneth Mejia, the Los Angeles city controller, said in a statement.\n\nIt's a different story in San Francisco, a city that's been characterized in the past as being too soft on the homelessness issue.\n\nBreed, a Democrat up for reelection in November, said in the past her hands were tied when it came to unsanctioned encampments that have remained a visible problem in the city.\n\nAfter Newsom's directive, she announced she would spearhead a \"very aggressive\" effort to clear encampments starting in August, which could include criminal penalties for those who refused to leave.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDuring a recent mayoral debate, Breed acknowledged her decision to orchestrate sweeps wasn't popular but was necessary.\n\n\"We have had to move from a compassionate city to a city of accountability,\" she said. \"And I have been leading the efforts to ensure we are addressing this issue differently than we have before.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That includes Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nBass and other Los Angeles Democrats oppose Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) order for cities and localities to clear homeless encampments. Bass said that she doesn't think clearing homeless encampments \"is ultimately a solution to homelessness.\" Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Lindsey Horvath said \"The criminalization of homelessness and poverty is dangerous.\"\n\nThat is the attitude that pervades Los Angeles's homeless response, and that is why Los Angeles (and the rest of California) has the worst homelessness crisis in the country. Homeless encampments themselves are bastions of criminal activity, including prostitution, violence, and, of course, drug crimes. They are also public safety hazards, whether it be the unsanitary conditions, the fires, or violence from drug-addicted vagrants against other people.\n\nClearing out homeless encampments is not the only solution to homelessness, but it is an important part of the process. After all, the tolerance of those encampments encourages more homelessness and discourages homeless people from moving into shelters, which typically have sobriety requirements that encampments do not. And it isn't like homeless people shouldn't have somewhere to go: Los Angeles ($950 million this year) and California ($24 billion since 2019) have spent unseemly amounts of money on homelessness.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nIf that money hasn't produced enough homeless shelter beds to offer to those at the soon-to-be-cleared encampments, that is just another indictment of the city and state Democrats that allowed this crisis to bloom in the first place.\n\nClearing homeless encampments is a necessity for functioning cities to help get homeless people out of homelessness and into shelters and future long-term housing. So long as Los Angeles fights to keep homeless encampments from being closed, the city will be unable to actually work toward ending its homelessness crisis.

Gavin Newsom put pressure on local governments to dismantle homeless encampments across California, leaders in Los Angeles County showed a united front, unanimously passing a resolution with a clear message: We will continue to take a different approach.\n\nThe vote on Tuesday by the board of supervisors, the five-member governing body of the county, reflected the deep motivation of local leaders to align themselves on strategy for a vast region that includes 88 cities and more than 75,000 homeless people. It also reaffirmed that homelessness would not be criminalized.\n\n\"Some things,\" said Supervisor Hilda Solis who co-wrote the motion, \"are better deliberated at the local level.\"\n\nThe leaders have the backing of Sheriff Robert Luna of Los Angeles County, who has vowed that his agency will arrest people only if they commit a crime, not simply for living in an encampment.\n\n\"Being homeless is not a crime, and we will maintain our focus on criminal behavior rather than an individual's status,\" Mr. Luna said.\n\nLos Angeles County has long prided itself on what it calls \"care first,\" moving its public safety response away from incarceration. When it comes to homelessness, it prefers a slower, coordinated approach that begins with encouraging those living on the streets to accept supportive services, with the eventual goal being permanent housing. Those in encampments, local leaders said, need to be treated humanely and without the specter of arrest.\n\n\"Criminalization is intentionally not part of the county's framework because it makes the problem worse by creating more barriers along people's path toward housing,\" said Va Lecia Adams Kellum, chief executive of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.\n\nSupervisor Kathryn Barger called the notion of issuing tickets to homeless people \"ludicrous\" and counterintuitive to the work that agencies have already done to establish trust with the community. \"I support the county approach that is focused so heavily on compassionate outreach paired with effective solutions,\" Ms. Barger said.\n\nThe motion, while absent of Mr. Newsom's name, seemed squarely aimed at his executive order directing state agencies to begin clearing encampments from the streets.\n\nLocal governments cannot be forced to uphold the decree, but they, along with many advocacy groups, rely on the state for billions of dollars in funding for homeless services and could feel pressure to comply at some point.\n\nMr. Newsom, perceived as a future presidential hopeful, issued the order in response to a Supreme Court ruling that allowed governments greater authority to eradicate encampments.\n\nHomelessness has been a sweeping and vexing issue in Los Angeles which, unlike New York City, does not guarantee a right to housing. As of 2023, the City of Los Angeles had about 45,000 homeless people but just 16,000 shelter beds, according to the city controller's office.\n\nSome cities like San Francisco have embraced the state order, with its mayor vowing to make homeless people so uncomfortable on the streets that they accept offers of shelter beds.\n\nAnd some Los Angeles residents welcome the idea of such change.\n\n\"We don't see adequate delivery of mental health services or drug rehabilitation services,\" said Carolyn Jordan, a resident of Brentwood, an affluent Los Angeles neighborhood, who called in to comment at Tuesday's meeting. \"We're concerned that you are ignoring potential tools that would protect our public space.\"\n\nBut Los Angeles leaders have been determined to affirm that they are already on a more viable path, swatting down any suggestions that they might change their methods.\n\nMayor Karen Bass, whose signature Inside Safe program offers motel rooms as temporary housing, believes she has proved that things are working.\n\nAccording to the annual homeless count which took place in January, the overall number of people experiencing homelessness in the city decreased by 2.2 percent from the previous year. The number of people sleeping on the street, tents or in cars decreased by 10.4 percent. It was the first time in six years that the homeless count had dropped.\n\nThe motion had support from dozens of leaders, advocates for homeless people, and residents around the county who commented at the meeting.\n\n\"We need to prioritize housing and services to move people indoors, to end homelessness, and cannot waste resources on enforcement for the sake of enforcement,\" said Joe O'Neill, who said he volunteered for an organization that works with the homeless population in the Skid Row neighborhood.\n\nStill, the issue of encampments remains at a boiling point with residents and leaders alike.\n\n\"I want to be clear, we are all frustrated with encampments that block sidewalks and the RVs that line our roads,\" said Supervisor Lindsey Horvath. \"No one thinks that any of this is acceptable.\"\n\nBut, Ms. Horvath pointed out, simply clearing tents away would not solve the problem.\n\n\"I appreciate that everyone is out of patience,\" she said. \"We are, too, but people don't just disappear.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person",

This new directive mandates counties and cities to start clearing out homeless encampments across the state.\n\nAccording to the California Budget and Policy Center, cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Sacramento are expected to be most impacted since they have the highest levels of homelessness in the state. Local city and county governments will be responsible for carrying out Newsom's order, though approaches may vary. According to Newsom, the state has allocated $24 billion to address the housing crisis. However, elected county officials in California argue that while housing is essential, addressing mental health and addiction issues needs to be the first step to solving this crisis, and in most cases, homeless individuals should be involuntarily placed in treatment. County elected officials TND spoke with said Newsom's order is nothing more than a publicity stunt.\n\nCritics of the executive order are also raising concerns about where displaced individuals will go once encampments are cleared. A survey by the University of California, San Francisco, found that 66% of homeless adults in California experience mental health issues and over half report regular use of drugs or alcohol, with many having never received treatment\n\nWhile Newsom can't force cities and counties to act, he has the option to withhold state funding from those who do not comply with the order.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision that enabled Newsom's executive order originated from the case of Johnson vs. Grants Pass in Oregon. The Court ruled that cities are not violating the Constitution by enforcing stricter rules on camping outside. This ruling opens the door for more aggressive enforcement of public property regulations.\n\nIronically, this ruling likely won't have much of an impact on the homeless population in Oregon. Oregon had already enacted House Bill 3115, which imposes strict requirements on local governments regarding the regulation of public property camping. This law makes it challenging for localities to clear encampments and penalize individuals for sleeping in public areas source.", "source": {"uri": "fox11online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WLUK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_withrow@fox11online.com", "name": "Emma Withrow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "fact_check_team@fox11online.com", "name": "Fact Check Team", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TND_(TV_station)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TND (TV station)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Francisco", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://fox11online.com/resources/media/0b04b2be-b82f-48c9-8a40-80435c108e60-large16x9_AP24208839434989.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774802", "eventUri": "eng-9774802", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom's Executive Order on Homelessness, Explained", "body": "One of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions on homelessness in decades is beginning to play out in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered state agencies to begin the process of removing homeless encampments.\n\nNewsom's executive order has been the most far-reaching response the nation has seen to the court's June 28 decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson, in which the court determined that ordinances in Grants Pass, Oregon, prohibiting sleeping on public property do not constitute \"cruel and unusual punishment\" in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The ruling found that the laws, which assess fines that can increase with repeat offenses and ultimately result in jail time, did not criminalize homelessness.\n\n\"The public-camping laws prohibit actions undertaken by any person, regardless of status,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the 6-3 opinion. \"It makes no difference whether the charged defendant is currently a person experiencing homelessness, a backpacker on vacation, or a student who abandons his dorm room to camp out in protest on the lawn of a municipal building.\"\n\nThe decision overturned a 2022 Ninth Circuit ruling that many West Coast leaders, including Newsom, believed constrained their ability to maintain clean streets in their communities. Particularly in California, but also in other western states, balancing the public safety aspects of homelessness with compassion and respect for the rights of homeless individuals has proven intractable. A 2023 census determined that roughly 180,000 people in California were homeless, living either in shelters or on the streets, representing about 30 percent of all homeless individuals in the U.S.\n\nA tool for cities.\n\nDevon Kurtz, public safety policy director at the Cicero Institute, said not much will change for homeless people in \"the vast majority of the country,\" where \"most cities already have laws that prohibit camping, and have been enforcing them to some degree.\" However, the ruling will have major implications in the nine states under the jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit, where elected officials have \"had their hands tied on how they can enforce their laws around public camping. That's where it will start to transform,\" he said.\n\nUntil the Grants Pass decision, many West Coast homeless policies were based on a 2018 Ninth Circuit decision in Martin v. Boise, which held that homeless people couldn't be punished for sleeping in public places if no adequate alternatives are available.\n\nLeague of California Cities Executive Director and CEO Carolyn Coleman said in a prepared statement that the Supreme Court's decision put \"back on the table a tool that cities can use to address the complex issue of homelessness.\" However, the key, Coleman said, is that the ability to punish homeless camping permitted by the decision will need to be accompanied by other strategies, including \"ongoing state funding to match the scale of the crisis,\" in order to fully address the problem.\n\nSome local governments moved quickly to clear homeless encampments-though not to impose penalties on homeless individuals-after the court issued its ruling in Grants Pass. In Oakland, officials posted notices near a collection of handmade shanties and parked vehicles in the shadow of the Bay Bridge that said the encampment would be cleared in a few days. On July 23, police officers and city workers began sweeping the area on the shores of San Francisco Bay, telling occupants they needed to move and offering accommodations in shelter cabins or safe parking sites. Not all the people camping there chose those options; some just left, likely for a different location.\n\nWhat Newsom's order means.\n\nTwo days later, Newsom's executive order provided a clearer course of action, calling on state agencies and local governments to act with \"urgency and dignity\" as they begin to eliminate homeless encampments across the state. In removing encampments, officials must offer homeless people support and assistance from local service providers, at least two days advance notice that the areas will be cleared, and must store their belongings for at least 60 days.\n\nIn addition, the order presses local governments to take action to remove homeless encampments from public spaces such as parks and sidewalks, particularly in situations where camps pose a health or safety hazard. In announcing his order, Newson encouraged local governments to apply for $3.3 billion in grant funding from Proposition 1, narrowly passed by voters earlier this year to provide more funding for mental and behavioral health treatment in hopes of getting homeless people off the streets and into stable housing.\n\nWhile California officials reacted rapidly to the Supreme Court's ruling, the legislature in the state where the case originated is eyeing potential changes to its laws. The Grants Pass ruling could affect a 2021 Oregon statute requiring that local regulations on where people can sleep be \"objectively reasonable.\" At least two Democratic state legislators in Oregon have indicated that they would like to repeal the law, which critics have called too vague. \"Communities should have clarity, and we may need to rewrite the law,\" state Rep. Paul Evans said. \"Or because of this decision, the law may in effect be moot.\"\n\nInfluences on policy elsewhere.\n\nWhile states outside of the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction will not be directly affected by the Supreme Court's ruling, the decision is still likely to influence and promote new homelessness policies. This can already be seen in Colorado, where, on July 8, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston proposed a sales tax increase expected to generate $100 million annually to be directed to affordable housing projects. Donald Burnes, founder of the Center for Housing and Homelessness Research at the University of Denver, said he suspects that this move was, in part, motivated by the ruling in an effort to reduce the number of homeless individuals sleeping outside who could be vulnerable to prosecution under the new decision.\n\nThough Denver possesses the largest homeless population in Colorado, Burnes believes that having a mayor who is sympathetic to the homeless will spare homeless individuals in Denver from criminalized homeless camping. However, Burnes said, in the areas surrounding Denver, existing efforts to get rid of homeless encampments are likely to be spurred on by the decision. \"We are going to see lots more people cited, ticketed, and jailed,\" he said.\n\nIn Chicago, another large city with a major homeless problem, the Supreme Court decision is not likely to influence homeless policy very much at all. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has stated that the city will not criminalize homeless camping following the new ruling, according to 38th Ward Alderman Nicholas Sposato. Sposato told The Dispatch this means that local elected officials in Chicago will not be able to ban public camping for homeless individuals, even in their individual wards.\n\nThe Chicago municipal code states that, \"No person shall use any public way for the storage of personal property, goods, wares or merchandise of any kind.\" While this law doesn't explicitly forbid the use of tents, city officials have interpreted it to mean that city sidewalks should not be blocked by tents or temporary shelters. However, Illinois law offers strong protections for the rights of homeless citizens. The 2013 Illinois Bill of Rights for the Homeless Act mandates that Illinois residents not be treated differently because they are homeless. Together, the municipal code and homeless bill of rights mean that tent usage can be regulated and restricted, but it cannot be outright prohibited.\n\nBecause of this, Shiloh Capone, executive director of Street Samaritans, believes there is no \"political will\" to \"criminaliz(e)\" homeless camping. Capone hopes that the Supreme Court decision will put a \"national spotlight\" on the issue of homelessness, to encourage \"every city to make a decision about how to address homelessness.\"\n\nRead more at The Dispatch", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ordinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local ordinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_v._Boise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin v.

Gavin Newsom to direct state officials to begin taking down homeless encampments last week.\n\nMayor London Breed will proceed with her administration's plans to implement \"progressive penalties,\" or more aggressive enforcement, on homeless encampments, her office said in a news release - a move that had been put on hold by an appeals court awaiting the US Supreme Court decision.\n\n\"Warnings will be followed by citations,\" the release said. \"In some cases, citations could be followed by escalating penalties, including arrest. The goal is not punishment, it is compliance.\"\n\nNewsom, the Democratic governor of the state with the nation's largest homeless population, ordered state officials to begin dismantling encampments on state property in a directive last Thursday. Newsom also encouraged local governments to adopt policies consistent with the state's.\n\nThe Supreme Court in June ruled in favor of the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, which ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside, rejecting arguments that doing so violated the Constitution's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part,\" Newsom said, directing state agencies to \"adopt humane and dignified policies\" and \"move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.\"\n\nHomeless advocates and some elected officials immediately voiced outrage, saying the crackdown - without providing adequate shelter and other services - would simply move people to other areas in a state where the cost of living is high and the number of shelter beds limited.\n\n\"Governor Newsom, where do you expect people to go? This is a shameful moment in California history,\" said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent organization of the Housing is a Human Right initiative, accusing the governor of \"criminalizing poverty\" and \"doubling down on failed policies.\"\n\nThe 9th Circuit of Appeals had issued an injunction against San Francisco's \"progressive penalties\" plans amid a lawsuit filed by advocacy group Coalition on Homelessness, but a Tuesday news release from the San Francisco mayor's office said the court has \"officially modified\" the injunction against the city \"to be in line\" with the US Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn laying out the new policy, the city said it would continue to conduct encampment operations by \"offering shelter and services to those on the street.\" The San Francisco Police Department will work with city officials to \"address smaller encampments on a daily basis\" to prevent re-encampments and to prevent smaller ones from growing, the release said.\n\nCalifornia has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nNewsom's order directs, but does not mandate, state agencies and departments to adopt \"policies and plans consistent\" with the existing encampment policy of the state Department of Transportation.\n\nThe department provides \"advance notice of clearance and works with local service providers to support those experiencing homelessness at the encampment, and stores personal property collected at the site\" for at least 60 days, Newsom's office said.\n\nHomeless people refusing services is a 'political trope,' advocacy group says\n\nBreed's office said \"a majority of the times\" city staff encounter people in encampments and offer shelter, they refuse, and over the last year, refusals happened in 67% of encounters.\n\nJennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, said the organization disagrees with that claim and the data is unclear because there are not enough shelter beds for the state's homeless population.\n\nWhile some may refuse, Friedenbach said, others are counted as refusals when there isn't a place to house them.\n\n\"It's very convenient for politicians to say that homeless people are refusing services. That is a political trope that's been tossed around for years,\" Friedenbach said, adding that when people are cleared from encampments, they have \"nowhere to go.\"\n\n\"What we see, day and day again, is that when there is an appropriate, accessible offer for folks, it is taken immediately - immediately. And we see people jumping through so many hoops to get services to no avail,\" Friedenbach continued.\n\nUnder the mayor's new rules, teams from San Francisco's Healthy Streets Operations Center will return to areas that have been cleared to prevent re-encampment, but they will not necessarily make a new offer of shelter.\n\nResearchers at Boston and Cornell universities, in a policy brief last year, said \"punitive policing strategies\" such as encampment removals \"do not reduce or end homelessness.\"\n\n\"Such strategies often worsen homelessness. For example, fines and fees make it harder to access employment and social services; in some cases criminal charges impact people's eligibility for existing social services and housing programs,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"Property confiscation during encampment clearance may come at the expense of documents that are essential for obtaining housing, employment, insurance, like birth certificates and identification,\" they added, noting a link between criminal arrests and cycles of homelessness.\n\nCNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Newsom wants cities to remove homeless camps. Will it happen in SLO County?", "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a sweeping executive order Thursday that directs state agencies -- and potentially some San Luis Obispo County cities -- to ramp up clearing out homeless encampments.\n\nOn Thursday, Newsom ordered state agencies and departments to adopt policies and plans consistent with the Caltrans' existing encampment policy. Under that policy, state agencies must clear encampments from state land while providing advance notice of clearance, working with local service providers to support those experiencing homelessness at the encampment and storing personal property collected at the site for at least 60 days.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newsom said in a news release. \"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets. There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nHowever, in San Luis Obispo County, that impact may be lessened somewhat.\n\nMultiple cities The Tribune reached for comment said the executive would have little effect on the way they approach clearing homeless encampments, if any.\n\n\"While the executive order is not binding on cities, the city of San Luis Obispo's current practices are consistent with the order,\" San Luis Obispo public communications manager Whitney Szentesi said. \"For years, the city has emphasized the need for compassion and accountability when addressing homeless encampments. We will continue to use a collaborative, unified approach, and we are committed to exercising reasonable care, compassion and discretion when making decisions about homeless encampments in San Luis Obispo that are within the city's jurisdiction.\"\n\nWill Newsom's order actually affect SLO County encampment polices?\n\nDepending on who you ask, Newsom's order gives cities and state agencies more authority to clean up encampments that were previously difficult to disband thanks to the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Grants Pass vs. Johnson case.\n\nGrants Pass vs. Johnson was predicated on the idea that if a city can't house or shelter its residents, it cannot tell them to vacate from the public places where they rest.\n\nIn theory, the case limited what ordinances on camping a city could or could not enforce. In practice, many cities contacted by The Tribune said their encampment policies would not change much with Newsom's order.\n\nSan Luis Obispo County said its encampment policies already comply with the order, but it will continue to move people out of encampments and try to connect them to housing, county homeless services division deputy director Linda Belch said in a statement.\n\n\"We know simply disbanding encampments without providing housing solutions just moves the issue elsewhere,\" Belch said. \"Our goal is to address encampments, not shuffle people around.\"\n\nMost other cities will follow a similar \"wait and see\" approach in coming months to see how their policies align with Newsom's instructions.\n\nMost cities in the area, including San Luis Obispo, have some kind of policy for clearing encampments, which require removal when they pose a public health or safety issue.\n\nSan Luis Obispo's policy is to store personal belongings for up to 90 days so long as they can't be considered abandoned, soiled or potentially hazardous, which is longer than Caltrans' 60-day storage policy.\n\nIn statements to The Tribune, the cities of Grover Beach, Arroyo Grande, Pismo Beach, Paso Robles and Atascadero all said their encampment policies and efforts already align with the governor's order.\n\n\"We will be closely monitoring how the order is implemented on state-owned properties in San Luis Obispo and will work collaboratively with state agencies to ensure that state's actions are addressing root issues, including services and shelter needs, not merely pushing encampments onto City properties without connecting people to services,\" Szentesi said.\n\nThe Tribune reached out to representatives of Caltrans District 5 and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for comment, but did not receive a reply.", "source": {"uri": "sanluisobispo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_lynch@sanluisobispo.com", "name":

Gavin Newsom to direct state officials to begin taking down homeless encampments last week.\n\nMayor London Breed will proceed with her administration's plans to implement \"progressive penalties,\" or more aggressive enforcement, on homeless encampments, her office said in a news release - a move that had been put on hold by an appeals court awaiting the US Supreme Court decision.\n\n\"Warnings will be followed by citations,\" the release said. \"In some cases, citations could be followed by escalating penalties, including arrest. The goal is not punishment, it is compliance.\"\n\nNewsom, the Democratic governor of the state with the nation's largest homeless population, ordered state officials to begin dismantling encampments on state property in a directive last Thursday. Newsom also encouraged local governments to adopt policies consistent with the state's.\n\nThe Supreme Court in June ruled in favor of the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, which ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside, rejecting arguments that doing so violated the Constitution's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part,\" Newsom said, directing state agencies to \"adopt humane and dignified policies\" and \"move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.\"\n\nHomeless advocates and some elected officials immediately voiced outrage, saying the crackdown - without providing adequate shelter and other services - would simply move people to other areas in a state where the cost of living is high and the number of shelter beds limited.\n\n\"Governor Newsom, where do you expect people to go? This is a shameful moment in California history,\" said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent organization of the Housing is a Human Right initiative, accusing the governor of \"criminalizing poverty\" and \"doubling down on failed policies.\"\n\nThe 9th Circuit of Appeals had issued an injunction against San Francisco's \"progressive penalties\" plans amid a lawsuit filed by advocacy group Coalition on Homelessness, but a Tuesday news release from the San Francisco mayor's office said the court has \"officially modified\" the injunction against the city \"to be in line\" with the US Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn laying out the new policy, the city said it would continue to conduct encampment operations by \"offering shelter and services to those on the street.\" The San Francisco Police Department will work with city officials to \"address smaller encampments on a daily basis\" to prevent re-encampments and to prevent smaller ones from growing, the release said.\n\nCalifornia has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nNewsom's order directs, but does not mandate, state agencies and departments to adopt \"policies and plans consistent\" with the existing encampment policy of the state Department of Transportation.\n\nThe department provides \"advance notice of clearance and works with local service providers to support those experiencing homelessness at the encampment, and stores personal property collected at the site\" for at least 60 days, Newsom's office said.\n\nHomeless people refusing services is a 'political trope,' advocacy group says\n\nBreed's office said \"a majority of the times\" city staff encounter people in encampments and offer shelter, they refuse, and over the last year, refusals happened in 67% of encounters.\n\nJennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, said the organization disagrees with that claim and the data is unclear because there are not enough shelter beds for the state's homeless population.\n\nWhile some may refuse, Friedenbach said, others are counted as refusals when there isn't a place to house them.\n\n\"It's very convenient for politicians to say that homeless people are refusing services. That is a political trope that's been tossed around for years,\" Friedenbach said, adding that when people are cleared from encampments, they have \"nowhere to go.\"\n\n\"What we see, day and day again, is that when there is an appropriate, accessible offer for folks, it is taken immediately - immediately. And we see people jumping through so many hoops to get services to no avail,\" Friedenbach continued.\n\nUnder the mayor's new rules, teams from San Francisco's Healthy Streets Operations Center will return to areas that have been cleared to prevent re-encampment, but they will not necessarily make a new offer of shelter.\n\nResearchers at Boston and Cornell universities, in a policy brief last year, said \"punitive policing strategies\" such as encampment removals \"do not reduce or end homelessness.\"\n\n\"Such strategies often worsen homelessness. For example, fines and fees make it harder to access employment and social services; in some cases criminal charges impact people's eligibility for existing social services and housing programs,\" the researchers said.\n\n\"Property confiscation during encampment clearance may come at the expense of documents that are essential for obtaining housing, employment, insurance, like birth certificates and identification,\" they added, noting a link between criminal arrests and cycles of homelessness.\n\nCNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news",

Breed has expanded capacity since taking office in 2018, but the city is still short.\n\n\"The goal of this enforcement is for people to accept offers of shelter and know that they cannot remain where they are. Staff will not be required to re-offer shelter in an area where they've recently been working to clear an encampment if individuals return to that same area,\" said the release.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in June made it easier for cities to ban homeless encampments, an issue cropping up in more parts of the country amid the high costs of housing and opioid drug crisis. In California, which is home to nearly a third of an estimated 650,000 homeless people in the U.S., Gov. Gavin Newsom last week ordered state agencies to begin removing tents and structures on state land.\n\nIn central California, the Fresno City Council gave initial approval Monday to a ban on homeless camping despite impassioned pleas from residents and advocates that people should not be punished for being poor.\n\nIn San Francisco, a multi-department unit goes out to clear encampments at least twice a day, five days a week, with homeless residents receiving advance notice of upcoming cleanings and outreach.\n\nThat will continue, but city workers can now return to cleared areas to force out a returning person. Also, new teams of police and public works employees will go out daily to address smaller encampments.\n\nBreed, who is in a tough reelection bid, said the city will still offer services and shelter. But new methods are needed as homeless people reject two-thirds of shelter offers. Enforcement will be progressive, with warnings followed by citations, escalating penalties, and even arrest, according to her office.\n\nHomeless people say they have rejected shelter offers because they can't take all their belongings or bring pets, or they have had traumatic encounters with staff or other residents. They were among those who sued the city in 2022, alleging the city was not providing notice or making real offers of shelter. The case is pending.\n\nHomeless advocates in San Francisco said at a Tuesday press event that hundreds of subsidized housing units and hotel rooms are vacant and available, but officials are focused instead on encampment sweeps that worsen the situation.\n\n\"Our local officials are choosing to confiscate people's property, survival gear, medications, the last items they're holding on to after losing everything, instead of offering... a place to live,\" said Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness.\n\nOfficials with Los Angeles County said at a supervisors' board meeting Tuesday they disagreed with the governor's approach to addressing homelessness.\n\n\"Criminalization is intentionally not part of the county's framework because it makes the problem worse by creating more barriers along people's path to housing, and it runs counter to our goals to create a more equitable system,\" said Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority CEO Va Lecia Adams Kellum.\n\n-- -\n\nreporter Jaimie Ding contributed from Los Angeles.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Newsom also encouraged local governments to adopt policies consistent with the state's.\n\nThe Supreme Court in June ruled in favor of the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, which ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside, rejecting arguments that doing so violated the Constitution's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Breed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Breed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774802", "eventUri": "eng-9774802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

County Board of Supervisors in response to the June 28 U.S. Supreme Court \"Grants Pass\" decision.\n\nThe court removed the Eighth Amendment protection of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" and allowed cities to cite or arrest people for camping, sitting, sleeping, or lying in public spaces, even if no shelter beds or other resources exist, according to a county report.\n\n\"I find it almost ludicrous to issue tickets for people unhoused,\" said Fifth District Supervisor Kathryn Barger. \"It is counterintuitive and it is not the way to address what's going on on our streets.\"\n\nThe city of Palm Springs earlier this month passed an anti-encampment law that gives police the power to arrest anyone who builds an encampment or is sleeping in a public space such as a sidewalk or park. San Francisco plans more aggressive encampment sweeps in August.\n\n\"We are not criminalizing poverty or homelessness,\" declared Third District Supervisor and board chair Lindsey Horvath, reiterating a standing policy. \"L.A. County jails will not be held for people arrested solely with regard to anti-encampment practices.\"\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna agreed with the county stand and said the Sheriff's Department has a policy to not arrest people just for being homeless. But if someone living in a homeless encampment is threatening public safety or suspected of committing a crime, they will be arrested, he said.\n\n\"We will do the right thing by getting homeless individuals the right services,\" Luna told the board. \"If there is criminal activity occurring, people will be arrested.\"\n\nLuna further clarified that the Sheriff's Department generally doesn't put in jail those suspected of committing a misdemeanor. The overcrowding of Men's Central Jail and other county incarceration facilities leaves no room for offenders convicted of most misdemeanors, he explained. The county is under court order to reduce the population of overcrowded jail facilities.\n\nThe board motion does not tell cities how to handle homeless encampments. Instead, it will distribute the county's encampment guidelines to the county's 88 cities and is asking city organizations to pledge they will not move homeless people to other cities or into unincorporated county communities.\n\nLuna said he has a verbal promise from city police chiefs to not practice \"homeless dumping.\" He has also met with 42 cities that contract with the Sheriff's Department to listen to their concerns about homeless encampments close to schools or that block sidewalks.\n\nHorvath, who represents the San Fernando Valley and the Westside, both in Los Angeles, said she sympathized with community concerns.\n\n\"We are all frustrated with encampments that block sidewalks and RVs that block our roadways,\" Horvath said. \"I appreciate everyone is out of patience. We are, too, But people just don't disappear.\"\n\nFourth District Supervisor Janice Hahn said many cities are experiencing \"encampment fatigue.\" She said some see the Supreme Court ruling as untying their hands. \"They are tired of seeing encampments when they go to work or take their kids to school. But our jails are not the appropriate space to put someone experiencing homelessness.\"\n\nThe county board, staff and Sheriff Luna instead emphasized their approaches to moving the unhoused out of encampments and into temporary housing, and eventually permanent housing.\n\nAbout $120 million is going to pay for the county's Pathway Home program.\n\nCheri Todoroff, executive director of the county's Homeless Initiative, said the county has created thousands of interim housing beds. She said they need cooperation from more cities and motel owners to establish more temporary housing. Recently, the West Covina City Council stalled a plan to allow a temporary shelter in a motel after intense opposition.\n\n\"We need to have locations set us up through motels at local jurisdictions,\" Todoroff said. \"We need cities to partner with us.\" She also said the other challenge is moving formerly homeless people into permanent housing. That requires more master leases with apartment owners in the private rental market.\n\nCreating interim housing is expensive, she said. The interim housing program runs 24/7 and includes a substantial staffing cost. The cost ranges between $50,000 and $60,000 per person, Todoroff said.\n\nBarger cited a Pathway Home project in Duarte, Monrovia and nearby unincorporated areas that cleared several encampments and brought 30 people into housing. In Palmdale, the program moved 60 people into housing who were living in encampments and RVs.\n\nFirst District Supervisor Hilda Solis said through programs and nonprofit partners, the county added 500 beds for homeless in her district in the past three years.\n\nCapt. Geoffrey Deedrick leads the LASD Homeless Outreach Sheriff Team (HOST) which teams a deputy with a homeless outreach worker. They visit encampments and after forming relationships they arrange temporary shelter usually at motels, he said. They've been seen along the San Gabriel River banks in the San Gabriel Valley.\n\nSince 2015, the HOST program has not issued a citation or made any arrests, Luna said. Deedrick said often they track down the homeless person's relative and that's another way to find housing.\n\nSome who see the Sheriff's Department's treatment of inmates at county jails as a problem don't want a uniformed officer to go to homeless encampments because they think it sends an intimidating message.\n\n\"It is absurd the Sheriff Department is a model for being kind and compassionate,\" said Anthony Arena with Justice LA Coalition. \"Why are we involving the Sheriff's Department at all?\"\n\nA report on homeless encampments and support from local cities will come back to the supervisors in about four months.", "source": {"uri": "dailybreeze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Breeze"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_scauzillo@dailybreeze.com", "name": "Steve

Gavin Newsom put pressure on local governments to dismantle homeless encampments across California, leaders in Los Angeles County showed a united front, unanimously passing a resolution with a clear message: We will continue to take a different approach.\n\nThe vote Tuesday by the board of supervisors, the five-member governing body of the county, reflected the deep motivation of local leaders to align themselves on strategy for a vast region that includes 88 cities and more than 75,000 homeless people. It also reaffirmed that homelessness would not be criminalized.\n\n\"Some things,\" said Supervisor Hilda Solis who co-wrote the motion, \"are better deliberated at the local level.\"\n\nThe leaders have the backing of Sheriff Robert Luna of Los Angeles County, who has vowed that his agency will arrest people only if they commit a crime, not simply for living in an encampment.\n\nLos Angeles County has prided itself on what it calls \"care first,\" moving its public safety response away from incarceration.

Johnson, the justices last month found it is not unconstitutional for a city to ban homeless encampments, even if there is no shelter available. The ruling, which Newsom cheered, gives city leaders broad authority to crack down on camps.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass, who opposed the Grants Pass ruling last month, also was critical of Newsom's new order.\n\n\"Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work,\" she said in an emailed statement. \"We thank the Governor for his partnership thus far and hope that he will continue collaboration on strategies that work.\"\n\nBut business interests applauded the governor for taking action.\n\n\"Getting our many thousands of unhoused residents indoors and out of unsafe, unhealthy and inhumane outdoor encampments is critical to ending California's homelessness crisis,\" Jim Wunderman, President and CEO of the business-backed public policy group the Bay Area Council, said in an emailed statement. \"California cities must now rise to meet this moment, to grab this opportunity and provide the shelter and housing that can end our long homelessness nightmare and restore a sense of order and civility to our streets, sidewalks and other public spaces.\"\n\nPer Newsom's new order, state agencies are to model their encampment policies around one that Caltrans has used for several years to remove camps on highway on and off ramps, under overpasses and on other land maintained by the transit agency. State agencies should warn residents at least 48 hours before clearing a camp. They also are required to store residents' belongings for at least 60 days, and to request services for displaced residents from local organizations. If an encampment poses an \"imminent threat\" to life, health, safety or infrastructure, the agency can remove a camp immediately.\n\nCaltrans has cleared 11,188 encampments since July 2021, according to the governor's office. Newsom has personally attended some of those cleanups, wearing a baseball hat and gloves to help pick up trash left behind.\n\nBut Caltrans has faced backlash for the way it handles encampment cleanups. In 2020, the agency agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle a lawsuit that accused it of destroying property belonging to homeless Alameda County residents.\n\nNewsom took a softer tone with local governments, urging them to voluntarily adopt policies similar to the one used by Caltrans. He also promised the state, via the California Interagency Council on Homelessness, will provide guidance and technical assistance to help local leaders set up programs.\n\nClearing, also known as \"sweeping,\" encampments is a controversial strategy for dealing with homelessness. Without moving people into housing, all sweeps do is make homelessness less visible without actually solving the problem, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, said on X in response to Newsom's order.\n\n\"You get your highway off ramp clean for a moment only,\" he said.\n\nIt's unclear how the order will be enforced, and whether there will be any penalties for cities and counties that don't ramp up efforts to clear homeless camps. Newsom could withhold funding from local governments that he feels are not meeting his expectations, as he's done in the past. In 2022, he briefly rescinded $1 billion from cities and counties after accusing them of failing to take big enough steps to reduce homelessness.\n\nThis month, Newsom's office clawed back $10 million that had been allocated to San Diego County to set up 150 tiny homes for homeless residents. The county took too long to come up with a plan for the tiny homes, according to the governor's office. Those 150 tiny homes were supposed to be part of a larger effort to deploy 1,200 state-funded tiny homes throughout California. In May, CalMatters reported that delays and about-faces had stymied the program, and only 150 of the small dwellings had been purchased.\n\nCalMatters has requested additional details from the governor's office regarding the scope of his executive order and how it will be enforced, and will update this story with more information.", "source": {"uri": "mendovoice.com", "dataType": "news",

Breed has expanded capacity since taking office in 2018, but the city is still short.\n\n\"The goal of this enforcement is for people to accept offers of shelter and know that they cannot remain where they are. Staff will not be required to re-offer shelter in an area where they've recently been working to clear an encampment if individuals return to that same area,\" said the release.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In California, which is home to nearly a third of an estimated 650,000 homeless people in the U.S., Gov. Gavin Newsom last week ordered state agencies to begin removing tents and structures on state land.\n\nIn central California, the Fresno City Council gave initial approval Monday to a ban on homeless camping despite impassioned pleas from residents and advocates that people should not be punished for being poor.\n\nIn San Francisco, a multi-department unit goes out to clear encampments at least twice a day, five days a week, with homeless residents receiving advance notice of upcoming cleanings and outreach.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThat will continue, but city workers can now return to cleared areas to force out a returning person. Also, new teams of police and public works employees will go out daily to address smaller encampments.\n\nBreed, who is in a tough reelection bid, said the city will still offer services and shelter. But new methods are needed as homeless people reject two-thirds of shelter offers. Enforcement will be progressive, with warnings followed by citations, escalating penalties, and even arrest, according to her office.\n\nHomeless people say they have rejected shelter offers because they can't take all their belongings or bring pets, or they have had traumatic encounters with staff or other residents. They were among those who sued the city in 2022, alleging the city was not providing notice or making real offers of shelter. The case is pending.\n\nHomeless advocates in San Francisco said at a Tuesday press event that hundreds of subsidized housing units and hotel rooms are vacant and available, but officials are focused instead on encampment sweeps that worsen the situation.\n\n\"Our local officials are choosing to confiscate people's property, survival gear, medications, the last items they're holding on to after losing everything, instead of offering... a place to live,\" said Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness.\n\nOfficials with Los Angeles County said at a supervisors' board meeting Tuesday they disagreed with the governor's approach to addressing homelessness.\n\n\"Criminalization is intentionally not part of the county's framework because it makes the problem worse by creating more barriers along people's path to housing, and it runs counter to our goals to create a more equitable system,\" said Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority CEO Va Lecia Adams Kellum.\n\n-- -\n\nAP reporter Jaimie Ding contributed from Los Angeles.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

They don't help you when you need it. I've been there a couple of times and I pretty much gave up,\" Malmen continued.\n\nMalmen is one of more than 180,000 people facing homelessness in California, according to a 2023 Homeless Assessment Report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nShe is concerned about the new order.\n\n\"My first instinct is I don't think it's going to help much,\" Malmen continued.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom's executive order urges state agencies to move quickly to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the people living in them.\n\n\"Currently the County of San Luis Obispo is under compliance with that executive order,\" said Suzie Freeman, Communications Program Manager for San Luis Obispo County's Homeless Services Division.\n\nShe says that includes providing adequate advanced notice, conducting early outreach through homeless services, and offering temporary storage for personal belongings.\n\n\"We want to make sure everyone is on the same page. We want to have a game plan established before we go out and work with the people to make sure they have the resources and housing they need to transition from an encampment to permanent housing,\" Freeman said. \"We're also making sure we can expand our housing capacity to make sure that people have someplace to go. We're not interested in shuffling people around.\"\n\nKSBY reached out to the City of San Luis Obispo which says its current practices are consistent with the executive order -- immediately addressing dangerous or hazardous encampments and working with service providers to refer people to services.\n\n\"I hope things get a little better. You have to hope for the best,\" Malmen concluded.\n\nThe city said it will continue to do outreach for people living in encampments and work closely with state agencies.", "source": {"uri": "ksby.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSBY"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mckenzie_diaz@ksby.com", "name": "McKenzie Diaz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malmen_Airbase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malmen Airbase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Luis Obispo, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Luis Obispo, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness in California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Housing and Urban Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Luis Obispo County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Luis Obispo County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c17755c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F53%2F32%2Fc8e35aa04b91a9c1f14820f15830%2Fencamp.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774802", "eventUri": "eng-9774802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Instead of arresting those sleeping outdoors, advocates called for city leaders to house homeless people in vacant spaces, such as Hotel Whitcomb.\n\nThe hotel has remained closed to the public since it was utilized by the city to house homeless individuals in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tuesday's rally on Market Street followed a late June decision by the U.S. Supreme Court and subsequent actions and announcements from state and city leaders.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned lower court rulings that found it cruel under the Eighth Amendment to punish people for sleeping outdoors, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order to clear homeless encampments, and San Francisco Mayor London Breed announced the authorization of aggressive camp sweeps expected this August.\n\nSpeaking at the podium Tuesday, San Francisco Supervisor Dean Preston thanked homeless advocates for continuing to work toward housing people \"no matter which way the political winds shift, no matter what Trump's Supreme Court says, no matter what our mayor says during an election year.\"\n\n\"The problem is, whenever we do these things and they start to work, a bunch of very, very wealthy people realize that to sustain that work, they're going to have to help fund it,\" Preston said. \"And so, they go out of their way to come up with these ridiculous and cruel narratives that somehow people are homeless because they don't want to be housed, which is absolutely absurd and offensive.\"\n\nBreed's office did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday, but the mayor previously released statements saying San Francisco is a city that prioritizes compassion.\n\n\"And we will continue to lead with services, but we cannot allow for people to refuse services and shelter when offered and available,\" Breed's statement continued.\n\nIn a video embedded in a July 25 press release from the governor's office, Newsom said he didn't think there was anything more urgent and more frustrating than addressing the issue of encampments in the state of California.\n\n\"Over the course of the last number of years, the state has stepped up, where in the past, we provided no support, no resources, to cities and counties to clean up encampments,\" Newsom said, further noting the previous legal challenges local governments faced when attempting to clean up encampments prior to the Supreme Court's decision. \"It's time to move with urgency at the local level to clean up these sites to focus on public health and focus on public safety. There are no longer any excuses.\"\n\nAlso present at the demonstration Tuesday were representatives of local advocacy organizations, such as Young Women's Freedom Center and Coalition on Homelessness, along with those who were formerly homeless and John Do, senior attorney for the Racial & Economic Justice Program at the ACLU of Northern California.\n\n\"The Eighth Amendment no longer stops the government from arresting you and jailing you for just sleeping outside, but that decision doesn't end other civil rights and important protections that we all have,\" Do said at the demonstration. \"So we're still here, and we're going to defend things like due process, equal protection, the Fourth and 14th Amendment, and state and local protections too. So the fight's not over.\"\n\nPreston called it unconscionable that the city has vacant apartments with people sleeping on the streets. The U.S. Census Bureau's most recent American Community Survey on occupancy status in San Francisco found about 52,600 units to be vacant in the city. The 2024 Point in Time count, which captures the number of those experiencing homelessness on a given night in January, counted 8,323 individuals.\n\n\"The Supreme Court issued the invitation and authorized cities and states all across the nation to criminalize poverty, to sweep and arrest homeless people for the crime of being homeless even when they're not offered anywhere to go,\" Preston said. \"Local officials in San Francisco should reject that invitation to criminalize being homeless.\"", "source": {"uri": "kron4.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KRON4"}, "authors": [],

This is about our capacity to house and deliver a well-orchestrated strategy with several ingredients: sustaining outreach work, building trust, and delivering coordinated social services.\n\nI stand by that strategy. The testimony we heard today from Sheriff Luna-along with County housing and mental health experts who lead local efforts-reaffirms that Los Angeles County has solid partnerships in place to implement compassionate strategies that work. The Governor's Executive Order means we will have an extra layer of strategic coordination with Caltrans and other state agencies, which isn't new.\n\nI believe we must continue working closely with city partners to solve homelessness regionally instead of shuffling people experiencing homelessness around or calling on law enforcement partners to cite them.

We don't have an answer.\"\n\nNewsom's executive order requires state agencies, such as the California State Parks department, to prioritize clearing encampments that pose the greatest safety risks, including those under the Southern California freeways.\n\nThe directive is supposed to provide notice to those living in temporary shelters and to connect them with service providers that can help them store their belongings for at least 60 days.", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern California"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Luna", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Luna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_Solis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hilda Solis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karen Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Sheriff's_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Barger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kathryn Barger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California_freeways", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California freeways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2022/12/GettyImages-1245753822.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774802", "eventUri": "eng-9774802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

They have answered that by getting into the construction and development business, which takes several years and is doing very little for those living on the streets now.\"\n\nPressure from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board has forced San Jose to relocate about 500 homeless residents from its waterways to expedite the clean-up of trash and pollution and comply with the Clean Water Act.\n\nIf San Jose fails to meet its mandates by next year, Mayor Matt Mahan said it could result in tens of thousands of dollars in daily fines.\n\nLast month, the San Jose City Council identified eight prospective \"safe sleeping\" or \"basic needs sites\", which included three within Willow Glen at the VTA's property, Lelong Street and Willow Street and near Almaden Road and Canoas Gardens Avenue.\n\nThese sites could temporarily serve between 100 and 150 homeless residents and provide basic necessities like food, potable water, toilets and showers.\n\nSan Jose has allocated $10 million from Measure E funds for the current fiscal year to create basic, low-cost sleeping sites. Preliminary estimates established a price tag with a range of $18,000 to $40,000 per tent, according to a city memo.\n\nThe creation of safe sleeping sites is part of a larger push to solve the homelessness crisis within the city. One of the biggest campaign promises Mahan made in becoming the city's mayor was to \"end the era of encampments.\"\n\nLast year's homelessness count found approximately 6,340 homeless residents, which included nearly 4,400 people living in encampments or vehicles.\n\nTo expedite the creation of safe sleeping sites, the city council also placed the authority in the hands of city staff to evaluate the sites and award the contracts without its approval. But it comes with a commitment to engaging council district offices to gauge community sentiment once the locations have been whittled down even further.\n\nHow the city processes that input remains to be seen, especially with Willow Glen's position that it is willing to accept one specific site so long as 11 conditions are met.\n\nThose conditions include providing service for only homeless residents in the immediate vicinity, 24-hour security, prohibiting drugs, alcohol and violent behavior and the availability of wrap-around services such as mental health, addiction and case management.\n\nThe association's board also conditioned its support on the city preventing future encampments and limiting the site's operations to three years. It includes a provision that the site must be dismantled in six months if not properly managed.\n\nWhile the city has not directly responded to the board about its position letter, Mirzadegan said the conditions set by the board aligned with conversations it had with Mahan and District 6 Councilmember Dev Davis, whose district includes Willow Glen.\n\n\"Abating encampments doesn't solve anything,\" Mirzadegan said. \"It disrupts them, forces them to move to another location and the cycle is repeated. We're willing to give help to those who want it and are willing to accept it. Communities need to come together and compromise.\"\n\nBut not everyone in the community is on board with that plan.\n\nHelen Hutchings, a Willow Glen resident and board member of its neighborhood association, told The Mercury News earlier this month that the sites should not be built in neighborhoods.\n\n\"We don't feel it's appropriate to house people in tent camps in anybody's neighborhood when the county has so much land that could be used,\" she said.\n\nMirzadegan said that Mahan indicated the neighborhood would only get one site, which is why the board narrowed down its preference to the VTA site.\n\n\"That was a more appropriate spot because it doesn't back up into anyone's backyard or neighborhood,\" she said.\n\nDavis said that city staff is still evaluating each site so she wasn't sure if every stipulation the neighborhood association put forward could be met. But she added that she would be pushing that only Willow Glen's district would receive one site.\n\nPrior to approving the sanctioned sites last month, Mahan anticipated some pushback, noting that every city historically faces some form of community opposition for these types of projects.\n\nHaving met with the board and listened to their concerns, Mahan lauded Willow Glen for buying into his plans to curb homelessness.\n\n\"Our community is stepping up to end the crisis of unmanaged encampments and untreated mental illness in San Jose,\" said Mahan. \"I'm grateful for the trust of neighbors in Willow Glen and across our city -- now it's up to City Hall to maintain that trust. We will do so by demonstrating that these solutions are effective in making our city safer and cleaner for everyone and requiring that people use them when available.\"", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_Glen,_San_Jose", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willow Glen, San Jose"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Willow Glen, San Jose"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mahan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Mahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_City_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Jose City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_Valley_Transportation_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Water_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clean Water Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaden_Valley,_San_Jose", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Almaden Valley, San Jose"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_Street,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willow Street, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Willow Street, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mercury_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mercury News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_City_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco City Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SJM-L-CREEKS-2.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774802", "eventUri": "eng-9774802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Newsom is a man about whom I harbor some violently ambivalent feelings. Despite being a reckless, imperious, and impetuous opportunist, he has, in fact, bent the needle of history in a positive direction.\n\nBut last week, he issued an executive decree ordering that all state agencies begin \"resolving\" any homeless \"encampments\" on their property, and he encouraged local governments to do the same.\n\nThere's so much to get upset about here.\n\nYet my brain chooses to focus on the word \"resolve.\" In this context, \"resolve\" means to remove, to knock down, to clear out, to eliminate, to destroy, to eradicate. But for the last four years, the government word police -- whoever they are -- have insisted all government officials use the word \"resolve\" when speaking of encampments.\n\nI get it. Sometimes homeless camps -- for the record, I also hate the term \"encampment,\" as it conjures images of military occupation -- absolutely need to be removed. Fire is real; human feces in the creeks is real; human-on-human violence can also be real.\n\nThe word \"resolve,\" however, is not remotely real. It insulates us from what we are about to do. It absolves us of any bad feelings about inflicting pain on people already in obvious pain. It's a powerful weapon. We don't even know we're firing it. It's a word that allows us to look away.\n\nAnd looking away is what most of us -- myself included -- have a tendency to do when encountering homeless people. A few years back, I entered a major homeless camp down by the DMV, where Castillo Street bumps into the 101. Lots of people there, bikes, tents, shopping carts, backpacks, sleeping bags. Stuff. And they were about to be \"resolved.\"\n\nNotice had been given. The outreach workers -- many formerly homeless and formerly alcoholic themselves -- were just showing up in their vans. Nobody in the camp would look at me. Over the years, I've been high-hatted by the best. But this was something else. I was totally invisible. Worried about possible dogs, I stayed put. And waited. It was 20 minutes before someone got curious. Who was I and what was I doing, he wanted to know. The ice was broken. We talked.\n\nOver the past four years, Joe Biden and Gavin Newsom poured umpteen billions into homelessness programs; that money trickled into local governments working with private nonprofits. In Santa Barbara, a tremendous amount has gotten done. In the last year, 1,400 homeless people got housing. Wow, right? No.\n\nIn that same time, another 2,300 people reached out for help from various homeless service agencies. Those people, very inconveniently, are not invisible. Last year, we saw a 12 percent increase in the number of homeless people counted in the Point-in-Time Count. The big spike comes from people living in their vehicles, not on the streets. Not in shelters. Seniors. Families. First-time homeless.\n\nAs a culture, we are so remarkably incurious. Very few of us really believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in assassinating John F. Kennedy, but we just shrug and move on. No one really believes we invaded Iraq over alleged weapons of mass destruction, either. But we just shrug and move on. Yet when it comes to the ubiquitous surge in homelessness, we get impatient with the homeless. Why don't they just disappear?\n\nOnly rarely do we wonder what makes these people happen.\n\nWell, we do know this. From 1970 until now, the percentage of aggregate income held by those qualifying as middle-class dropped from 62 percent to 42 percent. By contrast, the percentage held by those qualifying as upper-income increased from 29 percent to 50 percent. You can do the math yourself. Hint: Those are big numbers.\n\nHere's what I'd say to Newsom. Given that the fastest-growing unhoused demographic are people living in their vehicles, he should issue another edict ordering all state office buildings to allow programs like Safe Parking -- which for 30 years has turned about 30 parking lots throughout the county into four-wheeled homeless housing after dark. By any reckoning, it's a well-managed program. No melodrama. Porta-potties are provided. People can sleep safely.\n\nFor years, Safe Parking has been hoping to secure a few nighttime spaces at the DMV's huge empty parking lot. No luck. The DMV is not interested. What about the ocean of parking space controlled by EDD -- another state agency -- right next to the farmers' market? Nothing doing. Or the parking lot controlled by the Labor Commissioners on the 400 block of East Canon Perdido? Don't waste your breath.\n\nSafe Parking says it has its eyes on nine state-controlled parking lots that would make a lot of sense. If only five vehicles were allowed per lot a night -- a typical number for a Safe Parking lot -- that's 45 new \"housing\" units. It's not a huge number, but it's not nothing. It's also the cheapest, easiest-to-manage \"housing\" that can be provided. And it's not static. In the last year, 120 Safe Parking residents managed to find more permanent housing, opening up those slots to other people.\n\nOf the county's 750 \"encampments,\" about 21 are vehicular encampments. That translates to about 300 actual people. Seniors. Families. That's not nothing either. To Gavin Newsom, I suggest this: Resolve that. Open up your office building parking lots.", "source": {"uri": "independent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Santa Barbara Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_welsh@independent.com", "name": "Nick Welsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_motor_vehicles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Department of motor vehicles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuff_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuff (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers'_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farmers' market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parking lot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The new demand comes just days before the city is expected to begin what the mayor has called \"an aggressive approach\" to clearing longtime encampments.\n\nThe homeless advocates in a news conference Tuesday in front of the historic Hotel Whitcomb in San Francisco's Mid Market area decried the owners for letting the landmark sit empty.\n\nThe Whitcomb was used as an emergency shelter for the unhoused during the pandemic via a lease with the city. The lease has since expired.\n\nLast year, the city agreed to pay $19.5 million because of damage to the building by those emergency occupants.\n\nStill, the coalition of advocates said the city needs to do more to find shelter for those living in the streets before clearing out encampments.\n\n\"We demand our elected officials fill those empty units, bring more housing on the market, increase rental subsidies and assistance and rental protections,\" said John Do with the ACLU.\n\nDo is with the legal team that filed a federal lawsuit and triggered an injunction that had barred the city from clearing encampments. He said portions of that lawsuit will continue, despite the Supreme Court's \"grants pass\" ruling that nullified the injunction.\n\nThese advocates also claim the city currently has more than 700 permanently supportive housing units available, and filling them should be a priority.\n\nJennifer Freidenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness, said the city's system to fill those units is broken, but also admits many of those 700 plus units are not actually available.\n\n\"Some of the units need to be rehabbed, so the city needs to invest some money in about 300 of those units that need work,\" Freidenbach said. \"Carpet, maybe they had a blown pipe or something like that.\"\n\nAccording to city data, there are actually 793 permanent supportive housing units open: 398 are offline because of the repairs Friedenbach mentioned and another 229 are currently in the process of being moved into, leaving 166 available for use.\n\nTuesday's event comes ahead of what Mayor London Breed has described as more aggressive sweeps of homeless encampments beginning Wednesday.\n\nBreed made that comment during a recent mayoral debate. A spokesperson for her office said the Department of Emergency Management has already been coordinating with city agencies on clearing large encampments.\n\nPolice officers also now have the power to clear smaller or single occupant encampments as needed.\n\nIn both situations, the city said the unhoused will be offered shelter and other services.\n\nBut attorneys for the unhoused claim the city has not been keeping proper track of the items it collects from those who are cleared. The lawyers also intend to continue their court fight. They expect a trial to happen sometime next year.", "source": {"uri": "nbcbayarea.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Bay Area"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supportive_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supportive housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Breed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Breed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://media.nbcbayarea.com/2024/07/33329073199-1080pnbcstations.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774802", "eventUri": "eng-9774802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Now, California can move to clean up homeless camps.\n\nCRANSTON - As California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week directed state agencies to start clearing homeless encampments from public land, Cranston leaders took a first look at a measure that would bar tent dwellers from city land.\n\nEmboldened by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision validating an Oregon city's ban on outdoor sleeping, cities and towns throughout Rhode Island are grappling with how to address rising numbers of residents experiencing homelessness in the proliferation of tent encampments.\n\nThe Cranston City Council last week fielded an ordinance proposed by Mayor Ken Hopkins that would prohibit any type of \"shelter\" - permanent or temporary - on city land. Alleged offenders would face a $50 fine for trespassing and risk having their possessions discarded if they aren't removed within 24 hours.\n\nWhy is Cranston trying to limit tent encampments?\n\nThe ordinance comes at the urging of Police Col. Michael J. Winquist, according to Anthony C. Moretti, the mayor's chief of staff.\n\nWinquist said in an email that the measure was prompted by complaints from residents about encampments on city property, and concerns about health and safety. The camps have sprung up across the city along a bike path, next to baseball fields and near highway ramps.\n\n\"I have personally been to various encampments that are littered with human waste, uncapped/used needles, syringes (some containing blood), alcohol containers, propane containers and property stolen from nearby businesses,\" Winquist said. \"There have also been complaints of criminal acts, including drug sales and prostitution.\"\n\n\"Sex offenders and persons with criminal backgrounds often reside at these locations, making women and children fearful of enjoying these public spaces that include ball fields and walking paths,\" he continued.\n\nWinquist recounted open fires and medical emergencies at encampments that were difficult for first responders to reach. Additionally, he cited the cost of cleaning up abandoned campsites, which requires hiring an outside vendor specializing in disposal of hazardous waste.\n\nAn outreach team of police officers, mental health clinicians and social service providers will reach out to offer assistance, but if people refuse to leave, Winquist said, they will receive a civil citation.\n\n'This ordinance is brutal'\n\nThe proposal generated passionate blowback from residents and advocates for the unhoused community, many of whom referenced the city's unsuccessful effort to ban panhandling several years ago.\n\n\"This ordinance is brutal,\" Tom Wojcik told the City Council. \"We are not Americans if we don't treat each other respectfully. You don't find yourself sleeping on the road or in a park because you like it. You do it because of the circumstances in your life. It could happen to me, it could happen to all of us.\"\n\n\"Let's make this about people, about humanness, about kindness,\" he said.\n\nDeborah Flitman, a First Amendment activist who fought the panhandling ban, dismissed the encampment ordinance as immoral, inhumane and a violation of people's civil rights. Several people emphasized that the people who make their home in encampments are constituents.\n\n\"We as a city cannot be a part of criminalizing homelessness,\" Jessica Salter told the council. She urged city leaders to consider other ways to address astronomic housing costs, such as rent control or adding shelter beds.\n\nThe council voted to send the proposal to its Ordinance Committee for review, with Vice Chairperson Lammis J. Vargas and Councilor John P. Donegan voicing opposition.\n\n'We're not doing our part'\n\nCouncilor Robert J. Ferri, a Democrat who is running against Hopkins for mayor, acknowledged that encampments are an issue for the state's second largest city. He emphasized that the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness reported there are 536 more people lacking a place to live in Rhode Island than there are available shelter beds. (The number has recently climbed beyond that.)\n\n\"I realize that people want swift action when a homeless encampment is discovered,\" Ferri said in an email. \"Writing an ordinance is really not the answer.\"\n\n\"Before we can break up an encampment, we must find a place to move the occupants and to protect their precious few belongings,\" Ferri continued. \"Simply put, we need more shelters and affordable housing.\"\n\nCranston, he said, hasn't build a single unit of \"affordable\" housing in more than 13 years. Instead of fining people experiencing homelessness, he said the city should be working with experts to address the issues.\n\n\"In Cranston, we are not doing our part,\" he said.\n\nBarbara Ann Fenton Fung, who has launched a Republican challenge to Hopkins, did not respond to repeated phone calls seeking comment.\n\nIn West Warwick, 'You can't stop what's happening'\n\nWest Warwick is also beginning to weigh what steps it might take.\n\n\"We're trying to take this relatively slowly. We're trying to address it as completely as we can to address all sides of the issue,\" Town Solicitor Timothy Williamson said.\n\nHe described the encampment population as a nomadic group that shifts locations - largely along the Pawtuxet River - when they wear out their welcome at a site.\n\n\"You can't stop what's happening,\" he said. \"The group is homeless for a lot of different reasons. It's a very difficult problem.\"\n\nHe viewed former Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt's move to dismantle encampments with little warning as a cautionary tale. In the aftermath, people - some of whom had been living at the site along the Blackstone River for a year - lost their few possessions, and advocates were left scrambling to find them shelter beds.\n\n\"We don't want to get in that type of position,\" Williamson said.\n\nCurrent Woonsocket Mayor Christopher Beauchamp did not respond to messages asking about his approach.\n\nElizabeth Tufts, a spokeswoman for Warwick Mayor Frank Picozzi, didn't reply to repeated inquiries about that city's position.\n\nOlivia DaRocha, a spokeswoman for Gov. Dan McKee, said she did not expect that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling would change the state's approach.\n\nAdvocates hope cities and towns don't take cues from U.S. Supreme Court\n\nAdvocates expressed fear that the U.S. Supreme Court decision will spur communities to take enforcement measures against encampments.\n\n\"It is deeply distressing to see some local municipalities in Rhode Island consider taking advantage of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent callous decision allowing for the criminalization of homelessness,\" said Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"Forcing homeless people to move when they have nowhere to go, destroying the little property they have and engaging in the surreal attempt to fine them when, almost by definition, they have no money, is a cruel, harmful and completely ineffective response to a serious societal problem.\"\n\n\"We are hopeful that Rhode Island communities will focus on compassion, not punishment, when they seek to address this critical issue,\" he said.\n\nThe ruling and Cranston's proposed ordinance come, too, as the number of people lacking shelter reached a high of 628 at the end of June, up from 534 in January, according to Eric Hirsch, interim chair of the Rhode Island Homeless Advocacy Project. There are 875 people on the shelter-bed waiting list and 1,011 on the waiting list for housing.\n\nHirsch faulted Mayor Hopkins' proposed ordinance for mirroring the Oregon approach given the nod by the high court. The court ruled that authorities in Grants Pass, Oregon, were free to ticket people for sleeping in public, even though the town had no available shelter beds or housing to provide to those living outdoors, he said.\n\n\"The problem is that neither Grants Pass nor Rhode Island municipalities have provided viable alternatives to those sleeping outside,\" Hirsch said. \"They usually claim to be providing shelter beds, housing units and wrap-around services but in fact are providing none of these.\"\n\nHe criticized police raids of encampments in Providence and elsewhere as serving only to scatter people to more dispersed and more hidden encampments where outreach workers often cannot find them.\n\n\"It should be obvious that ... the problems that neighbors of the unsheltered are experiencing are best solved by providing humane shelter and housing alternatives to those outside,\" Hirsch said.\n\nThe number of people without shelter is climbing, too, due to evictions, Hirsch said. According to the Rhode Island Housing dashboard, 3,871 households have been evicted in 2024, overwhelmingly due to the tenants' inability to pay skyrocketing rents.\n\nHirsch said these attitudes \"effectively criminalize homelessness,\" which is \"caused by a housing market that only serves the well-off.\"\n\nHe called on McKee to declare a state of emergency in the rising homeless numbers and for his administration to add additional shelter beds. He also implored municipal leaders to stop raiding encampments until residents have shelter.", "source": {"uri": "eu.providencejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"},

Her reactions came after in-depth Board of Supervisors discussion on the matter.\n\nBarger, who represents Pasadena, responded to two significant developments: the U.S. Supreme Court's City of Grants Pass v. Johnson et al. decision and California Governor Gavin Newsom's executive order on homeless encampments removals.\n\nThe Grants Pass ruling expanded municipal officials' authority to enforce local laws on unsafe encampments. However, it has also raised concerns about potential shifts in homeless populations between jurisdictions.\n\nOn July 25, Governor Newsom issued an executive order directing state agencies to dismantle homeless encampments across California. The order emphasizes urgency and dignity in addressing the issue, urging local governments to utilize state resources.\n\nBarger focused on the complexity of clearing encampments in a County as large as Los Angeles.\n\n\"This is about our capacity to house and deliver a well-orchestrated strategy with several ingredients: sustaining outreach work, building trust, and delivering coordinated social services,\" Barger said.\n\nShe cited testimony from Sheriff Luna and County housing and mental health experts as evidence of effective partnerships in implementing compassionate strategies.\n\nBarger noted that the governor's executive order would affect coordination with state agencies.\n\n\"The Governor's Executive Order means we will have an extra layer of strategic coordination with Caltrans and other state agencies, which isn't new,\" Barger said.\n\nThe supervisor advocated for continued collaboration with city partners to address homelessness regionally. She cautioned against \"shuffling people experiencing homelessness around or calling on law enforcement partners to cite them,\" describing such methods as ineffective.\n\n\"I want to be clear: enforcement is certainly an important tool, but it needs to be applied strategically and in a way that sustains permanent change,\" Barger said. She added that enforcement \"will remain a last resort to maintain public safety and public health.\"\n\nAcknowledging criticism of the slow pace of progress, Barger defended the County's approach.\n\n\"Some believe our work to resolve homeless encampments isn't happening fast enough, but fast doesn't always mean successful,\" Barger said.", "source": {"uri": "pasadenanow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pasadena Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Barger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathryn Barger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774802", "eventUri": "eng-9774802", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 700, "textEnd": 707}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

He is autistic and doesn't say much.\n\n\"That made it even more of a struggle,\" she said. \"Being out here with my son, my mom ... and just trying to keep together as a unit. But it gets difficult.\"\n\nCoffelt said camping in plain sight is for their safety -- she feels rapes, attacks and theft happen more to people who are hidden.\n\nBut that is no longer possible for her. Escondido has joined a growing list of cities across San Diego County and the state who are banning homeless encampments.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling in City of Grants Pass v. Johnson allows cities to ban homeless encampments in public areas, even if the cities don't have enough shelter beds. Last week, Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order pressuring California cities to take action on dismantling the camps. If they don't, they could lose out on funding.\n\nCoffelt fears her safety is fading.\n\n\"The cops ... they tell everybody to move and everybody ends up going out into the jungle. I'm not going out to the jungle because things happen out there and I can't,\" Coffelt said. \"They push you further and further away from where you can get the resources.\"\n\nHer mom has dementia and is in a nursing home. Her son could get shelter in a group home, but doesn't want to be without his mom.\n\n\"He doesn't want to be taken, singled out and put in a group home. I mean ... Is that really how you handle something? You break up the family like that? It just doesn't seem right,\" she said.\n\nCoffelt doesn't want to go to a shelter because she'd have to give up her cats.\n\nHolly Herring, a homeless advocate in North County, said the bans make it harder to help people.\n\n\"Ultimately, it makes people less trustworthy. So you'll hear a lot of people say they don't want help and you have to realize there's something you need to add to that sentence for it to make sense,\" she said.\n\nShe used to be homeless and understands what people want and don't want.\n\n\"They don't want the help you're offering or they don't want the help from you,\" Herring said. \"And there can be a point in time, after a number of engagements, where somebody can come to trust that you actually have a solution for them. They'll say, 'all right, I'm interested in that solution.'\"\n\nShe thinks enforcement will burn any trust or relationship built with outreach workers.\n\n\"People are going to be more guarded about what they say, where they sleep at night, what kind of environment,\" she said. \"Their interactions with law enforcement are going to make it more difficult when they do come with the solution to actually help house people.\"\n\nWhen the cities of Escondido and San Marcos recently enforced encampment bans, they both referenced public safety in their decisions.\n\nThere is no homeless shelter in San Marcos, Instead, the city pays more than $100,000 for regional support every year.\n\n\"I am aware of these organizations that are helping in the community. But what I continue to encounter is the fact that we are told that either, there's no capacity, or that a family doesn't meet the particular qualifications,\" San Marcos Councilmember Maria Nunez said.\n\nShe was the lone vote against the ban, saying it leaves homeless people with little to no options.\n\n\"What happens to that family? What happens to those individuals?\" she asked. \"And now that we are going to be enforcing, and potentially citing individuals, potentially ending up with misdemeanor citations, then I can't help to wonder... what are we going to do with these individuals? Are they going to be detained? Are they gonna be incarcerated? Where do they go?\"\n\nInterfaith Community Services is the largest homeless service provider in Escondido.\n\nCEO Greg Anglea said the recent orders mean people need places to go even more.\n\n\"More short-term housing options,\" he said. \"But ultimately, what people need is a permanent home of their own. So it really calls for the need for rental assistance to help people overcome the high cost of getting into a new home.\"\n\nBack in Escondido, next to her overflowing shopping cart, Bobbie Coffelt has one message.\n\n\"If you really want to help, come out and meet the people,\" she said. \"Figure out what can be done instead of enforcing these laws that just push everybody away and out.

Some are causing difficult conditions, like in the City of Jamestown, where leaders declared a state of emergency.\n\nBut in the Queen City, there are much smaller encampments. 7News Senior Reporter Eileen Buckley talked to one of the city's homeless members about his situation.\n\n\"I do what I can, day by day, to try and get by,\" remarked Allen Putnam, homeless in Buffalo.\n\n31-year-old Putman is among Buffalo's homeless population, who set up encampments at Firemen's Park in downtown Buffalo, an area bounded by South and North Division and Ellicott streets.\n\n\"Are you surprised at how many others are in the situation you're in?\" Buckley asked. \"I am surprised, yes. Everybody out here cares for each other. Like if anybody out here has an extra sandwich to give when somebody's hungry, they will give it away. We all look out for each other, but it's not ideal,\" replied Allen.\n\nAccording to the City Mission, 6,375 people right here in Western New York are facing homelessness.\n\nBut encampments, like one in downtown Buffalo these are a big concern for city leaders fearing it could harm the quality of life.\n\n\"Cleanliness, health -- is certainly a concern,\" declared Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown. \"Oftentimes, when these things occur, it can become unsanitary. It can create certain health situations that are concerning for the public.\"\n\nI caught up with Mayor Brown to ask him about the situation. He tells me the city is \"on top of it.\"\n\nMayor Brown also said the city and Buffalo police have repeatedly cleared out homeless encampments, but they keep returning. Brown noted some of the camps are set up on county or state property -- making it difficult for the city to keep up with this problem.\n\n\"I do pay close attention to it. I talked to the Buffalo Police Department, our behavioral health team, frequently. I talked to state and county about this issue, so we're all aware of it,\" Brown replied.\n\nYou may have also noted encampments under bridges throughout sections of Buffalo, under the 33 downtown, near the I-190, and along some areas of Michigan, Virginia, Tupper, and Exchange.\n\n\"There are housing options for people in the city. Some people choose to be un-housed.

Gavin Newsom last week directed state agencies to start clearing homeless encampments from public land, Cranston leaders took a first look at a measure that would bar tent dwellers from city land.\n\nEmboldened by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision validating an Oregon city's ban on outdoor sleeping, cities and towns throughout Rhode Island are grappling with how to address rising numbers of residents experiencing homelessness in the proliferation of tent encampments.\n\nThe Cranston City Council last week fielded an ordinance proposed by Mayor Ken Hopkins that would prohibit any type of \"shelter\" - permanent or temporary - on city land. Alleged offenders would face a $50 fine for trespassing and risk having their possessions discarded if they aren't removed within 24 hours.\n\nThe ordinance comes at the urging of Police Col. Michael J. Winquist, according to Anthony C. Moretti, the mayor's chief of staff.\n\nWinquist said in an email that the measure was prompted by complaints from residents about encampments on city property, and concerns about health and safety. The camps have sprung up across the city along a bike path, next to baseball fields and near highway ramps.\n\n\"I have personally been to various encampments that are littered with human waste, uncapped/used needles, syringes (some containing blood), alcohol containers, propane containers and property stolen from nearby businesses,\" Winquist said. \"There have also been complaints of criminal acts, including drug sales and prostitution.\"\n\n\"Sex offenders and persons with criminal backgrounds often reside at these locations, making women and children fearful of enjoying these public spaces that include ball fields and walking paths,\" he continued.\n\nWinquist recounted open fires and medical emergencies at encampments that were difficult for first responders to reach. Additionally, he cited the cost of cleaning up abandoned campsites, which requires hiring an outside vendor specializing in disposal of hazardous waste.\n\nAn outreach team of police officers, mental health clinicians and social service providers will reach out to offer assistance, but if people refuse to leave, Winquist said, they will receive a civil citation.\n\nThe proposal generated passionate blowback from residents and advocates for the unhoused community, many of whom referenced the city's unsuccessful effort to ban panhandling several years ago.\n\n\"This ordinance is brutal,\" Tom Wojcik told the City Council. \"We are not Americans if we don't treat each other respectfully. You don't find yourself sleeping on the road or in a park because you like it. You do it because of the circumstances in your life. It could happen to me, it could happen to all of us.\"\n\n\"Let's make this about people, about humanness, about kindness,\" he said.\n\nDeborah Flitman, a First Amendment activist who fought the panhandling ban, dismissed the encampment ordinance as immoral, inhumane and a violation of people's civil rights. Several people emphasized that the people who make their home in encampments are constituents.\n\n\"We as a city cannot be a part of criminalizing homelessness,\" Jessica Salter told the council. She urged city leaders to consider other ways to address astronomic housing costs, such as rent control or adding shelter beds.\n\nThe council voted to send the proposal to its Ordinance Committee for review, with Vice Chairperson Lammis J. Vargas and Councilor John P. Donegan voicing opposition.\n\nCouncilor Robert J. Ferri, a Democrat who is running against Hopkins for mayor, acknowledged that encampments are an issue for the state's second largest city. He emphasized that the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness reported there are 536 more people lacking a place to live in Rhode Island than there are available shelter beds. (The number has recently climbed beyond that.)\n\n\"I realize that people want swift action when a homeless encampment is discovered,\" Ferri said in an email. \"Writing an ordinance is really not the answer.\"\n\n\"Before we can break up an encampment, we must find a place to move the occupants and to protect their precious few belongings,\" Ferri continued. \"Simply put, we need more shelters and affordable housing.\"\n\nCranston, he said, hasn't build a single unit of \"affordable\" housing in more than 13 years. Instead of fining people experiencing homelessness, he said the city should be working with experts to address the issues.\n\n\"In Cranston, we are not doing our part,\" he said.\n\nBarbara Ann Fenton Fung, who has launched a Republican challenge to Hopkins, did not respond to repeated phone calls seeking comment.\n\nWest Warwick is also beginning to weigh what steps it might take.\n\n\"We're trying to take this relatively slowly. We're trying to address it as completely as we can to address all sides of the issue,\" Town Solicitor Timothy Williamson said.\n\nHe described the encampment population as a nomadic group that shifts locations - largely along the Pawtuxet River - when they wear out their welcome at a site.\n\n\"You can't stop what's happening,\" he said. \"The group is homeless for a lot of different reasons. It's a very difficult problem.\"\n\nHe viewed former Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt's move to dismantle encampments with little warning as a cautionary tale. In the aftermath, people - some of whom had been living at the site along the Blackstone River for a year - lost their few possessions, and advocates were left scrambling to find them shelter beds.\n\n\"We don't want to get in that type of position,\" Williamson said.\n\nCurrent Woonsocket Mayor Christopher Beauchamp did not respond to messages asking about his approach.\n\nElizabeth Tufts, a spokeswoman for Warwick Mayor Frank Picozzi, didn't reply to repeated inquiries about that city's position.\n\nOlivia DaRocha, a spokeswoman for Gov. Dan McKee, said she did not expect that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling would change the state's approach.\n\nAdvocates expressed fear that the U.S. Supreme Court decision will spur communities to take enforcement measures against encampments.\n\n\"It is deeply distressing to see some local municipalities in Rhode Island consider taking advantage of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent callous decision allowing for the criminalization of homelessness,\" said Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"Forcing homeless people to move when they have nowhere to go, destroying the little property they have and engaging in the surreal attempt to fine them when, almost by definition, they have no money, is a cruel, harmful and completely ineffective response to a serious societal problem.\"\n\n\"We are hopeful that Rhode Island communities will focus on compassion, not punishment, when they seek to address this critical issue,\" he said.\n\nThe ruling and Cranston's proposed ordinance come, too, as the number of people lacking shelter reached a high of 628 at the end of June, up from 534 in January, according to Eric Hirsch, interim chair of the Rhode Island Homeless Advocacy Project. There are 875 people on the shelter-bed waiting list and 1,011 on the waiting list for housing.\n\nHirsch faulted Mayor Hopkins' proposed ordinance for mirroring the Oregon approach given the nod by the high court. The court ruled that authorities in Grants Pass, Oregon, were free to ticket people for sleeping in public, even though the town had no available shelter beds or housing to provide to those living outdoors, he said.\n\n\"The problem is that neither Grants Pass nor Rhode Island municipalities have provided viable alternatives to those sleeping outside,\" Hirsch said. \"They usually claim to be providing shelter beds, housing units and wrap-around services but in fact are providing none of these.\"\n\nHe criticized police raids of encampments in Providence and elsewhere as serving only to scatter people to more dispersed and more hidden encampments where outreach workers often cannot find them.\n\n\"It should be obvious that ... the problems that neighbors of the unsheltered are experiencing are best solved by providing humane shelter and housing alternatives to those outside,\" Hirsch said.\n\nThe number of people without shelter is climbing, too, due to evictions, Hirsch said. According to the Rhode Island Housing dashboard, 3,871 households have been evicted in 2024, overwhelmingly due to the tenants' inability to pay skyrocketing rents.\n\nHirsch said these attitudes \"effectively criminalize homelessness,\" which is \"caused by a housing market that only serves the well-off.\"\n\nHe called on McKee to declare a state of emergency in the rising homeless numbers and for his administration to add additional shelter beds. He also implored municipal leaders to stop raiding encampments until residents have shelter.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Since April, this spot along Maintenance Trail has been the one legal place for people to camp. (Daniel Finsley | Finsley Creative for West Virginia Watch)\n\nIn West Virginia's gubernatorial race, candidates have seemingly differing views about how government should respond to homelessness.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that laws that prohibit homeless people from sleeping outside do not violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment, even when there are no shelter beds available.\n\nAdvocates for homeless people say the ruling could open the door to more states and cities criminalizing homelessness by enacting camping restrictions. Already, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered that state agencies remove homeless encampments from state parks, beaches, agency buildings, highways and the areas between them, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn West Virginia, a Morgantown councilwoman has suggested the city expand its camping ban.\n\nNationally, more than 650,000 are estimated to be homeless in the United States, the most since the country started doing point-in-time counts in 2007, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn West Virginia, the state Department of Human Services recently released a $373,000 study about homelessness. Senate Bill 239, passed during the 2023 legislative session, required the study to be completed and submitted to lawmakers for consideration of legislation relating to the homeless in the state.\n\nAsked whether he would sign a bill that legislated a statewide ban on camping in public, were one to come across his desk, Democratic candidate Steve Williams, the mayor of Huntington, said he believes in addressing the root causes of homelessness, not just the symptoms.\n\n\"While I understand the concerns about public safety and the use of public spaces, a statewide ban on public camping without providing adequate housing and support services would only criminalize our most vulnerable citizens,\" Williams said in an emailed statement. \"I would focus on expanding affordable housing, increasing access to mental health and addiction services, and creating comprehensive programs to help individuals transition out of homelessness.\n\n\"Addressing homelessness requires compassion, support and real solutions, not punitive measures,\" he said.\n\nThe city of Huntington does have a camping ban. Between April and mid July, the Huntington Police Department wrote nine citations for loitering, camping or trespassing to homeless people, according to the city's response to a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe campaign for Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the state's Republican gubernatorial candidate, did not respond to emails asking if Morrisey would support a statewide ban on camping.\n\nBut Morrisey, as the state's attorney general, did sign on to an amicus \"friend of the court\" brief on behalf of Grants Pass, the Oregon city at the heart of the Supreme Court ruling that enacted laws prohibiting people from sleeping in public.\n\nIn the court filing, the two dozen states argue that they are responsible for protecting the health and safety of all their residents, homeless or not, but the policies should not be up to federal governments.\n\n\"[States] sovereign duties also include defining crimes and enforcing a criminal code within their borders,\" they argue. \"They do not always approve of each other's policies on homelessness, much less the broader set of policies other States choose to pursue in their criminal codes. But they all agree these choices are theirs to make -- not the federal government's, and certainly not the federal courts'.\"\n\nIn an earlier statement to West Virginia Watch about the amicus brief, Morrisey said that local and state governments should have the power to select the solutions that work best for them.\n\n\"Instead, as we've pointed out in our amicus brief, decisions like Grants Pass effectively turn federal courts into homeless czars, stripping away traditional state authority over criminal law and making the problem worse,\" he said in the statement. \"As the brief said, that's the wrong approach -- this issue is a matter of local concern.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We've seen arrests, we've seen illegal confiscation of their property,\" said Friedenbach.\n\nOn July 25, the governor announced his executive order requiring state agencies to clear encampments on state land.\n\nThat order also encouraged cities to do the same. On Monday, almost 72 hours later, the amount of time required to give notice of the sweeps, sweeps in San Francisco started happening.\n\n\"They've done the Haight, around the DMV, they've done an area south of Market, they did an area here in the mission near Folsom and 16th-ish,\" said Friedenbach.\n\nKPIX went down to the DMV to check it out, and the encampment that had been there for months, if not years was gone. All that was left was the notice warning of the sweep stapled to a nearby tree.\n\nFriedenbach said she's worried the people being kicked out have nowhere to go.\n\n\"It's just kind of this forced march from place to place to place and because it's being done in such a harsh manner you know people get really upset and they're further destabilized. They lose all their survival gear. They're of course very devastated by that,\" said Friedenbach.\n\nThe city claims it has no other choice. They said over 2/3rds of the homeless refuse shelter or services.\n\nUnder these new rules, the city is still offering shelter to those being swept but if people refuse, the city doesn't have to re-offer shelter the next time that person is kicked out of an encampment.\n\nFriedenbach said she doesn't believe that approach will solve anything.\n\n\"None of those actions have decreased homelessness. In fact study show that these kind of operations exacerbate homelessness and make it worse,\" said Friedenbach.\n\nFor now though, the city is sticking to the approach. They've scheduled about three encampment sweeps each day this week and plan to also target smaller encampments on a daily basis.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_motor_vehicles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of motor vehicles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPIX-TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KPIX-TV"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/31/4c64e226-5d69-4ba2-a5de-99a202d4fa33/thumbnail/1200x630/1e96e83a13f5d4c33a40db7f77176b3b/snapshot-10.jpg?v=8f1da8ceea4c14a7119ef5d6a2829966", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774802", "eventUri": "eng-9774802", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 377, "textEnd": 384}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

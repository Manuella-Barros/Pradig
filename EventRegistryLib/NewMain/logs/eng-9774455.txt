In his letter, Diwase flagged several demands made by Khedkar during her probation, which were deemed inappropriate and beyond her entitlement.\n\nAlso read: Three Students Dead After Delhi Coaching Center Basement Floods In Old Rajender Nagar: Investigation Underway Amid Protests\n\nThis complaint triggered a thorough investigation that unearthed further troubling details. Questions arose regarding how Khedkar managed to clear the rigorous selection process of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). It was discovered that she had availed herself of relaxations meant for physical disability and OBC candidacy. However, allegations surfaced suggesting that she might not have been eligible for these relaxations.\n\nKhedkar now faces a criminal case for \"misrepresenting and falsifying facts\" in her application for civil service. The UPSC has issued a show-cause notice to potentially cancel her selection, and she may be barred from retaking the examination. Concurrently, the Delhi Police have filed a case against her, and an investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe controversy extends to Khedkar's family as well. Her father, Dilip Khedkar, a former Maharashtra government officer, is currently embroiled in a corruption case and has faced suspension twice in the past for related charges, including extortion. Additionally, her mother, Manorama Khedkar, who serves as a sarpanch, has found herself in legal trouble after a video surfaced showing her brandishing a gun and threatening a group of people.

The UPSC granted her time till July 30 and made it clear that it was the \"final opportunity\" and \"no further extension in time\" would be allowed.\n\nShe was also told that if no response is received by the deadline, UPSC would take action. \"Despite extension in time allowed to her, she failed to submit her explanation within the prescribed time,\" the panel has said in the statement.\n\n\"The UPSC has examined the available records carefully and found her guilty of acting in contravention of the provisions of the CSE-2022 Rules.

The UPSC is in the process of further strengthening the SOP to ensure that such a case does not recur in the future,\" the statement added.\n\nThe UPSC clarified that it carries out \"only a preliminary scrutiny of the certificates\" of candidates. \"Generally, the certificate is taken as genuine, if it has been issued by the competent authority. The UPSC neither has the mandate nor the wherewithal to check the veracity of thousands of certificates submitted by the candidates every year. However, it is understood that scrutiny and verification of genuineness of certificates is carried out by the authorities mandate with the task,\" it added.\n\nThe Undoing Of Puja Khedkar\n\nPuja Khedkar's troubles began in June when Pune Collector Suhas Diwase wrote to Maharashtra Chief Secretary Sujata Saunik, flagging the trainee IAS officer's demands for perks such as a car, staff and an office that she was not entitled to during her two-year probation.

The notice, sent on July 26 via email and post, stems from inquiries conducted by multiple agencies. Khedkar has been given seven days to provide her explanation either in person at the DoPT or in writing.\n\nAccording to a report by TOI, DoPT officials emphasized that the notice follows standard procedures and grants Khedkar the option to choose her method of response. Should she fail to meet the deadline, further action will be considered. A single-member panel has been appointed by the central government to verify Khedkar's candidature claims and other details based on a report from the Maharashtra government. If Khedkar is found guilty of making false claims, she could face termination from service.\n\nThe Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) lodged a complaint, prompting the Delhi Police's crime branch to register a case of cheating, fraud, and forgery against Khedkar. The single-member committee has already submitted its findings to the DoPT secretary, and a DoPT team is currently reviewing the report to determine the appropriate action.\n\nKhedkar was scheduled to report to the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in Mussoorie by July 23, following her district training program in Washim, Maharashtra. However, officials confirmed that she has not yet reported to the academy.\n\nPune's Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime), Shailesh Balkawade, stated that the Delhi police crime branch has not requested assistance or information regarding the cheating and forgery case registered by the UPSC against Khedkar.\n\nKhedkar's anticipatory bail plea is set to be heard today by Delhi's Patiala House Court. The UPSC, through private counsel, and the crime branch, which is gathering documents from various government departments, have both opposed her bail application.

In response, the UPSC is working to further strengthen its SOPs to prevent such incidents in the future.\n\nThe UPSC clarified that it performs only a preliminary scrutiny of the candidates' certificates, generally accepting them as genuine if issued by a competent authority.

I wrote 5 but I should have said 12,\" she said.\n\nBoth Delhi Police and UPSC argued that custodial interrogation was required as the matter had to be investigated seriously as Khedkar had \"breached the integrity of the system.\"\n\nHowever, the counsel representing the UPSC contested the claim. \"There was no adjudication by the High Court that she is eligible to sit for the additional exams,\" the court was informed by the counsel representing UPSC.\n\nAdditional Public Prosecutor Atul Srivastava, appearing for the Delhi Police, said Khedkar had intentionally changed her name to dupe the UPSC and that she had not informed anyone about the number of attempts she gave. \"Is this not a serious concealment of facts?\" asked Srivastava.\n\n\"The act of suppression took place at every instance - before the DoPT, UPSC, and Courts. This person has abused the law and process of law. The chances of her abusing the law are still there. She is a resourceful person,\" said Senior Advocate Naresh Kaushik representing the UPSC.\n\nSrivastava, on the other hand, alleged that Khedkar claimed that her parents were divorced to overcome the hurdle of creamy layer exclusion that exists under the OBC Category.\n\nThe court, however, questioned the need to arrest Khedkar at this stage and asked the prosecution whether the case was one of forgery of documents. \"If your investigation is at a nascent stage, then why are you in such a hurry to arrest her?\" asked ASJ Jangala.\n\nThe court also pulled up UPSC. \"Is it the failure of UPSC to allow this to happen or the over-expertise of the applicant?\" the court asked Kaushik.\n\nWhile opposing her bail plea, Srivastava also said that Khedkar would not cooperate with the police if she is granted anticipatory bail.\n\nThe court reserved the order on her anticipatory bail plea.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nirbhay_thakur@indianexpress.com", "name": "Nirbhay Thakur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Institutes_of_Medical_Sciences", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All India Institutes of Medical Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjudication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adjudication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interrogation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Disability_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Disability Studies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/puja-khedkar-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774455", "eventUri": "eng-9774455", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

When applying for her disability certificate, Puja Khedkar informed the doctors at YCM Hospital about a minor accident in 2018 that injured her left knee. However, according to exclusive documents obtained by India Today, no medical records from that year were reviewed, and no MRI scan was conducted during her examination.\n\nOn August 23, 2022, Khedkar visited YCM Hospital to obtain a disability certificate, using address proof that was later discovered to be fraudulent and from a fake ration card. Earlier, on July 25, Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) Hospital in Pune conducted an internal investigation and found no misconduct in the issuance of the seven per cent locomotor disability certificate to Puja Khedkar.\n\nRajendra Wable, dean of YCM Hospital, said, \"The internal report confirmed that the certificate was issued after a comprehensive evaluation by our physiotherapy and orthopaedic departments, and all medical tests were conducted according to regulations.

Once a relatively unknown figure, Kokat's expos\u00e9 has set off a firestorm of controversy surrounding the integrity of the UPSC selection process.\n\nVaibhav Kokat, a former PR professional and a resident of Beed district in Maharashtra, is known for his vocal stance on social and political issues. His active presence on X (formerly Twitter) has garnered him around 30,000 followers, but it was one particular post that drove him into the national limelight. Kokat's tweet pointed to alleged irregularities in Khedkar's selection process, raising serious questions about the practices of both central and state administrations.\n\nThe tweet revealed that Puja Khedkar, whose father is a retired IAS officer, allegedly used fraudulent disability certificates to pass the UPSC exam and secure her position. This claim has opened a Pandora's box, sparking debates about the credibility and transparency of India's civil service examinations.\n\nReports further state that Khedkar was found using unauthorised blue and amber lights on her private Audi car, which has now been seized by Pune Police. Violating the Motor Vehicles Act, she also had a red and blue beacon and a VIP number plate, with 'Maharashtra Government' illegally inscribed on the car. The vehicle was fined Rs 26,000 for 21 traffic violations, adding fuel to the already blazing controversy.\n\nKokat's revelations have prompted a broader discussion about systemic issues within the UPSC selection process and the effectiveness of state administrations. The case of Puja Khedkar has not only highlighted potential loopholes but has also raised alarms about the integrity of future civil servants.\n\nThe Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has now taken decisive action, cancelling Khedkar's selection as a trainee IAS officer and barring her from future entrance exams. The UPSC's statement revealed that Khedkar had fraudulently attempted the exam beyond the permissible limit by falsifying her identity, leading to her disqualification.\n\nAs the debate rages on, the focus remains on ensuring that such anomalies are addressed, and the sanctity of the UPSC examination process is upheld.

Upon examining the available records, UPSC found her guilty of violating the provisions of the CSE-2022 Rules.\n\nIn light of this case, UPSC has conducted a thorough review of the data of more than 15,000 finally recommended candidates of the Civil Services Examinations from 2009 to 2023 to verify the number of attempts availed by them. This comprehensive exercise revealed no other candidate exceeding the permitted number of attempts under the CSE Rules, except for Khedkar.

She is also accused of improperly availing the OBC and non-creamy layer quota in the UPSC exam.\n\nFollowing these allegations, her probation period was put on hold, and she was recalled to the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand.\n\n(More to come)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puja_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Puja (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Bahadur_Shastri_National_Academy_of_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Services_Examination_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil Services Examination (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pune district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussoorie", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mussoorie"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mussoorie"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washim", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112165640,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-29490,overlay-etcareers/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774455", "eventUri": "eng-9774455", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

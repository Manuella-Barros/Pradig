The Dutchman's future as manager looked uncertain at the end of last season after a disappointing campaign when the club finished eighth, their worst performance in the Premier League.\n\nUnited, however, went on to win the FA Cup final against Manchester City, earning a second piece of silverware in two years under Ten Hag and guaranteeing qualification for the Europa League. That resulted in the club triggering a one-year extension from his original deal that was due to run until 2025.\n\nThe extension is a vote of confidence in Ten Hag from Ratcliffe who commissioned a full analysis of United's football department as he looked for improvements. The club spoke to potential replacements, including Thomas Tuchel, but decided to stick with Ten Hag who is looking into refreshing his backroom staff, with the former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and Dutch coach Ren\u00e9 Hake under consideration.\n\n\"I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together. Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined,\" Ten Hag said.\n\n\"However, we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead to reach the levels expected of Manchester United, which means challenging for English and European titles.

Despite a difficult second season, Ten Hag's victories, including an FA Cup win, have solidified his position. The club is committed to achieving domestic and European successes under his guidance.\n\nErik ten Hag has signed a new contract with Manchester United to extend his stay at Old Trafford until 2026, the Premier League club said on Thursday as the Dutchman gets another chance to restore the record 20-times champions to former glories. There had been speculation he would be sacked after United ended eighth last season -- their lowest ever finish in the Premier League -- and with British billionaire and INEOS chairman Jim Ratcliffe taking charge of football operations.\n\nA shock victory over champions Manchester City in the FA Cup final, however, earned the 54-year-old Ten Hag a lifeline, \"Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"We must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead to reach the levels expected of Manchester United, which means challenging for English and European titles. \"In my discussions with the club, we have found complete unity in our vision for reaching those goals, and we are strongly committed to making that journey together.\"\n\nTen Hag's contract had been set to expire at the end of the 2024-25 season but denying Manchester City a domestic double and qualifying for the Europa League earned him another chance. \"With two trophies in the past two seasons, Erik has reinforced his record as one of the most consistently successful coaches in European football,\" the club's Sporting Director Dan Ashworth said in a statement.\n\n\"While the club's review of last season highlighted areas of improvement, it also reached a clear conclusion that Erik was the best partner for us to work with in driving up standards and outcomes. \"This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing at the top level; now they have to do it more consistently.\"\n\nDespite winning two trophies, results and performances have fallen away dramatically despite more than 400 million pounds being spent on new players since Ten Hag took charge. United struggled early in his first season, but Ten Hag instilled a sense of togetherness that had been missing since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\n\nThey enjoyed a nine-match winning run in all competitions, lifting the League Cup and finishing third in the Premier League. The second season was much worse but United's fan base largely stayed loyal to Ten Hag and sung his name loudly at Wembley in the Cup final as their team produced the best performance of his spell in charge.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017\u201318_Manchester_City_F.C._season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2017\u201318 Manchester City F.C. season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/10_05_2024_23_21_47_6022178.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706156", "eventUri": "eng-9706156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

However, after an end-of-season review, the decision was made to stick with Ten Hag and extend his contract.\n\nFocus will now turn to the summer transfer window and pre-season, which will see United take on Rosenborg, Rangers, Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool. There is hope that the club can improve on last season's disappointing league campaign and new sporting director, Dan Ashworth, has set a simple target.\n\nSpeaking after Ten Hag's contract extension, he said: \"With two trophies in the past two seasons, Erik has reinforced his record as one of the most consistently successful coaches in European football.\n\n\"While the club's review of last season highlighted areas for improvement, it also reached a clear conclusion that Erik was the best partner for us to work with in driving up standards and outcomes.\n\n\"This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently.\n\n\"With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.\"\n\nAfter two up-and-down seasons at Old Trafford, it could not be clearer what Ineos now want of Ten Hag as the club seek the consistency to challenge at the top end of the Premier League table.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenborg_BK", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rosenborg BK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Betis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Betis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/manchester_evening_news_792/b32407587efe7d6708fc53cfd12eeb14", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706156", "eventUri": "eng-9706156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

A notable victory in the FA Cup and a unified vision with the club's management played critical roles in his continued tenure. Ten Hag aims to restore the club's former glories.\n\nErik ten Hag has signed a new contract with Manchester United to extend his stay at Old Trafford until 2026, the Premier League club said on Thursday as the Dutchman gets another chance to restore the record 20-times champions to former glories. There had been speculation he would be sacked after United ended eighth last season -- their lowest ever finish in the Premier League -- and with British billionaire and INEOS chairman Jim Ratcliffe taking charge of football operations.\n\nA shock victory over champions Manchester City in the FA Cup final, however, earned the 54-year-old Ten Hag a lifeline, \"Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"We must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead to reach the levels expected of Manchester United, which means challenging for English and European titles. \"In my discussions with the club, we have found complete unity in our vision for reaching those goals, and we are strongly committed to making that journey together.\"\n\nTen Hag's contract had been set to expire at the end of the 2024-25 season but denying Manchester City a domestic double and qualifying for the Europa League earned him another chance. \"With two trophies in the past two seasons, Erik has reinforced his record as one of the most consistently successful coaches in European football,\" the club's Sporting Director Dan Ashworth said in a statement.\n\n\"While the club's review of last season highlighted areas of improvement, it also reached a clear conclusion that Erik was the best partner for us to work with in driving up standards and outcomes. \"This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing at the top level; now they have to do it more consistently.\"\n\nDespite winning two trophies, results and performances have fallen away dramatically despite more than 400 million pounds being spent on new players since Ten Hag took charge. United struggled early in his first season, but Ten Hag instilled a sense of togetherness that had been missing since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\n\nThey enjoyed a nine-match winning run in all competitions, lifting the League Cup and finishing third in the Premier League. The second season was much worse but United's fan base largely stayed loyal to Ten Hag and sung his name loudly at Wembley in the Cup final as their team produced the best performance of his spell in charge.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017\u201318_Manchester_City_F.C._season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2017\u201318 Manchester City F.C. season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/10_05_2024_23_21_47_6022178.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706156", "eventUri": "eng-9706156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

final position since 1990 -- and crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage.\n\nThere were reports that Ten Hag would be sacked regardless of the result in the FA Cup final at Wembley but

With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.\"\n\nTen Hag has won the League Cup and FA Cup in his first two seasons in charge but oversaw a dreadful campaign for United last season as they finished eighth in the Premier League. However, their FA Cup final win against Manchester City booked them a spot in the Europa League group stage and made sure that Ten Hag added a second trophy to the League Cup he won in his debut season in charge in the 2022-23 campaign.\n\nSpeaking about extending his stay at United, this is what Erik ten Hag had to say:\n\n\"I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together. Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined,\" Ten Hag said.\n\n\"However, we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead to reach the levels expected of Manchester United, which means challenging for English and European titles. In my discussions with the club, we have found complete unity in our vision for reaching those goals, and we are all strongly committed to making that journey together.\"\n\nTime will tell but it is certainly a safe decision and gives ETH the benefit of the doubt that with a total new structure, rising stars like Garnacho, Hojlund and Mainoo who has nurtured expertly, some key new players and hopefully for his and United's sake better luck with injuries, he can kick them on and be a top four team once again.\n\nLast season may have just been a freak campaign and Ten Hag could point to his debut season in charge when he reached two cup finals (winning the League Cup) and finishing in third place as a true reflection of what he can do. But the way his side played for most of last season was shambolic as defensive injuries hit them hard and they were often overpowered and dominated, even in games they ended up winning.\n\nFor the upcoming season, if United can keep Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez fit, plus add a holding midfielder, striker and a center back in the transfer window, they should be right up there in the top four hunt.\n\nWith all of the changes behind-the-scenes at United put in place by INEOS, things will take time to start heading in a positive direction.\n\nThe fact Erik ten Hag has been handed the keys to coach the team for their first full season in charge of football operations at Old Trafford is a huge show of faith and now he has to prove that last season was a one-off and usher in an attractive style of play while getting results with a talented young team.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Wilcox", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Wilcox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Garnacho", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Garnacho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/962e7af/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4783x2690+0+277/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F07%2F9285d15c4d958678be6cfbd734ae%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2154992725", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706156", "eventUri": "eng-9706156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

If the Dutchman keeps his job - and most fans would like him too - he's still got a tough one on his hands. PA\n\nErik ten Hag's Manchester United future has finally been resolved after he signed a contract extension until 2026 with the Premier League club.\n\nThe Dutch manager's future had been under scrutiny after United finished eighth in the league and failed to make it through to the Champions League knockout stage - even missing out on the consolation of Europa League football after finishing bottom of their group.\n\nReports in the UK suggested Ten Hag was set to be sacked in the summer with a year left on his contract, but United defeated Manchester City in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium, denying their local rivals a double, which has proven vital to the 54-year-old keeping his job.\n\n\"I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together,\" Ten Hag told the club's website. \"Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined.\n\n\"However, we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead to reach the levels expected of Manchester United, which means challenging for English and European titles.\n\n\"In my discussions with the club, we have found complete unity in our vision for reaching those goals, and we are all strongly committed to making that journey together.\"\n\nTen Hag moved to the Old Trafford club from Dutch side Ajax and guided United to victory in the League Cup final over Newcastle United - the Red Devils first trophy in six years - and a third-place finish in the Premier League.\n\nHis second campaign proved far more problematic as United fell to their lowest league position since 1990 but a performance review - led by co-owner Jim Ratcliffe following the British billionaire's investment last December - took place at the end of the campaign and, in light of the FA Cup triumph, it was determined Ten Hag should remain in charge.\n\nThe new deal is not a full refresh of Ten Hag's contract terms but extends his existing agreement by 12 months.\n\nConfirmation comes in the same week that Dan Ashworth was finally appointed as United's new sporting director after months of negotiations with his previous employers Newcastle, with Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada and Dave Brailsford having already joined in senior roles.\n\nReports suggest former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy is set to return to Old Trafford as part of a revamped coaching set-up alongside Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake.\n\n\"With two trophies in the past two seasons, Erik has reinforced his record as one of the most consistently successful coaches in European football,\" said Ashworth.\n\n\"While the club's review of last season highlighted areas for improvement, it also reached a clear conclusion that Erik was the best partner for us to work with in driving up standards and outcomes.\n\n\"This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level - now we need to do it more consistently.\n\n\"With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.\"\n\nTen Hag is United's fifth permanent manager since the end of the Alex Ferguson era in 2013, following David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nTen Hag's men face Manchester City in the Community Shield on August 10 before starting their 2024/25 Premier League campaign at home to Fulham six days later.

In his first season, he guided United to a third-place finish in the Premier League and secured the Carabao Cup. Although the second season saw the team finish 8th, they ended on a high note with a victory over Manchester City in the FA Cup final.\n\nNew sporting director Dan Ashworth added, \"With two trophies in the past two seasons, Erik has reinforced his record as one of the most consistently successful coaches in European football.\"\n\n\"While the club's review of last season highlighted areas for improvement, it also reached a clear conclusion that Erik was the best partner for us to work with in driving up standards and outcomes. This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently. With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club,\" Ashworth added.\n\nAdditionally, United legend Ruud van Nistelrooy has been tipped to join ten Hag's backroom staff this summer, further bolstering the coaching team as they aim to bring more success to Old Trafford.\n\nThe extension of ten Hag's contract signals Manchester United's intent to build on recent successes and strive for higher achievements in both domestic and European competitions. Fans will be eagerly anticipating the upcoming season as ten Hag and his team continue their pursuit of glory.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruud_van_Nistelrooy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruud van Nistelrooy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01gpjxxfgpqs01v823hmwnmc32/whatsapp-image-2023-01-12-at-17-25-56.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706156", "eventUri": "eng-9706156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

New co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe conducted a detailed review into his position and even spoke to potential replacements, with Thomas Tuchel among the candidates.\n\nBut Ratcliffe eventually chose to leave Ten Hag in situ at Old Trafford following the club's FA Cup success against rivals Manchester City at Wembley. That made it two trophies in two seasons for the Dutchman, and he has been rewarded with a new contract.\n\nThe former Ajax boss' deal will now run until the summer of 2026. He said: \"I am very pleased to have reached agreement with the club to continue working together.\n\n\"Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined. However, we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead to reach the levels expected of Manchester United, which means challenging for English and European titles.\n\n\"In my discussions with the club, we have found complete unity in our vision for reaching those goals, and we are all strongly committed to making that journey together.\"\n\nWhile Ten Hag remains, there have been alterations to his backroom staff. Former Red Devils striker Ruud van Nistelrooy is returning to the club as a coach alongside his compatriot, having spurned the interest of Championship side Burnley. Van Nistelrooy held two rounds of talks to replace Vincent Kompany at Turf Moor, but elected to return to Old Trafford instead. Go Ahead Eagles manager Rene Hake is also joining as an assistant head coach too.\n\nOne member of Ten Hag's staff that is on the way out is Benni McCarthy. His contract expired this summer and he has departed to pursue his own managerial career.\n\nWho should Man United sign this summer? Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\nTen Hag is under no illusions that he will need to improve on the club's fortunes next term after a grossly underwhelming Premier League campaign. They slumped to eighth, losing 14 games in the process.\n\nTen Hag's deal comes after new sporting director Dan Ashworth finally arrived at the club earlier this week from Newcastle. It's believed United paid \u00a312million to end his gardening leave and finally get him through the door.\n\nAshworth, United's newly-appointed sporting director, said: \"With two trophies in the past two seasons, Erik has reinforced his record as one of the most consistently successful coaches in European football.\n\n\"While the club's review of last season highlighted areas for improvement, it also reached a clear conclusion that Erik was the best partner for us to work with in driving up standards and outcomes. This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level. Nnow we need to do it more consistently.\n\n\"With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruud_van_Nistelrooy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruud van Nistelrooy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ashworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Ashworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McClaren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve McClaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Wilcox", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Wilcox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Floorball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Floorball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/04/16/86927671-0-image-m-49_1720107246063.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706156", "eventUri": "eng-9706156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The Dutchman's previous deal was due to expire at the end of next season but the club had the option for an additional year that they have activated.\n\nTen Hag had seemed likely to leave United at the end of last season until the 2-1 FA Cup final win over Manchester City. The Red Devils have now won two trophies since Ten Hag took over at Old Trafford after the League Cup success in 2023.\n\nHowever, after finishing third in the Premier League in his first season, Ten Hag's side plummeted to eighth last term - their worst finish in 34 years.\n\nREAD MORE: Manchester United confirm Erik ten Hag contract extension\n\nREAD MORE: Man United 'extremely confident' of key signing with \u00a385m star's transfer a 'strong possibility'\n\nIt had appeared as though Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos were going to replace the Dutchman for the 2024/25 season. However, after an end-of-season review, the decision was made to stick with Ten Hag and extend his contract.\n\nFocus will now turn to the summer transfer window and pre-season, which will see United take on Rosenborg, Rangers, Arsenal, Real Betis and Liverpool. There is hope that the club can improve on last season's disappointing league campaign and new sporting director, Dan Ashworth, has set a simple target.\n\nSpeaking after Ten Hag's contract extension, he said: \"With two trophies in the past two seasons, Erik has reinforced his record as one of the most consistently successful coaches in European football.\n\n\"While the club's review of last season highlighted areas for improvement, it also reached a clear conclusion that Erik was the best partner for us to work with in driving up standards and outcomes.\n\n\"This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently.\n\n\"With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.\"\n\nAfter two up-and-down seasons at Old Trafford, it could not be clearer what Ineos now want of Ten Hag as the club seek the consistency to challenge at the top end of the Premier League table.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

This decision comes after a challenging season where United finished eighth in the Premier League but ended on a high note by winning the FA Cup against Manchester City.\n\nDespite the contract extension, some see the additional 12 months as a modest show of confidence since his existing contract was set to expire in 2025. Ten Hag expressed his satisfaction with the new agreement, highlighting the progress made over the past two years with two trophies and significant improvements in the team's performance.\n\nErik Ten Hag's vision for Manchester United's future\n\nTen Hag is clear about the challenges ahead. He emphasized the need for continued hard work to meet Manchester United's high expectations, which include competing for English and European titles. The club and Ten Hag share a unified vision for the future and are strongly committed to achieving their goals together.\n\nNew sporting director Dan Ashworth praised Ten Hag's achievements, noting his consistent success as one of Europe's top coaches. Despite areas for improvement identified in last season's review, Ashworth believes Ten Hag is the best person to drive Manchester United forward. The club aims to build on its successes and strive for more consistent performances at the highest level.\n\nManchester United's management, including new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, considered several replacements for Ten Hag before deciding to stick with the Dutchman. Candidates included Thomas Tuchel, who declined the offer, England manager Gareth Southgate, and former Chelsea coach Mauricio Pochettino. Other names mentioned were Kieran McKenna, Ruben Amorim, Roberto De Zerbi, Thomas Frank, Marco Silva, and Roberto Martinez. Ultimately, United chose to continue with Ten Hag, who has won 66 out of 114 games since joining the club two years ago.\n\nAfter winning the FA Cup, Ten Hag made a strong statement about his future, expressing his determination to win trophies wherever he goes. United's victory at Wembley secured their place in the Europa League for the upcoming season, a notable achievement after being knocked out of the Champions League group stage in the previous campaign.\n\nLooking ahead, Manchester United's squad is set for significant changes this summer. Raphael Varane, Anthony Martial, and Brandon Williams have already been released, while Sofyan Amrabat has returned to Fiorentina after his loan spell. Additionally, reports suggest that Marcus Rashford could be sold for \u00a380 million.\n\nUnited are targeting several new signings, including Everton center-back Jarrad Branthwaite, Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee, and Bayern Munich defender Matthijs de Ligt. These potential acquisitions aim to strengthen the squad and support Ten Hag's tactical plans for the 2024/25 season.\n\nManchester United will kick off their new Premier League campaign by hosting Fulham on August 16. Following that, they will travel to Brighton and then host Liverpool before the first international break. These early fixtures will be crucial in setting the tone for the season and demonstrating the progress made under Ten Hag's leadership.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news",

Speculation had continued to linger after the Red Devils finished 8th in the Premier League last season but INEOS have stuck with their man.\n\nTen Hag, 54, was rumoured to be on the way out of Old Trafford despite the result of the 2024 FA Cup final but Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford have laid down a marker that the former Ajax boss is firmly part of their plans moving forward.\n\nWATCH | Why Spain Have The PERFECT System To Win The Euros\n\nAs confirmed via the club on Thursday, Ten Hag has penned fresh terms with the club that will see him remain at the Theatre of Dreams until at least 2026. Speaking following the announcement, the Manchester United boss insisted he is keen to continue making progress during an important period for everyone involved at Old Trafford.\n\nErik ten Hag said: \"I am very pleased to have reached [an] agreement with the club to continue working together. Looking back at the past two years, we can reflect with pride on two trophies and many examples of progression from where we were when I joined.\n\n\"However, we must also be clear that there is still lots of hard work ahead to reach the levels expected of Manchester United, which means challenging for English and European titles.\n\n\"In my discussions with the club, we have found complete unity in our vision for reaching those goals, and we are all strongly committed to making that journey together.\"\n\nWhilst Ten Hag's season in the Premier League may not have gone to plan, INEOS bosses have, in our opinion, made the correct call.

The fiasco started after Manchester United lost 4-0 to Crystal Palace in the Premier League fixture. Rumours started to spread like wildfire that the former Ajax manager was counting his days in Manchester. However, their win against Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals and their city rivals, Manchester City, in the FA Cup final changed the scenario within the club.\n\nEven though reports suggested that Ten Hag would get terminated, Sir Jim Ratcliffe openly praised Ten Hag and announced indirectly that the club is looking forward to continuing under the Dutch manager.\n\nHence, the news has finally been made official by the Manchester United social media handles that Erik Ten Hag will continue to lead the Red Devils.\n\nDespite the news, Erik Ten Hag must find a way to turn the club's fortunes next season or it will look troubling for the manager. Under his guidance and opinion, Manchester United took the side of their manager in the dramatic Ronaldo-Ten Hag fiasco, signed players at inflated prices, and changed the philosophy at the club. However, the results didn't reflect the management's trust in Ten Hag.\n\nManchester United finished 8 in the Premier League table, winning 18, drawing 6, and losing 14 matches. Considering the hype and prospects of the club, this was an underwhelming season. They failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League but made it to the competition next season by winning the FA Cup. Marquee signings like Antony, Casemiro, and Hojlund found life hard at the club.\n\nThe signings barely helped United to become better on the field. Poor performances and staggering losses put pressure on Ten Hag's job last season. However, one can say that this is still a learning and transitional phase for the rebuilding of the team under Ten Hag.\n\nHowever, pundits and fans have agreed that anything less than a direct UCL qualification will be disastrous to the club. Sir Jim Ratcliffe is currently reforming various sections of the club alongside Ten Hag, and trying to create a positive and competitive \"environment\" in the club dynamics.\n\nHence, Erik Ten Hag must repay the faith put upon him by the INEOS management.\n\nThe second season saw a sudden shift in game approach, formation, and philosophy. Ten Hag tried a pragmatic approach, rotating 4-2-2-2?4-3-3-?4-2-3-1 formation frequently. However, the constant rotation hindered cohesiveness on the field. The idea was to play the available players in their suited roles, hence the frequent shift in formations and tactics.\n\nHowever, continuity is an important factor, and Ten Hag overlooked such problems. Due to that, most players underperformed and looked clueless on the field several times. A player requires a certain period to settle into a system, and most were told to settle into three or more systems together. Ten Hag and Sir Jim Ratcliffe must fix this troubling factor together to create a cohesive unit.\n\nOnce the philosophy and approach are finalised, newly signed Sporting Director, Dan Ashworth, and Ten Hag must find the most compatible players for the approach. Certain players struggle to fit in an alienating system and fail to fulfill their potential. Hence, after the fumble with Antony, Casemiro, Sancho, and Hojlund, Manchester United must look for players suited to \"Ten-Hag ball'. The club requires investment in certain areas including, centre back, left back, defensive midfielder, right winger, and striker. Investing in properly scouted individuals will be vital for Ten Hag's evaluation next season.\n\nThe management's patience is limiting for the Dutch manager. Erik Ten Hag must challenge clubs like Manchester City and Arsenal for the top spot.

Three weeks after the end of the season, United informed Ten Hag of their decision to keep him after well-documented talks with potential replacements. After an internal review, Old Trafford chiefs decided to stick with Ten Hag despite constant speculation over his future but new United sporting director Dan Ashworth explained the decision in a statement today. It read: \"With two trophies in the past two seasons, Erik has reinforced his record as one of the most consistently successful coaches in European football. \"While the club's review of last season highlighted areas for improvement, it also reached a clear conclusion that Erik was the best partner for us to work with in driving up standards and outcomes.\"\n\nThe 54-year-old led United to their worst ever Premier League finish in 8th place but they secured Europa League qualification for next season by winning the FA Cup. It was reported before that final that Ten Hag would be sacked regardless of the result but the shock triumph over rivals Manchester City reaffirmed the United support's backing of Ten Hag. It's widely accepted that an overhaul of United's squad is required this summer but what does Ten Hag need to improve as he enters his third season in charge?\n\nTen Hag's maiden season in England was an unquestionable success after arriving from Ajax. The Dutch boss inherited an unbalanced squad that had recorded United's lowest ever point tally in Premier League history under Ralf Rangnick. Ten Hag wasn't afraid to make big decisions as he got rid of Cristiano Ronaldo and United finished third to secure Champions League football and they won their first silverware in six years with the League Cup.\n\nHowever, as the graphic above illustrates, United endured a huge downturn in form and performance levels in Ten Hag's second season in charge. His points per game record dropped from 2.16 to 1.63 and United finished with a negative goal difference in the league last season. United also lost seven more games last season than in Ten Hag's maiden season despite playing ten fewer games and they only won 50% of their games in all competitions, compared to 68% during the 2022/23 campaign. While United were decimated by defensive injuries, Ten Hag's stubborn commitment to playing transitional football left them completely exposed defensively and only Luton and Sheffield United faced more shots in the league (444). They also finished bottom of their Champions League group behind Galatasary and Copenhagen and he must produce better results in Europe next season.\n\nLots. United struggled to score goals last season while their terrible defensive record was alarming. They scored the joint-fewest goals (57) amongst the teams who finished in the top half of the league and there was an over-reliance on Rasmus H\u00f8jlund. The youngster was United's only recognisable senior striker with Anthony Martial constantly unavailable and it was a huge burden on Hojlund during his first season in England. The 58 goals that United conceded was the most that they've lost in a single Premier League season. Injuries were a major factor as Ten Hag was constantly forced to shuffle his defence, naming over 20 different back four combinations. Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez missed the majority of the campaign and United must sign a first-choice centre-back to partner Martinez with Rapha\u00ebl Varane departing. INEOS - fronted by Ratcliffe - gained sporting control of United in March and it's imperative they improve the transfer record at Old Trafford as recruitment has been a major issue across the last decade. United have more freedom than in previous seasons in the market but they will still be restricted by financial regulations and offloading players will be a necessity.\n\nTransfermarkt recently analysed 13 players who could be viewed as surplus to requirements and some high-profile players like Casemiro, Jadon Sancho and Harry Maguire could leave. A new centre-back, centre-forward and midfielder are United's priorities this summer and there will be an onus on developing younger talents like Amad, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo. It's understood that Ten Hag's impressive record in successfully integrating academy talents into the first-team was significant in INEOS' decision to keep him as manager and was another positive.\n\nThe decision to keep Ten Hag has split opinion but he enjoyed significant support from the United fanbase. There wasn't a standout candidate to replace the Dutchman and ultimately, United sounded out other candidates and decided Ten Hag represented the best option. Finishing 8th in the Premier League is unacceptable for a club of United's stature and there must be a drastic improvement in performance levels despite mitigating factors behind the underperformance last season. Ten Hag was unwilling to adapt his philosophy until the last few weeks of the season and it proved rewarding as his tactical masterclass against Man City in the FA Cup final showed.\n\nAfter the game, Ten Hag bullishly stated: \"Two trophies in two seasons and three finals... not bad. If they don't want me anymore, I'll go somewhere else and win trophies. That's what I do\". There is substance to Ten Hag's comments as he's won a trophy in his last seven seasons across his tenures at Ajax and United. As the graphic above illustrates, Ten Hag's record of winning trophies in seven consecutive seasons ranks amongst some iconic managers.", "source": {"uri": "transfermarkt.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "transfermarkt.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Martial", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Martial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatasaray_S.K._(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galatasaray S.K.

The Dutchman, who won back-to-back trophies, is committed to achieving new levels of success with the club amidst a massive operational overhaul led by new co-owner Jim Ratcliffe.\n\nManchester United manager Erik ten Hag has signed a contract extension through to 2026, the Premier League club announced Thursday. Despite a tumultuous season culminating in the club's worst league finish in 34 years, the Dutchman has secured his position.\n\nAfter a thorough performance review, United chose to retain Ten Hag, offering a one-year extension on his existing contract, which was set to expire at the end of the upcoming season. Under his tenure, the team won back-to-back trophies, including the English League Cup and FA Cup.\n\nNew co-owner Jim Ratcliffe, who acquired a 27.7% stake in the club earlier this year, has spearheaded a massive overhaul, including appointing a new CEO, sporting director, and technical director.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nAn agent who has dealt with Manchester United messaged earlier this week: \"Everything must change for everything to remain the same.\"\n\nErik ten Hag's situation remains unchanged. He is on the same contract he signed to take over as United manager in April 2022.\n\nInitially, United were unable to confirm whether they had triggered the one-year extension in Ten Hag's contract or just extended his contract. Eventually, a source clarified the one-year option had been exercised.\n\nThat is a crucial difference. Whatever Ten Hag's requests or demands under the new co-owner, they are not contractual.\n\nWhen Ten Hag spoke to Dutch broadcaster NOS last month, he said: \"We had a good talk and various topics were discussed and the conclusion was that we will continue with each other but also the conclusion is that we are going to sit down to renew the contract.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Ten Hag's contract extended by United\n\nEXCLUSIVE: United set to sign Slovakia winger\n\nThe interviewer replied: \"Okay, so the air is cleared and you go because you have another year's contract and you're going to renew now?\"\n\n\"Well of course, we absolutely have to come to some sort of agreement,\" Ten Hag replied. An agreement was technically unnecessary.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos cohorts were caught between a rock and a hard place. Offer Ten Hag a longer contract and they appear weak, having intended to sack him until the FA Cup final. Take up the one-year option and it is hardly a ringing endorsement.\n\nBut it is also sensible. Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer were sacked in the same year they signed completely new contracts. United have moved on from Ed Woodward's gullible ways.\n\nIt still feels like an uneasy alliance and effectively extends Ten Hag's trial period. United will have their three \"pillars\" - Dan Ashworth, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox - in place to judge him next season.\n\nAshworth said: \"With two trophies in the past two seasons, Erik has reinforced his record as one of the most consistently successful coaches in European football.\n\n\"While the club's review of last season highlighted areas for improvement, it also reached a clear conclusion that Erik was the best partner for us to work with in driving up standards and outcomes.\n\n\"This group of players and staff have already shown they are capable of competing and winning at the top level; now we need to do it more consistently. With our strengthened football leadership team now in place, we are looking forward to working hand-in-hand with Erik to achieve our shared ambitions for this football club.\"\n\nThat struck a diplomatic but defiant tone. United have a nucleus to build a new squad around, Ten Hag's standout victories have come against the elite (Liverpool in August 2022, Barcelona in February 2023 and City in May 2024), the academy secured a triple-crown last term and Ten Hag is a great champion of United's youth identity.\n\nUnited have implemented their new structure quickly and the aforementioned trio are duty bound to support the manager who has chiselled two years onto an honours board that was unchanged for nearly six years. United now have to be proactive with signings and sales.\n\nTen Hag will soon be supported by compatriots on the coaching staff in Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake. Ten Hag is a stickler for the familiar and/or the Dutch, though the seniority of the support raises questions.\n\nThe seasons become more pivotal at United and Ten Hag has 11 months to earn improved terms. Take United back into the Champions League, get his hands on more silverware and his hand will be strengthened.\n\nThen things may change.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_luckhurst@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Samuel Luckhurst", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nederlandse_Omroep_Stichting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nederlandse Omroep Stichting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Woodward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ed Woodward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Wilcox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Wilcox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_Gunnar_Solskj\u00e6r", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruud_van_Nistelrooy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruud van Nistelrooy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29087873.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-30-at-154714.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706156", "eventUri": "eng-9706156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nErik ten Hag has signed a new Manchester United contract until 2026. The Dutchman has committed his future to the Red Devils after guiding them to the FA Cup at the end of last season.\n\nIt's a show of faith from the United board - including Sir Jim Ratcliffe and new technical director Dan Ashworth - to Ten Hag as they plan for a fresh start at Old Trafford. United are looking to improve on finishing eighth in the Premier League last season, which represented their lowest-ever finish.\n\nBut the club are confident that Ten Hag is the right man for the job, despite a lengthy end-of-season review which saw the likes of Thomas Tuchel and Marco Silva approached about replacing him. However, Ten Hag is the man to take them forward into next season and he now has no excuses.\n\nOften during their difficult spells last season, many blamed the Glazers and those running the club high up for their damning performances and results, rather than Ten Hag. The ex-Ajax boss was blamed at times for his style of football and defensive shape, but he didn't get the brunt of the criticism.\n\nREAD MORE: Man United 'extremely confident' of key signing with \u00a385m star's transfer a 'strong possibility'\n\nREAD MORE: De Ligt gives blunt response to transfer question amid Man United links\n\nWith United now looking more structured at the top and a technical director appointed, Ten Hag can focus on coaching the team to play a better brand of football and delivering more successful results on the pitch. Reports emerged that Ten Hag had a significant part to play in recruitment, which some claimed deviated his focus from coaching but he does not need to do switch his attention anymore.\n\nIn his first press conference after being appointed as United boss in May 2022, Ten Hag promised that he had a plan in place and was confident of delivering that over the course of his time in Manchester. He admitted the plan was \"huge\" and said that \"you will see\" it in action once he told it to his staff and players.\n\nHe said at the time: \"The confidence is that I have a good feeling with the people around. I have a good feeling from the meetings. We have a plan and now it's about getting the plan done, to get it into process. To co-operate, to be consistent in our plan, and when we have good people around with the right connection and the right commitment, we will achieve the success we want to.\"\n\n\"Our plan is huge and we only have a short time [to be able to explain it now],\" he added. \"Of course, we will first roll it out to the staff and then we will roll it out to the players and you will see.\"\n\nAlthough United finished third and won the Carabao Cup in his debut season, it still did not feel like there was a distinct plan and direction to where his team was going. United would often rely on individual brilliance and their top-class players to save them and come to the rescue.\n\nIn the second season, United struggled and that is where Ten Hag's flaws became evident. United did not have a distinct style and it felt as though they were 'outcoached' by even some of the teams the Red Devils would have been expected to beat, even if that is just the supporters who think that.\n\nFor example, Fulham went to Old Trafford in February and battered them. Even though it took until the 97th minute for the Whites to score a winner, they could have scored so many more before that. Silva had Fulham drilled into a successful style, while it didn't look like United had any idea of what their identity was. Ten Hag must solve that going into the new season and there can be no blame on anything else this time.\n\nBut change is afoot and Ineos appear set on finally delivering the 'good people' around Ten Hag that the manager has been so desperate for. Omar Berrada is set to become the club's new chief executive, with Dan Ashworth, Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell arriving too.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake are also due to join his coaching staff to offer further support behind the scenes. It all means that this season, Ten Hag can finally fulfil his promised of delivering a plan.\n\nHe must be backed in the summer to be able to achieve that, too. A new centre-back, left-back, central midfielder, right winger and striker need to be signed, with players set to follow out of the exit door. There is no doubt Ten Hag can be successful if he is supported, and with Ratcliffe and Ashworth now on board, successful times could be heading back to Old Trafford.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

It could be argued that an unexpected win at Wembley saved his job.\n\nVos from SEG Sports Management, who represent Ten Hag, has reacted to the news that he has signed a contract extension to remain at Old Trafford until 2026.\n\nSpeaking to football reporter Jacque Talbot, Vos said: \"It's been quite a rollercoaster ride since Erik ten Hag joined Manchester United more than two years ago, but I'm proud to have been part of it.\n\n\"Today, we can announce that we will continue to be part of it: Erik ten Hag will stay in the red part of town for two more years. It was and is a pleasure working with all the people involved, from past to present. \"SEG is proud to have assisted both Erik and the new Manchester United football leadership team in making this extension possible. I am very much looking forward to visiting Old Trafford again.\"\n\nIt has been well documented that SEG's relationship with United had become strained in the past year. We think it's something that is worth keeping an eye on too.\n\nSources close to Stretty News have raised multiple suspicions about SEG's activity.\n\nIt's a common belief among fans that SEG have had too much of an influence at the club since Ten Hag was appointed manager in 2022. While I believe the manager should have a say in incoming and outgoings in the transfer market, we now have some of the most respect figures in football running the club. The best outcome is if all parties can work together to make United successful again.\n\nSubscribe to the Stretty News podcast Strettycast for weekly episodes on Manchester United.

If I don't have the right impression, I won't start on it. The last thing I want is to look over my shoulder to make sure they don't shoot me in the back.\"\n\nThat was Erik ten Hag speaking two and half years ago, contemplating what it would take for him to be tempted away from his job at Ajax, only a few months before he was appointed as the new manager of Manchester United.\n\n\"If there is a good working climate, fertile soil for development, people I can trust and with whom I have a good feeling, I would consider it,\" he said.\n\nTrust is important to Ten Hag. And after United's end-of-season review advanced as far as discussing salaries with two potential successors, only to then conclude there would not be a change of manager after all, that trust has had to be reaffirmed.\n\nIs a one-year extension of his existing terms until 2026 enough? Arguably, an entirely new contract would have been a greater show of faith. But even Ten Hag must admit that at one point he appeared unlikely to be in the job at the start of the coming season, never mind have his stay extended until the end of the next.\n\nIt is not as if any contract extension is a real guarantee of long-term job security at Old Trafford, anyway. Jose Mourinho was dismissed within a year of extending his terms in early 2018. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's three-year renewal would have expired last week had he seen it out. He only lasted another four months.\n\nThe wisdom of tying Ten Hag down to an extended deal after presiding over United's lowest finish of the Premier League era, especially only weeks after giving serious thought to replacing him, will be seriously scrutinised if results and performances do not improve. It would not only call INEOS' sporting judgment into question, but their financial acumen too.\n\nUnited paid out \u00a324.6m in exceptional costs the year of Solskjaer's dismissal and Ralf Rangnick's interim spell, after shelling out \u00a319.6m to rid themselves of Mourinho three seasons earlier. With INEOS counting every penny in not only the transfer market but their wider restructuring of the club, being forced into a substantial, unplanned payout would be far from ideal.\n\nNeither Ten Hag nor United can therefore afford next season to be more of the same. And so some things are still likely to change, even if the name on the door of the manager's office hasn't.\n\nThere remains the prospect of Mitchell van der Gaag departing. Were he to leave, United would lose a diligent, hard-working presence around Carrington who was no stranger to early starts and late finishes, an assistant who was often in the building before his manager's 8am starts.\n\nThe 52-year-old is also a polyglot and easily able to communicate across the language barriers within the dressing room but his style of communication has at times led executives to question whether the mood around Carrington could be lifted. Van der Gaag may potentially want to pursue career as a No 1. Benni McCarthy is also leaving after the expiry of his two-year contract and is thought to want to be a manager again.\n\nBut in a sign that they do still trust their manager's judgment, although INEOS initiated this reshuffling of the coaching staff, the likely new additions were selected on Ten Hag's recommendation.\n\nThe arrivals of Ruud van Nistelrooy, the former United great, and Rene Hake, the manager of Go Ahead Eagles remain subject to final agreements and securing work permits.\n\nIt is not the first time that Ten Hag has headhunted Hake, having previously persuaded him to join FC Twente's academy after forming a bond while coming up against him at Emmen. In 2012, Ten Hag narrowly beat Hake to the Go Ahead job, his first in management. Yet Hake led Go Ahead to their highest league finish in 45 years last season, while also winning the European play-offs.\n\nVan Nistelrooy, who sits eleventh among United's all-time leading scorers, has been slowly but surely earning his coaching stripes since the end of his playing career more than a decade ago.\n\nHis first and only season as a head coach role ended with him winning the KNVB Cup, finishing as Eredivisie runners-up and him leaving PSV Eindhoven under something of a cloud, with reports of tensions between Van Nistelrooy and his assistants Fred Rutten and Andre Ooijer.\n\nPSV's statement Van Nistelrooy's departure expressed \"regret\" at the time, yet explained that in their head coach's opinion, \"there was too little support within the club to continue longer\".\n\nRutten, incidentally, was one of the first head coaches Ten Hag worked under at the start of his own managerial career and turned down an approach to join United's staff two years ago. If there were any differences between Van Nistelrooy and Ten Hag's former mentor, they do not appear to have put the United manager off the appointment.\n\nThat Ten Hag has still been able to select his assistants rather than have new hires forced upon him is a sign that INEOS are still willing to place their trust in him. He will still be the manager in name too, as opposed to taking on a 'head coach' moniker.\n\nOne of the other key points of contention entering these contract talks regarded Ten Hag's influence over transfer policy, particularly the veto written into his contract. That remains, as does the recruitment department's.\n\nStill, there should now be greater balance in transfer policy. While Ten Hag has held a greater sway over transfers than intended since his appointment, it has largely been out of necessity, filling gaps that would not typically be left by a well-functioning football structure.\n\nIf his influence is at all diminished from here onwards, that should only be because there are now others above him who have both the courage and authority to say no to a manager and are able to present him with viable alternatives to his suggested targets. In the past, that was not always the case.\n\nThere are a lot of issues to address this summer, some ideally before players return to the training at Carrington on Monday, with Mason Greenwood's future and the Jadon Sancho question unresolved for now. Not to the mention the small matter of no significant ins or outs in the transfer market yet.\n\nAt least with Ten Hag's future settled, and Dan Ashworth now installed as sporting director, the structure is finally in place. Giving Ten Hag the opportunity to prove himself within that rebuilt and reformed structure was a key part of INEOS' reasoning for eventually deciding to stick and not twist.\n\nAfter compromises on both sides, this extension provides a platform for the club and their manager to trust each other and build together. But results, above all else, will ultimately dictate how long this new sense of mutual trust lasts, and whether or not Ten Hag feels the need to look over his shoulder.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_critchley@nytimes.com", "name": "Mark Critchley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruud_van_Nistelrooy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ruud van Nistelrooy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Mourinho", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_van_der_Gaag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell van der Gaag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Ahead_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Go Ahead Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rutten", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Rutten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Emmen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Emmen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benni_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benni McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Twente", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Twente"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralf_Rangnick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ralf Rangnick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9_Ooijer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9 Ooijer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNVB_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KNVB Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship_play-offs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship play-offs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/03150107/GettyImages-2153995752-scaled-e1720033314512.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706156", "eventUri": "eng-9706156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

He burst onto the scene as a teenager at Ajax, back when Ten Hag was in charge in Amsterdam, as he took Europe by storm.\n\nHis career has since stalled following moves to Juventus and then Bayern. Now Manchester could be the next place he attempts to deliver on his huge potential. De Ligt will play a part, but Ten Hag will also need to aid the defender and arrest a poor record when it comes to signing former players.\n\nThe United boss has gone after several individuals whom he's worked with previously - and very few have been success. Ten Hag has spent close to \u00a3200million on acquiring those who he knows best whilst in Manchester, but so far that money has not been well spent amid continued criticism of his transfer record.\n\nAntony was the marquee signing of his first summer back in 2022. The Brazilian had impressed for Ajax the season prior but United were not keen to pay his mammoth valuation - although Ten Hag was. Eventually the winger moved for more than \u00a380m and remains the club's second most expensive buy.\n\nHe scored against Arsenal on his debut but after that things have gone down hill and last season especially he was widely criticised for his performances and his antics.\n\nLisandro Martinez also followed him that summer, joining for more than \u00a348m. Initially there were fears over his lack of height given he was a centre-half. He had a slow start but became a linchpin of the backline and is regarded by many as the best defender at the club. Consistent injuries though have plagued his time in Manchester.\n\nAndre Onana was a major arrival last summer as Ten Hag and the club opted to move on from David de Gea after more than a decade. The Inter Milan keeper was also part of Ten Hag's Ajax side that made the Champions League semi-finals in 2019.\n\nHis point of difference was an ability to play out from the back, but his shot stopping was a huge issue. On his debut he was lucky not to give away a penalty before he made numerous blunders which led to goals, but the Cameroonian did improve as the year went on.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The cost-cutting move aims to save tens of millions, redirecting funds to bolster the first-team squad. Erik ten Hag signed a new deal to stay at Old Trafford until 2026.\n\nManchester United staff have been left 'stunned and shocked' by the club's decision to make almost a quarter of its workforce redundant, journalist David Ornstein has claimed.\n\nThe situation was reportedly 'deeply unpleasant' for United staff after the club undertook a wide-scale cost review, which recommended cuts across all departments.\n\nAccording to MailOnline, in a series of meetings earlier this week, Man United staff were given the unpleasant news that up to 250 employees would be losing their jobs.\n\nUnited commissioned a cost review after Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS purchased a minority stake in the club in January.\n\nThe Red Devils underwent multiple changes in their recruitment team, with sporting director Dan Ashworth joining recently after ending his four-month gardening leave.\n\nMailOnline suggests United's move to make staff redundant was driven by two main factors. Firstly, INEOS' arrival has shifted the priority to enhancing the performance of the first team at Old Trafford.\n\nSecondly, the anticipated savings from these cost-cutting measures are expected to run into the tens of millions, with the funds redirected to bolster Erik ten Hag's squad.\n\nUnited Sackings Branded 'Brutal' 'There was silence in the room'\n\nOrnstein, on the Sky Sports Back Pages podcast, described the atmosphere at Man United, branding the situation 'deeply unpleasant' for staff members:\n\n\"A pretty brutal one.

Plus latest transfer news", "body": "We look at whether Erik ten Hag can turn things around at Man Utd this season and discuss some of the latest transfer rumours.\n\nManchester United's 2023-24 season was one for the movies - a beautiful tragicomedy where the lead character goes through tribulations and defeats and somehow finds a way to survive in the end.\n\nOn their opening match of the recently concluded season, United were completely outplayed in the controversial 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. United fans must have been optimistic about a much-improved performance and result in what was expected to be an even better season. Little did they know that their performance in the League opener was going to be a constant theme as the season progressed.\n\nThere were matches where United were poor and completely dominated, but somehow managed to win (like the second-leg matches against Brentford and Luton Town); and there were some where they deservedly won (like the first-leg against Chelsea); and there were others where they were outplayed and beaten (like in the two legs against Manchester City).\n\nTheir Champions League campaign was nothing to write home about, finishing bottom of a group that had Cophenaghen, Galatasaray and Bayern Munich. Their 57-goal tally was the joint-lowest of any team in the top eight and they finished the season in eighth position, their worst-ever League finish of the Premier League era.\n\nWhile many may be quick to point at the team's poor performances, some undeniable factors played a role in the team's poor league outing and on top of the list are injuries.\n\nLike every moving mechanical part and every leading organisation, you need the availability of key personnel to make it function properly. Unfortunately, Erik Ten Hag suffered a barrage of injuries to some of his key personnel, especially in defence which led to their erratic defensive record.\n\nAt the end end of the recently concluded season, United had only three players with over 28 starts in the Premier League.\n\nUnited's best performance came when Lisandro Martinez, Luke Shaw, Bruno Fernandes and Rasmus H\u00f8jlund all started a Premier League match. This came in the three matches between January 28 and February 4 where United scored 11 goals in those matches. And then, injuries hit again. Fans who bought tickets from a secondary market couldn't beleive their bad luck.\n\nTen Hag did not have that much luxury - and there was not much depth in his squad to maintain that consistency. The highlight of this was when Casemiro had a game to forget against Crystal Palace when he was used as a centre-back.\n\nIf there was any indication about United's potential to win a game under Ten Hag, it was the fitness of their key players in the same starting lineup for a longer spell of matches.\n\nAchieving two domestic titles under an unstable structure of the club - only to be ditched when the club is beginning to get their house in order by hiring the best hands to form the sporting department of the club - just doesn't seem right. Ten Hag more than deserves another chance at redemption and his FA Cup triumph over Premier League winners, Manchester City just about proved that.\n\nHis trust in youth and his perfect blend of experience is an acumen rarely found in top managers. With United beginning to keep an eye on young players, Ten Hag is the perfect man in place for the development of these players.\n\nHowever, to achieve this, United must not repeat the mistakes of last season by ignoring the addition of quality personnel in key positions like defence. The left-back position sometimes saw Diego Dalot, Sofyan Amrabat, and Aaron Wan-Bissaka utilised in that position.\n\nAs the summer transfer window emerges, United needs to prioritise their defence to challenge for titles next season while also looking for quality players in midfield and attack.\n\nHere's a roundup of some of the players that have been linked to United in recent days.\n\nTen Hag eyes Matthijs de Ligt reunion\n\nAbout five years ago, while Ten Hag was still the coach of Ajax, he had a backline marshalled by Matthijs De Ligt with Andr\u00e9 Onana slotting between the posts. Later on, Lisandro Martinez joined and the team went on to win numerous trophies.\n\nNothing gives a manager more edge than having the players he is well acquainted with at his disposal. United fans can be ecstatic about exciting times at Old Trafford next season if the club can agree a deal for De Ligt.\n\nAccording to a report from German journalist Florian Plettenberg, De Ligt is keen on reuniting with his former manager at United. The Premier League giants are already in contact with Bayern Munich who want at least \u00a342m plus bonuses to let the Dutchman leave the club.\n\nMan Utd eye Bologna star Dan Ndoye\n\nOne of the standout performers at the ongoing European Championship is being courted by some of the European top clubs.\n\nAccording to Swiss outlet, 4-4-2.ch, United have emerged as the frontrunner in the chase for Bologna forward, Ndoye who is currently lighting up Euro 2024 with commendable performances for Switzerland.\n\nThe report adds that the Red Devils have indicated strong interest in the Swiss star and have presented a proposal to Bologna to acquire the forward.\n\nZirkzee ready to accept United move\n\nMan Utd have been on the trails of Bologna star, Joshua Zirkzee for the past couple of months. The player is well-liked across Europe with a host of clubs keeping tabs on him.\n\nHowever, it appears United have stolen a match on their rivals in acquiring the 23-year-old.\n\nAccording to a report from Corriere di Bologna as relayed by ManUtdNews, Zirkzee is 'ready to accept' a move to United as Bologna are already preparing for his departure.\n\nThe Italian side have already set their sights on possible replacements including, Fotis Ioannidis, Thijs Dallinga, Jonathan Burkardt and Georges Mikautadze in case Zirkzee departs the club, as per the report.\n\nZirkzee's contract at the Stadio Renato Dall'Ara will run until 2026 and the report adds United are willing to pay his \u00a334m release clause.\n\nMan Utd plot second swoop for Sergio Reguil\u00f3n\n\nReguil\u00f3n had a brief spell at United last season where he joined on loan from Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nHis impressive stint was overshadowed by the club's overall erratic performances at that time. He was just one of the fewest shining lights in the team, who would always play their hearts out irrespective of the results.\n\nMORE NEWS....\n\nMan Utd 'extremely confident' of signing Joshua Zirkzee\n\nLiverpool reactivate interest in signing Nico Williams from Athletic Bilbao\n\nTottenham showing 'genuine interest' in signing Desire Doue\n\nMan Utd eye surprise swoop to sign Sergio Reguillon\n\nNow, a report from Spanish outlet, AS has revealed United have expressed interest in bringing the six-cap Spain International back to Old Trafford this summer.\n\nThe 27-year-old has made quite the surgeon since joining Tottenham Hotspur. He has been on loan to Atletico Madrid, United and Brentford in just over a year.\n\nAccording to AS, the Red Devils have earmarked the Spaniard as one of the candidates to bolster their left-back position.\n\nHowever, the 13-time Premier League champions face stiff competition from League rivals, West Ham United. Sevilla and Juventus are also reported to have indicated an interest in the former Real Madrid academy star.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nHome \" Features \" Man Utd updates: Can ETH turn the tides next season?

His side ended up eighth in the table, a whopping 31 points behind champions Manchester City, and lost 19 games in all competitions.\n\nLast month's FA Cup final triumph, and the performance that went with it, provided a much-needed mood lift after nine months of doom and gloom, but it wasn't nearly enough to sweep their torrid season under the rug. As such, the next few months could be make or break for the Dutchman.\n\nWith that in mind, here are five things Ten Hag needs to sort out as soon as possible after extending his stay at Old Trafford to ensure next season is plane sailing.\n\nGet Ratcliffe on side\n\nFirst and foremost, Ten Hag needs to address the elephant in the room: Sir Jim Ratcliffe doesn't really want him. Almost as soon as the billionaire's minority stake in the club was confirmed at the start of the year, rumours started swirling that he was lining up replacements for the Dutchman.\n\nThe club then spent a couple of weeks after the season's end speaking to other managers, including former Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, before ultimately deciding to stick rather than twist. Such overt flirtation with other coaches suggests the axe could fall on Ten Hag's neck as soon as United hit another rough patch, so the former Ajax boss must find a way to convince Ratcliffe he's worth sticking with, and fast.\n\nIdentify incomings/outgoings\n\nThere are plenty of holes to patch in United's squad, particularly at the back and in midfield. The club have been pushing for a new centre-back, with the likes of Matthijs de Ligt, Jarrad Branthwaite and Marc Guehi on their radar, and are strongly linked with a move for PSG midfielder Manuel Ugarte.\n\nNabbing two or three high-quality players this summer could be the difference between a strong start to the season and a tepid one, so getting his ducks in order here should be a top priority for Ten Hag.\n\nSimilarly, getting the futures of the likes of Jadon Sancho, Casemiro and Harry Maguire sorted needs to be done ASAP, with all three rumoured to be on the chopping block. Sancho's issues with Ten Hag are well documented, and failure to either get rid of or patch things up with the Englishman could cause serious problems. Meanwhile, Casemiro and Maguire, both of whom are on huge wages, will need to be moved on if United sign new players in their positions\n\nBoost morale\n\nFA Cup win notwithstanding, the mood around Old Trafford is positively grim at the moment. Confidence has arguably never been lower, not only amongst the players but also amongst the supporters, and Ten Hag needs to address this problem sharpish.\n\nIt'll take a lot of work to banish the ghosts of last season, but a strong, positive pre-season, coupled with a few smart signings and sensible departures could inject a little life and belief back into the squad. If he can get the players firing on all cylinders, the fans, and more importantly, Ratcliffe, will be back on his side in no time.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The 26-year-old scored just eight goals in all competitions, with just two of them coming before Christmas.\n\nThe fact that he bagged 30 goals the season before goes to show how vital it'll be to get the best out of him, and how much United's season could hinge on which version of Rashford turns up at the start of the campaign next month. If Ten Hag can find a way to turn Rashford from a purple patch player into a ruthlessly consistent difference-maker then he'll be on easy street - and it'll take a little pressure off Rasmus Hojlund's shoulders too!\n\nSolve the injury crisis\n\nUnited suffered 60 different injuries last season, and losing key players like Varane, Hojlund, Lisandro Martinez, Mason Mount, Christian Eriksen, Luke Shaw and Casemiro for long periods hamstrung them and stopped them from ever getting into any sort of rhythm.\n\nPreventing the same thing from happening next season is an absolute must, and whether that means tweaking training methods, leaning more on the medical team, or being a tad more patient with recovery times - as, reportedly, wasn't the case last season - then Ten Hag really ought to do it.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nJoshua Zirkzee could become the latest player Erik ten Hag convinces to join Manchester United after they reportedly spoke last month.\n\nTen Hag has a handy habit of calling transfer targets during his two years at Old Trafford, with at least four players speaking with the manager before signing. Christian Eriksen and Tyrell Malacia acknowledged that in interviews after arriving.\n\nIt was the other way around with Lisandro Martinez, as Ten Hag revealed his former player called him after deciding to leave Ajax. Then, last summer, the Manchester Evening News reported the manager held multiple video calls with Rasmus Hojlund.\n\nREAD MORE: Marcus Rashford transfer would deliver United massive FFP pure profit boost\n\nREAD MORE:Ten Hag in talks to block Manuel Ugarte from taking dream United shirt number\n\nTen Hag acknowledged before last year's transfer window opened that he had been speaking with potential targets. That is reportedly the case again despite a raft of changes at United this year.\n\nSky Italia reported that the manager spoke to Zirkzee during the final week of June. More recently, Sky Sport claimed that Ten Hag held a personal meeting with the player's management at Sport Invest and acknowledged that the manager and player have had direct chats.\n\nBoth are Dutch, with the forward coming through the academies at ADO Den Haag and Feyenoord while Ten Hag was the Utrecht head coach. From there, Zirkzee joined Bayern Munich in the summer of 2017, where, two years earlier, Ten Hag was the coach of their reserve team. While their time in Germany did not overlap, it is fair to assume that the manager kept tabs on his former employers after returning to the Netherlands.\n\nUnited not needing to negotiate a transfer fee with Bologna due to the \u00a334million release clause in Zirkzee's contract with the club means it makes sense for Ten Hag to take this direct approach with his countryman as personal terms are with the player's representative are the pivotal aspect in need of agreeing.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

Jurgen Klopp fielded three throughout.\n\nIt got to the stage that Antony was effectively playing at full-back. Harry Maguire had been left alone with Diogo Dalot on one side and a lot of space on the other.\n\nIn hindsight this defence, even in the brief period it was deployed for out of sheer desperation, possibly wasn't even the worst that Erik ten Hag put out onto the pitch. Was the group of players who conceded three on that day really more incompetent and rag-tag than the selection including Aaron Wan-Bissaka at left-back and Casemiro centrally during the 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace six weeks later?\n\nREAD MORE: Man United transfer news LIVE\n\nREAD MORE: Dan Ashworth hint about how Manchester United recruitment will change\n\nTen Hag was rightly criticised for the lack of structure around and in front of the defence, especially after Andre Onana was often left facing 20 or more shots at his goal on a weekly basis, but the coach did have a point. His options had been decimated by injury throughout, and having serious success with an XI including multiple players out of position or not in the plans 12 months ago doesn't help.\n\nThe extent to which Ten Hag was responsible for these issues is now a moot point. The United hierarchy, headed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, his Ineos minority ownership investment group, and the fresh model in place, reached a decision one way or another, to keep the head coach in charge.\n\nNow the plan is to give him better tools to work with. The exit of Raphael Varane on June 30 marked the beginning of the transition but is almost certain not to be the end. United have already set their stall out in the summer transfer market to make defensive changes.\n\nFrom an opening day bid for Jarrad Branthwaite to talks with Nice's Jean-Claire Todibo, the focus is clear. Luckily for Ten Hag, despite the minimal budget available so far, and a lack of genuine incoming activity, there is still time to overhaul his options.\n\nStarting in goal, for several reasons. 1) The 'keeper is obviously part of the defensive unit, 2) at United last season Onana was often left completely stranded, and 3) Ten Hag has such a big role for his No.1 on the ball that he can be considered another defender at times anyway.\n\nOnana, somehow, was one of the better-performing players for United last season despite a pretty woeful start. He, and Ten Hag, and everyone else associated with the club, for that matter, will hope things improve ahead and around him.\n\nDiogo Dalot\n\nNo change just yet from the side that Ten Hag was selecting last season, but it's about to shift. Dalot was one of the best outfield performers, to go alongside his goalkeeper, and will be aiming to build on an impressive individual campaign even if the team failed to meet expectations.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt\n\nHere is where things start to get interesting. The first new signing in this defence is Bayern Munich centre-back De Ligt. He has the links to Ten Hag from their Ajax days but even without that overlap he would be a standout candidate.\n\nDe Ligt has top-level European experience, leadership traits, and has played with what could be up to three members of a back four and goalkeeper previously. He is the most obvious current replacement for Varane on the right side of defence even though it is left-footed options being pursued. His arrival could end Harry Maguire's United career once and for all, though.\n\nLisandro Martinez\n\nThe Argentine may well feel like a new signing if he can stay fit next season. Having missed most of the 2023/24 campaign, Martinez will be welcomed back with open arms by coaching staff and teammates alike.\n\nWhen on form, Martinez demonstrated just why Ten Hag was so keen to get him in during the first of his two full summers so far. As the little man to De Ligt, the big and small partnership here, playing on their preferred sides, would be an ideal base to build from. Martinez is United's best defender when he's available, this spot is his permanently should the niggles and problems steer clear.\n\nMiguel Gutierrez\n\nWith Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia as first choice plus the option to play Dalot on the left if and when needed, United didn't look like they would be needed a new full-back anytime soon. But with injuries ruling both players out for far too much of the past 12 months, it's no surprise that they have been drawn back into the market.\n\nReportedly it is Girona's Gutierrez who has caught the attention. The Spaniard, who came through the Real Madrid youth academy before moving to City Football Group side Girona in 2022, could move back to the capital this summer before being sold.\n\nIt's said that Madrid will trigger a clause in his contract to snap him up after impressing under Michel. Florentino Perez will then aim to sell him on for over \u00a325million, and United are one of the sides linked.\n\nGutierrez, 22, played 35 times in the league for Girona last year as they finished in the Champions League places, scoring twice and assisting seven. He has become a mainstay in the side and is now earning attention.\n\nOn paper this is how United could look if their transfer plans come through.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThere was a point during the 4-3 FA Cup quarter-final win over Liverpool in March that Manchester United had just one centre-back on the pitch. Jurgen Klopp fielded three throughout.\n\nIt got to the stage that Antony was effectively playing at full-back. Harry Maguire had been left alone with Diogo Dalot on one side and a lot of space on the other.\n\nIn hindsight this defence, even in the brief period it was deployed for out of sheer desperation, possibly wasn't even the worst that Erik ten Hag put out onto the pitch. Was the group of players who conceded three on that day really more incompetent and rag-tag than the selection including Aaron Wan-Bissaka at left-back and Casemiro centrally during the 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace six weeks later?\n\nREAD MORE: Man United transfer news LIVE\n\nREAD MORE: Dan Ashworth hint about how Manchester United recruitment will change\n\nTen Hag was rightly criticised for the lack of structure around and in front of the defence, especially after Andre Onana was often left facing 20 or more shots at his goal on a weekly basis, but the coach did have a point. His options had been decimated by injury throughout, and having serious success with an XI including multiple players out of position or not in the plans 12 months ago doesn't help.\n\nThe extent to which Ten Hag was responsible for these issues is now a moot point. The United hierarchy, headed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, his Ineos minority ownership investment group, and the fresh model in place, reached a decision one way or another, to keep the head coach in charge.\n\nNow the plan is to give him better tools to work with. The exit of Raphael Varane on June 30 marked the beginning of the transition but is almost certain not to be the end. United have already set their stall out in the summer transfer market to make defensive changes.\n\nFrom an opening day bid for Jarrad Branthwaite to talks with Nice's Jean-Claire Todibo, the focus is clear. Luckily for Ten Hag, despite the minimal budget available so far, and a lack of genuine incoming activity, there is still time to overhaul his options.\n\nHere, the Manchester Evening News takes a look at what his dream backline could be.\n\nAndre Onana\n\nStarting in goal, for several reasons. 1) The 'keeper is obviously part of the defensive unit, 2) at United last season Onana was often left completely stranded, and 3) Ten Hag has such a big role for his No.1 on the ball that he can be considered another defender at times anyway.\n\nOnana, somehow, was one of the better-performing players for United last season despite a pretty woeful start. He, and Ten Hag, and everyone else associated with the club, for that matter, will hope things improve ahead and around him.\n\nDiogo Dalot\n\nNo change just yet from the side that Ten Hag was selecting last season, but it's about to shift. Dalot was one of the best outfield performers, to go alongside his goalkeeper, and will be aiming to build on an impressive individual campaign even if the team failed to meet expectations.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt\n\nHere is where things start to get interesting. The first new signing in this defence is Bayern Munich centre-back De Ligt. He has the links to Ten Hag from their Ajax days but even without that overlap he would be a standout candidate.\n\nDe Ligt has top-level European experience, leadership traits, and has played with what could be up to three members of a back four and goalkeeper previously. He is the most obvious current replacement for Varane on the right side of defence even though it is left-footed options being pursued. His arrival could end Harry Maguire's United career once and for all, though.\n\nLisandro Martinez\n\nThe Argentine may well feel like a new signing if he can stay fit next season. Having missed most of the 2023/24 campaign, Martinez will be welcomed back with open arms by coaching staff and teammates alike.\n\nWhen on form, Martinez demonstrated just why Ten Hag was so keen to get him in during the first of his two full summers so far. As the little man to De Ligt, the big and small partnership here, playing on their preferred sides, would be an ideal base to build from. Martinez is United's best defender when he's available, this spot is his permanently should the niggles and problems steer clear.\n\nMiguel Gutierrez\n\nWith Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia as first choice plus the option to play Dalot on the left if and when needed, United didn't look like they would be needed a new full-back anytime soon. But with injuries ruling both players out for far too much of the past 12 months, it's no surprise that they have been drawn back into the market.\n\nReportedly it is Girona's Gutierrez who has caught the attention. The Spaniard, who came through the Real Madrid youth academy before moving to City Football Group side Girona in 2022, could move back to the capital this summer before being sold.\n\nIt's said that Madrid will trigger a clause in his contract to snap him up after impressing under Michel. Florentino Perez will then aim to sell him on for over \u00a325million, and United are one of the sides linked.\n\nGutierrez, 22, played 35 times in the league for Girona last year as they finished in the Champions League places, scoring twice and assisting seven. He has become a mainstay in the side and is now earning attention.\n\nOn paper this is how United could look if their transfer plans come through. Other defensive targets have included Branthwaite, Todibo, Leny Yoro, Todibo, and more. There is still room for rotation here as well with Jonny Evans in the mix, a decision to be made over Maguire, Willy Kambwala aiming for a breakout season, and full-back depth existing.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

He's just the latest addition to Sir Jim Ratcliffe's backroom staff, with CEO Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox appointed earlier in the year.\n\nAshworth, who spent time with Brighton and within the FA setup earlier in his career, has reportedly drawn up a four-man transfer shortlist for his new employers. There are also expected to be further exits, with the likes of Raphael Varane and Anthony Martial having already moved on, as Erik ten Hag's squad is given a refresh.\n\nTen Hag is sticking around, despite United holding talks with a potential successor over the summer, but will need to improve on last season's eighth-place finish. United have at least qualified for Europe thanks to their FA Cup triumph, albeit in the Europa League rather than the Champions League.\n\nSo, what might United's starting line-up look like this season if Ashworth is able to bring in his targets? Mirror Football has taken a closer look.\n\nGoalkeeper and defence\n\nUnited conceded 15 more league goals last season than in Ten Hag's first campaign, and this might suggest a desperate need to strengthen. However, as pointed out more than once by the manager, key injuries played their part.\n\nLuke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez missed chunks of the season, and both can be expected to start if fit. Diogo Dalot and Andre Onana were bright sparks in an often tough season, with both expected to keep their spots, but there is one big gap remaining.\n\nWhat would represent a good summer for Man Utd? Have your say in the comments section\n\nWith Everton playing hardball on Jarrad Branthwaite, Matthijs de Light could end up being the senior centre-back to come in. The Dutchman was highly valued by Ten Hag at Ajax and appears ready to leave Bayern Munich, and while he might not be the only new arrival in his position he's likely to be an instant starter if he does arrive.\n\nMidfield\n\nA defensive midfielder also seems like a matter of urgency, given how much Casemiro dropped off last term. Manuel Ugarte appears to be Ashworth's preference, with the Uruguayan's agent indicating a move away from Paris Saint-Germain this summer is likely.\n\nUgarte could be the strong partner Kobbie Mainoo needs as the teenager looks to kick on from a breakout season. Furthermore, the holes which often appeared in the middle last term helped restrict the impact of Bruno Fernandes, who could be allowed to push forward and attack from further left if he has a solid base behind him\n\nIf United decide the players they have aren't what they need - and questions remain over the future of Christian Eriksen and Hannibal Mejbri, among others - more additions could follow. However, it's important they get the main one right.\n\nForwards\n\nRasmus Hojlund blew hot and cold in his first season as a Manchester United player, but the club clearly sees him as the future. The same goes for Alejandro Garnacho, often the liveliest player in the starting XI last term.\n\nThere will be new additions, though, with Ten Hag admitting Profit and Sustainability Rules ensured a much-needed striker couldn't be added in January. Joshua Zirkzee could be one of those new faces after firing Bologna into the Champions League, allowing for variety in United's front-line.\n\nA straightforward partnership between Zirkzee and Hojlund might be an option, with either capable ot leading the line flanked by two wide men in support. That means Marcus Rashford, Amad and even Antony could still have roles to play as Ten Hag gets a feel for his best shape, and that could well vary depending on the opposition.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Former set-piece coach, Eric Ramsay, left midway through last season to manage Minnesota United in the USA.\n\nUnited's former technical director, Darren Fletcher, stepped up to fill the void left by Ramsay's departure. But with Jason Wilcox having been appointed as United's technical director, Fletcher's future remains unclear, with the former United midfielder effectively without a role.\n\nThere are many other key members of Ten Hag's coaching team, including club doctor Gary O'Driscoll, fitness coach Paolo Guadino, head of performance analysis Paul Brand and strength and conditioning coach Michael Clegg, but those are the major roles and figures to whom the Dutchman delegates.\n\nOne key area Ratcliffe and his newly-assembled team of football executives are looking to improve is United's paucity of goals. Last season in the Premier League, United managed just 57 goals from 38 games, the joint-lowest return in the top half of the table and an unacceptable return for a squad with such an attacking threat and potential.\n\nWith that in mind, Ratcliffe and Co - with the involvement of Ten Hag - have sought to appoint a new forwards coach to replace McCarthy, whose contract is set to expire and who is not expected to return to his role in pre-season.\n\nFormer United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who scored a formidable haul of 150 goals from 2019 games between 2001 and 2006, is set to join Ten Hag's coaching staff, once the manager's own new contract is confirmed, which is expected to be within the coming days.\n\nAnother, less familiar, new face expected to be added to Ten Hag's coaching staff is another Dutchman, Rene Hake, currently the manager of Eredivisie club Go Ahead Eagles.\n\nUnited's move to recruit Hake, 52, raises questions over the future of McClaren and Van der Gaag, although the latter has worked with Ten Hag for years and would only be likely to leave to take on a bigger role elsewhere.\n\nHake went into management at Ten Hag's first club as a player, FC Twente, with the two men having both coached Utrecht and Go Ahead Eagles, who he led into Europe for only the third time in their history last month.\n\nThe thinking at United is that Hake will bring fresh ideas and tactical input to Ten Hag's approach, reinvigorating and energising the coaching team, with Van Nistelrooy helping the forwards rediscover their scoring touch.\n\nAfter scoring a career-best 30 goals the season before last, Marcus Rashford managed just eight last term, while \u00a372million Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund managed to double that total in his debut campaign.\n\nThere is so much more to come from both strikers in terms of their goal output and Hojlund, in particular, could learn a great deal from Van Nistelrooy about the art of being in the right place at the right time, to find the net on a consistent basis.\n\nVan Nistelrooy was unrivalled in terms of his movement in the six-yard box, knowing when to time his runs to perfection to get on the end of crosses and loose balls in predatory fashion, something Hojlund struggled with last season.\n\nHaving turned down the chance to succeed Vincent Kompany at recently-relegated Burnley, former PSV Eindhoven coach Van Nistelrooy is set for an emotional return to United, where his expertise in the art of goalscoring could prove invaluable to his old club.\n\nWith sporting director Dan Ashworth now ready to start work, after a compensation package was agreed with Newcastle, and CEO Omar Berrada starting next week, United have their new executive team in place to begin work on Ratcliffe's stated aim of making the club great once again.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Coppin told Barbados TODAY on Tuesday that $400 000 was allocated for a major redevelopment project at the locations that would host practice matches for the various teams competing in the World Cup. Work got underway in the latter part of December last year, he said, adding that he was pleased with the works done during the refurbishment. \u201cThe venues are all ready, spick and span and ready to go. They are now at the required international standard,\u201d Coppin said. Coppin, who is also the cricket operations and development manager at the Barbados Cricket Association, broke down the improvements made to the three venues; Windward Cricket Ground in Lucas Street, St Philip, Police Sports Club in Weymouth, St Michael and the 3Ws Oval at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus. He revealed that at each ground the dressing room and bathroom facilities were refurbished, the nets at some venues were replaced and additional sight screens were erected. Additionally, the pitches were also regraded, the outfields were levelled, resoiled and irrigated. Coppin said the soil used at the venues was the same as that at Kensington Oval, pointing out that it came from St Philip and underwent various testing. Coppin said that practice games had already commenced, with the 3Ws Oval having hosted a match between Oman and a Barbados Select team last week. \u201cEverything went well,\u201d he said. The LOC events manager also said that a number of ground staff were trained, including those at various clubs and schools across the island. He said a one-week training workshop was held, which walked through many preparation scenarios. About 60 to 70 people across the venues have gained employment to facilitate the practice matches. Coppin said the upgrades will have a lasting impact beyond the World Cup. \u201cThe cricket landscape across the island stands to benefit from these upgrades. Cricketers who would now be playing at these venues will play on very good surfaces, good pitches, good wickets, good outfields. \u201cIf at any time we need a venue to play a Cup final during our domestic cricket season, we know that these venues are in good shape. At the same time, improving these facilities from Cave Hill up to St Philip gives the community a sense of pride with the World Cup coming to their neighbourhoods. They have facilities of a world class level,\u201d Coppin said. sheriabrathwaite@barbadostoday.bb", "summary": "<p>Event manager of the local organising committee (LOC) of the ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup, Wendell Coppin has announced that all systems are go at the three practice venues.

The girl's death was the first fatal crocodile attack in the Northern Territory since 2018. Wildlife rangers had been attempting to trap or shoot the crocodile since the girl was attacked in Mango Creek near Palumpa, an Outback indigenous community in the Northern Territory. They shot the animal on Sunday after getting permission from the region's traditional landowners. Police said that an analysis had confirmed the animal was the one that killed the girl. \"The events of last week have had a huge impact on the family and local police are continuing to provide support to everyone impacted,\" Senior Sergeant Erica Gibson said. Northern Territory-based crocodile scientist Grahame Webb said a reptile the size of the one shot had to be male and at least 30 years old.\n\nA man has been caught trying to smuggle more than 100 live snakes into the nation by cramming them into his trousers, customs officials said in a statement on Tuesday. The unnamed traveler was stopped by customs officers as he sought to exit Hong Kong and into the border city of Shenzhen, the statement said. \"Upon inspection, customs officers discovered that the pockets of the trousers the passenger was wearing were packed with six canvas drawstring bags and sealed with tape,\" it said. \"Once opened, each bag was found to contain living snakes in all kinds of shapes, sizes and colors.\" Officers seized 104 of the reptiles, including milk snakes and corn snakes, many of which were non-native species. An accompanying video showed two border agents peering into transparent plastic bags filled with squirming red, pink and white snakes. \"Those who break the rules will be ... held liable in accordance with the law,\" the statement said, without specifying the man's punishment.\n\nMore than 150 animals, nine of them one-horned rhinoceroses, have drowned in floods at the Kaziranga National Park in Assam state, authorities said. The Kaziranga National Park, with almost one-third of its camps flooded, is home to nearly half of the global population of one-horned rhinos, which stands at about 4,000. The weather department yesterday said that heavy rainfall is expected to lash northern and northeastern states for the next two or three days.\n\nA Hawaii airport on Tuesday was briefly evacuated after a Japanese man was found with two inert grenades in his hand luggage, police said following his arrest. Officers cleared the terminal while a bomb squad moved in to investigate the suspicious items, which were picked up on an X-ray machine. \"The Hilo International Airport experienced a brief halt in operations\" for little over an hour, Hawaii police said in a statement. The bomb squad \"determined the items to be inert grenades,\" police reported, meaning they were not dangerous. A 41-year-old Japanese man was arrested on a \"terroristic threatening\" charge and remains in custody, police said. \"Police remind the public that replicas of explosives, such as hand grenades, are prohibited in checked and carry-on baggage.\"", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taipei Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mango"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trousers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reptile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milk snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corn snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhinoceros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaziranga_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaziranga National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_bag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic bag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduced_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Introduced species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canvas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grenade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilo_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hilo International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeast India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_disposal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bomb disposal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.taipeitimes.com/assets/images/TaipeiTimesLogo-1200X1200px_new.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720532", "eventUri": "eng-9720532", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

They were literally crucified by this man, who looks like an angel, but he's really a devil,\" Trump told reporters in New York.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crucifixion of Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Telephony", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Lindenmayer_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Lindenmayer Systems", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/16_05_2024_09_52_50_9661367.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615315", "eventUri": "eng-9615315", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

(There is no evidence of Biden's involvement in the case.)\n\n\"This is all done by Biden and his people,\" Trump falsely claimed. \"This is done by Washington. No one has ever seen anything like this.\"\n\nTrump's allies have repeatedly made similar claims of election interference and a politically motivated prosecution, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who charged in a statement following the ruling that \"the weaponization of our justice system has been a hallmark of the Biden Administration.\"\n\nBiden's campaign called the speech \"unhinged\" in a statement.\n\n\"America just witnessed a confused, desperate, and defeated Donald Trump ramble about his own personal grievances and lie about the American justice system, leaving anyone watching with one obvious conclusion: This man cannot be president of the United States,\" said Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign's communications director. \"Unhinged by his 2020 election loss and spiraling from his criminal convictions, Trump is consumed by his own thirst for revenge and retribution. He thinks this election is about him. But it's not. It's about the American people: lowering their costs, protecting their freedoms, defending their democracy.\"\n\n\"That's what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are fighting for,\" Tyler continued. \"Donald

We should never allow anyone to tear it down. It's as simple as that. That's America. That's who we are,\" he said.\n\nThe president's comments came before he delivered a speech on the Middle East, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nFollowing more than 11 hours of deliberation, a panel of 12 jurors reached a unanimous verdict in the case at Manhattan Criminal Court, convicting the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on 34 first-degree counts of falsifying business records. These charges were related to a payment made to adult film entertainer Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election.\n\nThe Biden campaign released a statement on May 30 after a Manhattan jury convicted former President Donald Trump on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\n\"In New York today, we saw that no one is above the law,\" Biden-Harris 2024 communications director Michael Tyler said in the statement.\n\nHowever, the Biden team stated that the conviction would have minimal impact on the upcoming Republican nomination.\n\n\"Donald Trump has always mistakenly believed he would never face consequences for breaking the law for his own personal gain. But today's verdict does not change the fact that the American people face a simple reality. There is still only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: at the ballot box. Convicted felon or not, Trump will be the Republican nominee for president,\" Mr. Tyler said.\n\nThe White House also commented on the verdict with a brief statement on May 30.\n\n\"We respect the rule of law and have no additional comment,\" White House Counsel's Office spokesperson Ian Sams said in a statement.\n\nTo capitalize on the opportunity and boost fund-raising, the Biden campaign sent a text message to supporters requesting donations.\n\n\"If you have been waiting for the perfect time to make your first donation to Joe Biden's reelection campaign, we're here to tell you today is the day,\" the campaign wrote in the message.\n\nThe Biden team also warned that Donald Trump's supporters are so energized that they will likely set fundraising records for his campaign.\n\n\"So while the MAGA Right comes to the aid of Trump, Joe Biden -- and those who care about democracy -- need you,\" the message said.\n\n\"The threat Trump poses to our democracy has never been greater. He is running an increasingly unhinged campaign of revenge and retribution, pledging to be a dictator 'on day one' and calling for our Constitution to be 'terminated' so he can regain and keep power,\" he said.\n\n\"A second Trump term means chaos, ripping away Americans' freedoms and fomenting political violence -- and the American people will reject it this November.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/03/07/id5602896-Joe-Biden-GettyImages-2054036006-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615315", "eventUri": "eng-9615315", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 1682, "textEnd": 1688, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

They found Donald Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts,\" he said.\n\nThe president added that Trump will be given the same opportunity to appeal his conviction that is available to any convicted defendant.\n\n\"That's how the American system of justice works,\" he said.\n\nMr Biden's remarks came just hours after Trump appeared in the lobby of his eponymous skyscraper to deliver an unhinged rant in which he called the country he once led a \"fascist state\" and attack his enemies, including the judge who oversaw his hush money trial and the witnesses who testified against him.\n\nSpeaking to an audience of reporters and supporters in the lobby of his eponymous Fifth Avenue skyscraper in New York City -- the building where he formed the conspiracy that figured prominently in the evidence against him -- Trump falsely claimed that Mr Biden could put an end to the case that was brought against him by New York County District Attorney Alvin Bragg in a New York court.\n\n\"We have a president and a group of fascists that don't want to do anything about it. Because they could right now today, he could stop it -- but he's not,\" he said. He also attacked the judge who'd heard the case against him, calling him \"the devil\" and \"conflicted\".\n\nMr Biden directly addressed the ex-president's remarks, calling Trump's attacks on the justice system \"reckless, dangerous,\" and \"irresponsible\" for anyone to call a proceeding \"rigged\" as Trump did \"just because they don't like the verdict\".\n\n\"Our justice system has endured for nearly 250 years.

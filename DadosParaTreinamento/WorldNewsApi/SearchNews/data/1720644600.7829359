The Netflix series has become known for its extravagant costumes, and season 3 is no exception. While the show has previously drawn from historical references with the period-accurate silhouettes and corsets, this season they\u2019re including a few more contemporary references. Speaking with PEOPLE exclusively, Bridgerton costume designers John Glaser, George Sayer and Dougie Hawkes gave insight into all the real-life figures and time periods they looked at when creating each character\u2019s look. For Penelope\u2019s big transformation, in particular, they wanted to pay tribute to Old Hollywood icons, from her soft curls to her \u201csexier\u201d gowns. Additionally, they softened her color palette as she moved away from bright Featherington yellows to layers of green and blue, which was a clever nod to her family's color and Colin\u2019s Bridgerton blue. \u201cA little bit of that coloring also comes from [what] Dougie did for Colin when he comes back from Paris \u2014 he has a little bit of mint green in his cravat,\u201d Glaser points out. \u201cAnd she's picked up on that. That's why some of her coloring is influenced by him, because he's come back from Paris, we know that she's in love with him, so she's absorbed that a little bit.\u201d Read ahead for all the real-life figures who inspired the Bridgerton looks this season \u2014 from Jessica Rabbit to Audrey Hepburn. Penelope\u2019s Bridgerton Season 3 Look Inspired by Lauren Bacall and Jessica Rabbit For Penelope\u2019s (Nicola Coughlan) big season, the costume designers wanted to push her into a more mature look. To do that, they drew inspiration from the 1950s. Specifically, with her hair and makeup, they looked at Old Hollywood icons, including Lauren Bacall. \u201cWhen you look at photographs from Old Hollywood, the people just look great. Their hair looks great, they look great, but you don't really remember what they're wearing because it's all about their face and who they are,\u201d Glaser explains. \u201cThat's what we tried to do. We gave her a silhouette that looked great on her body, that helped mature her, make her look a little sexier than she has, and her hair is based on Lauren Bacall.\u201d Additionally, they drew inspiration from the cartoon bombshell Jessica Rabbit. This can definitely be seen in Penelope\u2019s \u201cglow-up\u201d moment as she wears a bold emerald green dress at the first ball of the season. However, the costume designers note that after her big debut is a failure, she retreats to a soften color palette. \u201cShe's the center of attention [at the ball] and it all goes wrong, [so] she retreats and suffers her palette right back so she can once again be back to being the wallflower to an extent,\u201d Sayer says. \u201cThe clothes aren't telling the story, she is.\u201d Colin\u2019s Bridgerton Season 3 Look Inspired by the Marlboro Man and \u201880s Rockers In contrast to the baby blues he wore in earlier seasons, this season shows a much more rugged side of Colin (Luke Newton), which was inspired by everything from cowboys to rockers. \u201cOf the three major brothers, he's the youngest. He's the baby, apart from Gregory. We deliberately kept him youthful [in earlier seasons],\u201d Hawkes explains. As Colin returns from his travels at the beginning of season 3, Hawkes adds that his look further showcases how he\u2019s grown up and learned about the world, from wearing a leather belt that wasn\u2019t seen in Regency London at the time to open shirts to show his sex appeal. Glaser notes that one reference they looked at was the Marlboro Man from the 1970s TV commercials, while Hawkes adds he was inspired by \u201880s rockers. \u201cMy growing up in costume history is really the '80s, so I was very much hooked up with the '80s pop culture scene and worked with a lot of bands at that time,\u201d Hawkes notes. \u201cSo I wanted to bring that back in personally for me, and I thought Colin was the ideal person to do that with.\u201d \u201cThere's a bit of heavy metal in him if you like, and there's a bit of new romanticism in him,\u201d Hawkes continues. \u201cBut I think we saw that long overcoat look come in with Armani in the early '90s. I wanted to get a bit of that in, because it's a very strong silhouette. So we worked on those little nuances and then presented it to Luke in the fitting room. I think a little smile came on his face when he saw himself grow up.\u201d Eloise\u2019s Bridgerton Season 3 Look Inspired by Audrey Hepburn This season, Eloise (Claudia Jessie) also goes through a dramatic transformation as she ditches her practical wardrobe for more feminine looks. As the costume designers put together her outfits, they looked specifically at the 1960s, including old films from that era. As many fans have pointed out, many of her looks parallel Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady, which Glaser says simply comes down to the fact that Eloise and Hepburn look very similar. \u201cWe say Audrey Hepburn and we think of Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady in the ascot scene, just because she looks like Eloise, and just elegant and simple,\u201d he notes. \u201cSome of that, I hate to say it, is just a natural thing. She has a certain body type, a certain face, a certain look, and certain things work well on certain people. She's like Audrey Hepburn.\u201d Francesca\u2019s Bridgerton Season 3 Look Inspired by Katharine Hepburn and Grace Kelly As Francesca (Hannah Dodd) makes her debut into society this season, the costume designers looked at notable figures ranging from the 1930s to the 1950s, including Grace Kelly and Katharine Hepburn. Specifically referencing the latter, Glaser notes that they looked at Hepburn\u2019s translucent shirts in Bringing Up Baby with Cary Grant. In the same way that Colin\u2019s looks were inspired by his travels, they wanted to do the same with Francesca this season as she makes her grand return to the screen. \u201cShe's been away just like Colin [and] she's come back,\u201d Glaser explains. \u201cWe didn't want her to follow the pattern of the rest of the family. So a sheer blouse is a little off and a little mysterious.\u201d John Stirling\u2019s Bridgerton Season 3 Look Inspired by Cary Grant A big surprise for book fans this season is the introduction of Francesca\u2019s love interest John Stirling (Victor Alli). Though the costume designers note that they didn\u2019t include any big Easter eggs about their romance in Francesca\u2019s attire, his look does perfectly complement hers. \u201cWe keep them quite classic and quite simple,\u201d Hawkes says of the couple\u2019s looks this season. \u201cI think the word classic is really good to describe both of them. We know he's a member of Parliament or he's in that world.\u201d \u201cHe's Cary Grant in a gray flannel suit, and she's Katharine Hepburn,\u201d Glaser perfectly adds. Cressida\u2019s Bridgerton Season 3 Look Inspired by the 1970s and Couture Fashion Aside from perhaps Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel), Cressida (Jessica Madsen) has some of the most dramatic looks this season, which Glaser teases has a deeper meaning. \u201cIt's part of her armor,\u201d Sayer notes. \u201cShe is on the marriage market for the third year, she's got loads of pressure. She's like a butterfly in a mausoleum. She's desperate to escape. She's a lot of fun as a character to work with and we can push things with her because of that.\u201d While the costume designers note they didn\u2019t look at specific figures for Cressida\u2019s attire, they did reference the \u201850s and \u201870s, as well as more modern-day runway looks. \u201cSome of her fabrics were right from the runway of last season or probably two seasons ago,\u201d Glaser reveals. \u201cJohn's got a good source for fabric, so we're finding dead stock or fabrics that we can't name the fashion houses, but a couple of her spencers are made with couture fabrics,\u201d Sayer adds.", "summary": "These are the inspirations behind all the season 3 looks, from Jessica Rabbit to Audrey Hepburn", "url": "https://people.com/bridgerton-season-3-costumes-inspired-by-real-people-exclusive-8659368", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/NvBWifHdopzsdZzYfLsvha7S9YE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(745x223:747x225)/bridgerton-style-penelope-tout-060624-657ce1bab4324a4bb06496fd8b425eba.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:00:00", "author": "Kelsie Gibson", "authors": ["Kelsie Gibson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.32}

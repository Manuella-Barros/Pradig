Thus, it came as no surprise that the Federal Reserve chose to keep its rates steady following its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting which concluded on May 1. In addition, it also left the door open as to when it would start cutting them.

However, said officials have since been telegraphing that cuts will probably occur later than previously anticipated. The Fed seems to have now shifted to a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach due to both sticky inflation and strong economic data. \u201cIn recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee\u2019s 2% inflation objective,\u201d Fed officials said in a May 1 statement. Indeed, inflation, which was on a downward trajectory, has picked up its pace once again \u2014 standing at 3.5%, according to the latest consumer price index (CPI) data released April 10.

Inflation and Biden\u2019s Quest For Re-Election With inflationary pressure top of mind for voters, presidential candidates are addressing rising prices as part of their campaigns. While President Joe Biden has undertaken several efforts to fight inflation \u2014 namely with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 \u2014 some experts argued that other factors came into play in bringing inflation down, as GOBankingRates previously reported. And opinions are split as to whether President Biden, if re-elected, would make a difference in alleviating prices. As J.T. Young wrote in an opinion piece on May 1 for The Hill: \u201cBiden does not have months to spare.\u201d \u201cHe has six \u2014 total \u2014 before November. While six may be a lifetime in politics, it is just two quarters in economics. It is the difference between chronological and geological time. Economists can wait; politicians cannot,\u201d wrote Young. And in terms of voters, half of those polled said they expect inflation to rise higher than it is now, according to a recent Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll. Here is what some economists had to say about the direction of inflation, were Biden to be re-elected. Inflation Will Continue To Moderate According to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, inflation will continue to moderate and return to the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation target early in Biden\u2019s potential second term. \u201cThis is due to the fading away of the impact of the pandemic on inflation, tight monetary policy and an easing in the job market, and the normalization of the growth in housing costs,\u201d said Zandi. Zandi added that Biden\u2019s policy efforts are designed to lift the supply side of the economy, and thus weigh on inflation. He noted, however, that these policies will play out over the next several years. Inflation Will Cool Off, But Rates Might Not \u2014 Hurting Prices William Luther, director of the American Institute for Economic Research\u2018s Sound Money Project and associate professor of economics at Florida Atlantic University \u2014 also argued that inflation will gradually return to the Fed\u2019s 2% target \u2014 adding that this will happen \u201cregardless of who wins in November.\u201d Now, he added, the only question is how high the Fed will have to hold interest rates to keep inflation in line with its 2% target. \u201cThe Biden administration appears committed to running large budget deficits in order to finance housing, family planning, child care, universal pre-K, family and medical leave, behavioral healthcare, students debt forgiveness, green energy initiatives, unionization efforts, Social Security Administration investments, and a host of other expenditures in its cradle-to-grave welfare system,\u201d said Luther. In turn, he argued, despite the end of many pandemic-era programs, the federal deficit increased to nearly $1.7 trillion in 2023 from $1.4 trillion in 2022. The Congressional Budget Office projects deficits will continue to rise in the years ahead. \u201cReasonable people might disagree about the desirability of Biden\u2019s spending plan,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is much less scope for disagreement on the effects it will have on long-term interest rates.\u201d According to him, when the government borrows to finance spending, it must bid funds away from private sector borrowers. This, in turn, puts upward pressure on interest rates. \u201cTo keep a lid on inflation, the Fed will have to target higher interest rates consistent with the government\u2019s additional borrowing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Fed does its job, inflation will be low and stable \u2014 but Americans will have to bear the costs of higher interest rates.\u201d More From GOBankingRates Barbara Corcoran: 3 Cities To Invest in Real Estate Now Before Prices Skyrocket3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000 This article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I\u2019m an Economist: Here Are My Predictions for Inflation If Biden Wins Again", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-economist-predictions-inflation-biden-201039156.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GbuFZjS.FMLGudDNALW4ug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/gobankingrates_644/f57267b50791c6aabd1f8f8310ae6951", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:56:40", "author": "Ya\u00ebl Bizouati-kennedy", "authors": ["Ya\u00ebl Bizouati-kennedy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.219}

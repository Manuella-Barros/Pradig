And let's just say she's come a long way.\n\nIn an excerpt obtained by Page Six on Sunday, Whoopi wrote:\n\n\"I had stayed pretty far away from drugs, except for pot, after getting cleaned up in the early 70s.\"\n\nRelated: Joy Behar Takes Barbra Streisand's Side In Melissa McCarthy Ozempic Scandal!\n\nAccording to The US Sun, the Little Rascals star battled a heroin addiction but managed to beat it with the help of her first husband Alvin Martin, who was also her drug counselor. But after she relocated from New York to California in the '80s to pursue her acting career, she spiraled into cocaine use at Hollywood parties. She wrote, per Page Six:\n\n\"I was invited to parties where I was greeted at the door with a bowl of Quaaludes from which I could pick what I wanted. Lines of cocaine were laid across tables and bathroom counters for the taking.\"\n\nJeez...\n\nThe 68-year-old claimed that people at the parties were \"very relaxed\" and that \"everyone partook\" because cops wouldn't raid the home of a \"big-time producer or actor.\"\n\nThat's WILD. She also said she felt cocaine use wasn't as \"dangerous\" in comparison to heroin, and that its accessibility led her down a troubled path.\n\nThe Sister Act star said she managed to continue working while hiding her addiction, until the drug began to \"kick [her] ass.\" She recalled one night in particular where she was paralyzed in fear while laying down because she believed some sort of monster was lurking underneath her bed. She wrote:\n\n\"So I didn't move out of bed for twenty-four hours. That kind of s**t doesn't end pretty. There's only so long a person can hold their bladder.\"\n\nOof. But that wasn't the moment she decided she needed to kick the habit... That came later.\n\nWhoopi revealed she had a \"slap in the face moment\" while staying at a luxurious hotel in Manhattan. Apparently, she was doing coke in the closet when a maid opened the door and screamed in fear. Whoopi ran out to explain herself but said she caught a glimpse of herself in a mirror -- and noticed her face was covered in the white powder. From that moment, she made a change, noting that she was able to straighten out her life \"quickly\" over fear of winding up dead:\n\n\"I knew I'd have to change out my friends and turn down invitations but I could do that.

The profound impact of the treatment resulted in her mother, Emma Harris, losing all memory of her two children, Whoopi and her older brother, Clyde Johnson.\n\n\"My mother at one point when I got older ... said, 'Can I tell you a secret?'

She said, 'Yeah, I had no idea who you were.'\"\n\n\"I said, 'So you carried this for 40 years?' She said, 'Well, what else was I going to do?'\" Goldberg added\n\n\"Living without my mother, who was always my world, who had always been that center of gravity. Suddenly the center of gravity wasn't there,\" she said of her mother's hospitalization. \"If I needed information, I was to ask somebody, explain why I was asking and do all the things that I would do with her when she was not there.\"\n\nHarris died in 2010 at age 78, and Whoopi's brother passed away five years later at age 65.\n\n\"Bits and Pieces: My Mother, My Brother, and Me\" hits bookshelves on May 7.", "source": {"uri": "eurweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EURweb"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ny_magee@eurweb.com", "name": "Ny MaGee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whoopi Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine_dependence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine dependence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methaqualone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Methaqualone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electroconvulsive therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center of mass"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://eurweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Collage-Maker-12-Sep-2023-09-31-AM-9539-e1694536320980.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541835", "eventUri": "eng-9541835", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2491, "textEnd": 2496}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Despite attempting to stay away from drugs, Goldberg says in the late 80's is when her life took a turn, especially while being in the Hollywood and New York scene. \"I was invited to parties where I was greeted at the door with a bowl of Quaaludes from which I could pick what I wanted,\" the Oscar winner recalled, per Page Six. \"Lines of cocaine were laid across tables and bathroom counters for the taking.\"\n\nRELATED: Whoopi Goldberg, 68, Defends Couples With Age Gaps While Revealing One Of Her Last Boyfriends Was 40 Years Older Than Her\n\nGoldberg described an environment where drug use was common and accepted, with the assurance that the homes of influential figures in the entertainment industry were safe from police raids. She believed that cocaine, being easily accessible, was harmless and initially thought she could control its use. Despite managing to conceal her drug habit and fulfill her professional obligations for about a year, Goldberg eventually opened up about her struggles with addiction.\n\nIn her memoir, Goldberg reflects on the intense depths of her cocaine dependency. She paints a vivid picture of experiencing frightening hallucinations, such as spotting a menacing creature lurking beneath her bed, causing her to become paralyzed with fear for a full day.\n\n\"I stayed put in bed for a whole day,\" she recounted. \"That kind of situation doesn't end well. There's a limit to how long a person can hold it in.\"\n\nAs her addiction spiraled out of control, the actress candidly revealed a pivotal moment of realization in a Manhattan hotel room, where a shocked housekeeper stumbled upon her engaging in drug use inside a closet.\n\nRELATED: Oop!

The View co-host said it was later on in the '80s that \"recreational drug use\" became the norm, as she hopped around from Hollywood hotspots to parties in New York.\n\n\"I was invited to parties where I was greeted at the door with a bowl of Quaaludes from which I could pick what I wanted,\" Goldberg said. \"Lines of cocaine were laid across tables and bathroom counters for the taking.\"\n\nThe Sister Act star explained that because partygoers knew that the cops weren't going to storm into a home of a \"big-time producer or actor,\" the fear of getting in trouble simply wasn't there, creating an environment she said was \"very relaxed\" allowing \"everyone\" to partake.\n\nGoldberg said she felt she could \"handle\" the drug, taking copious amounts of cocaine, which she deemed less \"dangerous\" at the time, due in part to its accessibility for the rich and famous set.\n\nShe would go on to use heavily for about a year -- even while working -- and continued showing up to set on time with no issues, until one day, things took at turn.\n\nWriting that cocaine started to \"kick [her] ass,\" Goldberg said she began hallucinating, and at one point, believed she saw a dangerous creature lurking under her bed that would try to attack her if she got up.\n\n\"So I didn't move out of bed for twenty-four hours,\" the Oscar-winner recounted. \"That kind of s--t doesn't end pretty. There's only so long a person can hold their bladder.\"\n\nThe wake up call for Goldberg came during a stay in a fancy NYC hotel, where she recalled doing the drug while in the closet of her hotel room, only to get surprised by a hotel housekeeper, who she said came in, opened the closet door and screamed.\n\nGoldberg said she leaped up and explained it was her room, but when she saw her face in the mirror, understood what the scream was a bout -- she had cocaine smeared across her face.\n\nWhile she knew going cold turkey wouldn't be easy, she knew at the moment, she would have to stop using, something she writes she was \"lucky\" enough stop doing fairly \"quickly.\"\n\n\"I knew I'd have to change out my friends and turn down invitations but I could do that,\" she recalled. \"I didn't want to die.\"", "source": {"uri": "toofab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Toofab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whoopi Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The View (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Act_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sister Act (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methaqualone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methaqualone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeted", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closeted"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_turkey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold turkey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images.toofab.com/image/d6/16by9/2024/05/06/d6d7a0eba75f4683853e63c5e082739d_xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541835", "eventUri": "eng-9541835", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

She is in the news for her upcoming new memoir, Bits and Pieces: My Mother, My Brother, and Me,\" where she opens up about a tragic time in her childhood when her mother forgot Goldberg. Keep scrolling for the deets.\n\nFor the unversed, Whoopi was born Caryn Elaine Johnson and is one of the few entertainers to win the EGOT, short form for Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony awards. She got her breakthrough in acting with the movie The Color Purple. She received her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in the fantasy film Ghost. Goldberg is also an accomplished voice actor who has lent her voice in 1994's The Lion King and Toy Story 3.\n\nAccording to USA Today's report, Whoopi Goldberg appeared in an interview on The View. She revealed at around eight years of age, her mother was hospitalized for two years after a mental breakdown. However, the upsetting part was that she did not remember Whoopi when she returned from the hospital. The Ghost actress was unaware of it. Whoopi recalled, \"For me, it was like, 'Oh, so they've taken her to this hospital, and no one's going to tell me anything, and I can't go see her.'\"\n\nWhoopi Goldberg mentioned that her mother was given electroshock therapy while she was hospitalized. She revealed, \"My grandfather and my dad OK'd that my mother get the shock treatment for two years.\" She explained that a woman's husband, brother, or any man involved in the woman's life could make the medical decisions for them back then.\n\nIn another interview with People magazine, Whoopi Goldberg revealed that when she got older, her mother confessed that she didn't know who Whoppi was after returning from the hospital. The Color Purple star said, \"She said, 'Yeah, I had no idea who you were. I just knew I never wanted to go back to that hospital. So I had to do everything I could. If they said the sky was green, and I could see it wasn't green, and it was blue, I'd say, 'Yes, the sky is green.'\"\n\nWhoopi Goldberg also shared that she was lucky to grow up with her mother in NYC.

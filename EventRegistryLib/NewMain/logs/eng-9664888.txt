Sea and Taiwan Strait.\n\nSince coming to power in 2012, Xi has waged a broad campaign against corruption among Communist Party and government officials, with the PLA being one of his main targets.\n\nYou might be interested: China and Philippines exchange accusations over maritime collision in South China Sea", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Liberation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Purge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Weidong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "He Weidong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Shangfu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Li Shangfu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army_Rocket_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "People's Liberation Army Rocket Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Youxia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zhang Youxia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leninism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(military)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (military)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corruption_campaign_under_Xi_Jinping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Military_Commission_(China)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Military Commission (China)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Strait", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan Strait"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mao Zedong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese economic reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Conferences_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Conferences and Events", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.escenariomundial.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/xi-jinping-partido-comunista_.jpg?fit=1279%2C1280&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664888", "eventUri": "eng-9664888", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

He also said the \"soil that breeds corruption\" should be eradicated by improving the policing of graft and supervision of senior cadres, according to the report.\n\nXi was speaking at a so-called military political work conference in the city of Yan'an, a stronghold of the Communist Party in central China's Shaanxi province during the civil war.\n\nXi used a similar meeting in 2014 to assert his authority over the People's Liberation Army shortly after coming to power. That event was intended to echo a gathering in 1929 when Mao Zedong maneuvered to bring the armed forces under Communist Party control. In 2015, Xi kicked off a major modernization of the military aimed at improving its combat readiness.\n\nUnderscoring the importance of the gathering in 2014, the PLA Daily earlier this month credited Xi with saving the armed forces from problems including graft, a weakening of leadership and lack of discipline.\n\nXi has however struggled to eliminate corruption -- at least a dozen senior military officials were removed from their posts in a crackdown last year.\n\nFormer Defense Minister Li Shangfu was also mysteriously ousted after just seven months on the job, the shortest tenure for someone in that position since the People's Republic was founded in 1949. There hasn't been any formal announcement of a probe into Li.\n\nUS intelligence officials believe Xi's military purge came after it emerged that corruption undermined his efforts to modernize the armed forces and raised questions about China's ability to fight a war.

Its most recent use appeared in the 1960 Cultural Revolution tract \"Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung.\"\n\nPrior to the Yanan meeting, Mr. Xi called on the military to resurrect Mao's theory of \"continuous revolution\" -- a key communist tenet used to stave off ideological complacency. Mr. Xi has also called his anti-corruption campaigns a \"self-revolution,\" another term used by Mao.\n\nMr. Xi now wields a level of power and control not seen since Mao, who died in 1976.\n\nThe meeting in Yanan included key PLA officials and political commissars tasked with imposing strict ideological conformity within the Chinese military, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua.\n\nMr. Xi told the military officials that the conference marked a return to the roots of the military. The gathering was billed by state media as a CMC political work conference held from Monday to Wednesday.\n\nThe session included a visit by Mr. Xi to the residences in the city used by revolutionary leaders, including Mao, Zhou Enlai and military commander Zhu De in Yanan, during the civil war that brought the communists to power in 1949.\n\nMao is regarded by academic analysts as one of the most notorious mass murders in history based on policies that led to the deaths of tens of millions of Chinese through executions, forced labor and government-produced famines.\n\nThe speech addressed a number of issues ranging from global geopolitical challenges to Mr. Xi's effort to overhaul the PLA into a major international force by 2027.\n\nThe PLA is confronted with ideological challenges and therefore political loyalty within the military must be strengthened to ensure \"core values,\" Mr. Xi said.\n\nProblems within the military are the result of a lack of ideals and beliefs, he said.\n\nIdeologically, the Chinese leaders told the assembled PLA officials that they must never lose the communist revolutionary fervor of CCP founders and must stay loyal to the party while preparing to confront an unstable and rapidly changing world.\n\n\"At present, we face complex and profound changes in the world, country, party and the army,\" Mr. Xi was quoted as saying.\n\n\"Politically, we must incessantly promote politics in our army-building as our military face sophisticated and unparalleled challenges so that we can ensure the nature and principles of the people's army will never change, and we can always dare to fight and win,\" he said.\n\nPLA cadres, including the most senior leaders must \"dare to lose face and face up to their own shortcomings and flaws ... make earnest rectifications, resolve problems that are deeply rooted in their thinking,\" he said.\n\nOn corruption, the Chinese leader highlighted that despite more than a decade of anti-corruption efforts, the problem persists, including within the military.\n\n\"And we must make it clear that there is no place for any corrupt elements in the military,\" he said, adding that \"hotbeds and conditions that breed corruption\" need to be eliminated.\n\nGreater checks and balances are needed along with the use of a \"toolbox for punishing new types of corruption and hidden corruption,\" he said.\n\nGreater supervision of high-ranking officers and their use of power is needed, he said.\n\nThe CCP has purged dozens of senior PLA officials in an ongoing anti-corruption campaign that many analysts outside China view as more likely a bid by Mr. Xi to solidify political control over the military.\n\nLast year, Defense Minister Li Shangfu was abruptly removed with no official explanation.\n\nNine other senior PLA generals, including senior commanders of the PLA Rocket Force, the former air force commander and a few CMC officials with the Equipment Development Department in charge of defense procurement were purged in December.\n\nThe U.S. intelligence community's annual threat assessment made public earlier this year said that corruption within the PLA has increased Chinese leaders' concerns about the capabilities and reliability of the military.\n\nAn investigation into corruption related to the strategic missile forces also resulted in the dismissals of three senior Chinese aerospace executives from a senior advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.\n\nEarlier in 2014 and 2015, two former vice chairmen of the CMC, Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, were fired, reportedly for corruption-related offenses.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The appearance came next month ahead of the third plenum of the Communist Party Central Committee, which is expected to set China's economic and reform priorities for the coming years.\n\nThe Xinhua report points out that the conference was initiated by Xi, who is chairman of the CMC, the PLA's top decision-making body.\n\nXi's speech, which covered a range of issues from global geopolitical challenges to the modernization of the PLA, echoed one he delivered a decade ago in Gutian, Fujian province, which heralded a overhaul of the PLA and acceleration of its modernization campaign.\n\nOn Monday, Xi told PLA elites that they should never forget the revolutionary spirit of the Communist Party's founders, remain loyal to the party and prepare for an unstable and rapidly changing world.\n\nAt present, we are facing complex and profound changes in the world, in the country, in the party and in the army, he said. Politically, we must continually promote politics in building our army as our military faces sophisticated and unprecedented challenges so that we can ensure that the nature and principles of the people's army will never change and that we can always dare to fight and win.\n\nTo win, Xi said senior cadres must be willing to do deep introspection and face their own shortcomings.\n\n[PLA] Cadres at all levels, especially the top echelons, must come forward, dare to lose face and face their own shortcomings and shortcomings, make serious rectifications, and resolve the problems that are deeply rooted in their thinking, a Xi said.\n\nHe added that the top brass must eliminate the breeding grounds and conditions that fuel corruption by improving the distribution of power and operational mechanisms of checks and balances, enriching the toolbox to punish new types of corruption and the hidden corruption and strengthening overall supervision of senior officials. officers in their performance and use of power.\n\nXi made no mention of individuals in his speech, which comes after the dismissal of dozens of senior PLA officials since last year. Former Defense Minister Li Shangfu was abruptly dismissed from his post in October, without the reasons for his dismissal having been announced.\n\nIn addition, nine senior generals, including former or current commanders of the PLA Rocket Force (PLARF), the former commander of the Air Force, and some officials of the Central Military Commission of the Equipment Development Department responsible for development of equipment and purchasing, were disqualified from their positions. the National People's Congress in December. Their deletions also remain unexplained.\n\nThe SCMP reported last year that Beijing had launched a wide-ranging anti-corruption investigation focused on the leadership of the PLARF, a key part of the country's nuclear arsenal. In December, investigations led to the dismissal of three senior Chinese aerospace and defense officials from China's top advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and a prominent Chinese rocket scientist was also expelled from the CPPCC in January.\n\nThe military is one of the main targets of Xi's sweeping anti-corruption campaign. The decade-long effort saw the fall of top military leaders like Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou, both former vice presidents of the CMC, in 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe Conference on Political Work is part of the series of meetings of the Central Military Commissions on important issues, as political work is always the lifeline of the PLA.\n\nIn 2014, Xi chaired an expanded CMC policy work conference with delegates from across the PLA in Gutian, Fujian province. This meeting echoes that of 1929 held at the same place by Mao Zedong, during which the Communist Party established the principle according to which the party commands the arms.", "source": {"uri":

For China, the aim of defence diplomacy is to bolster the overall national foreign policy, influence the global security environment, and enable the modernisation of the armed forces. Analysts have also observed that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) deploys military diplomacy to obtain intelligence, improve combat skills, and compare its capabilities vis-\u00e0-vis other militaries.\n\nThe following paragraphs discuss the drivers of China's defence diplomacy.\n\nChina's external outlook was for long restrained by former leader Deng Xiaoping's guiding principle, \"t\u0101o gu\u0101ng y\u01ceng hu\u00ec (to hide one's strengths, and bide one's time)\". In 2003, the Communist Party of China (CPC) proposed the notion of China's 'peaceful rise (h\u00e9p\u00edng ju\u00e9q\u01d0)', and in Hu Jintao's presidency, the slogans of 'harmonious world (h\u00e9xi\u00e9 sh\u00ecji\u00e8)' and 'peaceful development (h\u00e9p\u00edng f\u0101zh\u01cen)' took precedence. Since Xi Jinping became president in 2013, China appears to have abandoned Deng's dictum. In the past decade, as China has grown to become the world's second largest economy, Xi has been working to strengthen his country's military capability, declaring China's twin goals of \"rich nation and strong army.\"\n\nIn October 2014, the CPC organised a conclave on the theme of \"diplomacy towards the periphery\", which resolved to grow China's influence in the country's peripheral regions. The gathering also pledged to capitalise on the \"strategic opportunity\" to realise the rise of China. In the same conclave, the CPC hierarchy declared their ambition for \"China to be a defender of the Asia-Pacific order\" by 2050. In 2015, a White Paper on Defence urged the PLA to expand military and security cooperation with the armed forces of other nations to create a security environment favourable to China's peaceful development.\n\nIn 2023, Xi completed a decade at the helm of the Central Military Commission (CMC) that oversees the CPC's vast military. According to Chinese experts, Xi's reforms, in which the land-based army is being pruned in favour of improving aerial, naval and strategic service branches, constitute the largest overhaul of the PLA since the 1990s. In China's mind, attaining dominance in the air, space, and cyber domains will allow it to project power and protect its interests overseas.\n\nXi has also stated that the Party has the right to use force to bring Taiwan back to the fold and complete the \"reunification\" of China; it is therefore important for the PLA to become a superior fighting force. In parallel, China seeks to delegitimise the United States (US) by portraying its military alliances in Asia as a danger to stability, reinforced by Foreign Minister Wang Yi's exhortation to US allies such as South Korea to develop a sense of autonomy.\n\nThe PLA's Role in China's Global Strategy\n\nIn 2015, at the All-Army Foreign Affairs Work Conference and the Military Attaches Work Conference, Xi underscored the priorities for the PLA to fully implement the CPC's key diplomatic policies. He added that military diplomacy has taken on a heightened role in the country's overall national diplomacy and security strategy.\n\nA turning point came in 2020 as the PLA re-evaluated its role. The fifth plenum of the CPC's 19th Central Committee assessed that there were \"changes not seen in a century\" -- alluding to America's decline in the world order -- and that it needed to use this opportunity to become a great power. During the plenum, the Party announced that defence modernisation would be among the country's most important tools to fulfil its goals of \"rich nation and strong army\". The Party surmised that such modernisation would boost the PLA's ability to help fulfill the country's development goals, defend its sovereignty, and promote national security. According to Junfei Wu of the Hong Kong-based think tank Tianda Institute, it was perhaps the first time that the PLA had been considered with respect to the CPC's development goals. Song Zhongping, a Chinese analyst tracking the military, posited that the objective of the defence modernisation was to place the Chinese military on a par with the US army by 2027, which marks the PLA's centenary.\n\nIn 2022, as head of the CMC, Xi signed a directive on the PLA's tasks other than war, in which he emphasised that the military should safeguard the country's national sovereignty, security, and developmental interests. The PLA, therefore, occupies an elevated position in the CPC's global grand strategy. Unlike other nations where the national armies serve the state, the PLA owes its allegiance to the CPC.\n\nUnder Xi, China's defence engagements have increased when compared across the metrics of military exercises, interactions of the military brass, and naval port calls. In 2012 and 2013, there were, respectively, 12 and 15 military exercises with other states. The number steadily climbed over the following years, dropping during the COVID-19 pandemic due to restrictions on movement globally.\n\nEngagements of senior military officers abroad increased from 92 in 2012 to 129 in 2015; and Navy port calls rose from to 17 (2012) to 45 in 2017, the same year that China announced its first overseas naval base in Djibouti in East Africa.\n\nConsidering China's aspiration to be \"a defender of the Asia-Pacific order\" by 2050, Asia is an important priority for its defence diplomacy engagements that reached over 1,000 between 2002 and 2021. This is followed by Europe and Africa, at 606 and 334, respectively, over the same period.\n\nOf the 1,104 defence-diplomacy engagements within the continent between 2002 and 2021, China had more with countries in South-East Asia (48 percent of the total number) and South Asia (26 percent) as compared to Central Asia (13 percent) and North-East Asia (13 percent). These numbers are underpinned by geopolitical and economic factors.\n\nIn South Asia, for example, Pakistan accounts for a bulk of the PLA's interactions, mainly due to the India-Pakistan and India-China contestations. Chinese scholars describe the rivalry between India and China as \"complex\", given how both perceive themselves to be rising powers. China finds utility in Pakistan in its effort to balance India, with the PLA leveraging the combat experience of the Pakistani Army that has fought against the Indian Army in a number of direct conflicts.\n\nThe Indian Ocean and South China Sea are key corridors for China's energy requirements from West Asia, and China's trade with Africa that accounts for the strategic salience of South and Southeast Asia for the PLA. In addition to hard power, the Chinese state also seeks to leverage relationships through soft power in the form of humanitarian and relief missions through PLA's medical vessels such as 'Peace Ark'. The ship, equipped with advanced medical facilities and having medical professionals among its crew, can tend to nearly 1,000 patients at a time. During the last 16 years, the vessel has visited 43 regions and nations, providing medical treatment to some 250,000 people. Both constant defence engagements and benign soft-power initiatives aid in the PLA's understanding of the security situation in those regions.\n\nChina's Perceptions of Warfare and Neighbourhood Threats\n\nFor the PLA, China faces difficult challenges due to the campaign of containment by the US and its allies. It is of the view that warfare in modern times is dependent on a state's overall national strength, not just on military capability. China should thus build the PLA's capabilities through continuous military engagement and exercises with other armies, international tours of duty involving peacekeeping missions, and through induction of advanced technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to the reading of some Chinese scholars, the aim of American policy towards China has been to suppress it; in the recent years under Biden, the US has worked to attract allies and form blocs in this regard. This includes, according to the PLA, mediating a rapprochement between South Korea and Japan after a hiatus of more than a decade. Chinese analysts view a threat in such a resumption of friendly relations, and is gearing up the PLA to be vigilant amid regular military drills between the US, Japan, and South Korea. The same analysts anticipate that military cooperation in Asia between these three countries could serve as a foundation for the 'Five-Eyes' intelligence-sharing arrangement between the US, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. The perception is that the US will cement a NATO-like trilateral military bloc and intelligence-pooling arrangement in Asia, and that a \"perilous\" nuclear arms race in China's backyard could emerge; Chinese observers point to a recent agreement whereby the US can deploy US nuclear-armed submarines in South Korean waters.\n\nThus, China sees that amid its contest with the US, the latter is invigorating its historical alliances. In contrast, as China watchers argue, China is a \"partial power\" since its security presence overseas has not evolved in the same manner as traditional great powers on the metrics of formalising alliances, stationing troops abroad, projecting power globally, or fighting conflicts either on its own or through proxy actors. China has no allies, but its most proximate relationships are with nations like Russia, North Korea and Pakistan that are regarded as \"rogue states\" with great amount of deficit in trust from the international community. Russia, for instance, is a neighbour with which China has to deal with, but not a partner that it can rely on. Despite Xi signing a no-limits partnership with Russia, analysts say, China must distance itself from Putin in the aftermath of the Ukraine aggression.\n\nDefence Engagement as Bedrock of China's Global Security Initiative\n\nChinese strategists argue that in the current scenario there must be an effort to redress the security deficit. China has made a case that influence between 'East and West', 'South and North' are evolving in a balanced direction, amid a global shift in the balance of power as the West declines and the East rises. There is a \"bloc mindset\" as far as China is concerned, reinforced by a \"new Cold War\" with states asserting supremacy through belligerent action. With China's assessment that American supremacy is in decline and its rise is inevitable, it is moving in to fill the security deficit.\n\nSoon after the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out, Xi announced the Global Security Initiative (GSI) in April 2022, referencing the concept of \"indivisible security\" -- i.e., that the security of one nation cannot come at the expense of another's; he warned that there were efforts to build \"small circles\" (read: power blocs) or provoke conflict along ideological lines. A year later, China announced plans to train 5,000 security personnel from developing countries over the next five years.\n\nBeijing plans to create more international platforms for exchange and cooperation to address security challenges in areas such as counterterrorism, cybersecurity, biosecurity, and emerging technologies, with a view to improving governance capacity in non-traditional security. China has announced more exchanges and cooperation among university-level military and law-enforcement academies. China's efforts to boost multilateral and bilateral security training programmes have expanded in recent years, spreading to countries in the Pacific Islands and Central Asia. Through such capacity-building programmes, China looks to build links with the security and military elites in other nations.\n\nLinking Security and Economic Cooperation\n\nWhile defence diplomacy is being consolidated through institutionalised mechanisms like the GSI, there is also a greater resonance of the national security in China's domestic discourse. Xi has emphasised averting risks to China's modernisation and incorporating the security element in every domain as some of the requirements of his conceptualisation of national security. Xi launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, which Xue Li from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences then stated was a route for China to transform itself from a regional power with global influence to a global power possessing comprehensive strength. Wang Yiwei from China's Renmin University compared BRI to the US's post-Second World War Marshall Plan, stating that it was an opportunity for China to use its economic growth for the greater good of the global community as opposed to Western-style globalisation that was unsustainable.\n\nAs Chinese human capital and corporate entities began to operate in foreign lands, Guo Xiaobing from China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations posited that it was imperative for China to improve its capability to protect its nationals residing overseas since it had a bearing on China's economic security. This must also be seen in context with Xi's 2022 directive, discussed earlier in this brief, that the security establishment should protect China's development interests. Indeed, there have been reported attacks on Chinese nationals in recent times. In April 2022, three Chinese educators attached to Karachi's Confucius Center, a Chinese-language training institute, were killed in a suicide bombing for which a group from Pakistan's Balochistan province claimed responsibility. Local groups are said to be behind several attacks on Chinese nationals working in Balochistan, where the Gwadar port and other large-scale infrastructure projects backed by China under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor are located. Earlier, in November 2021, the Solomon Islands witnessed disturbances in a locality predominantly populated by Chinese nationals, following allegations that then Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare was influencing legislative voting using Chinese funds.\n\nThese incidents show that China cannot avoid getting entangled in local political currents as it expands to new territories, and its interests may collide with those of other actors. This also means that China cannot rely solely on the assurances of foreign governments to secure its economic interests. Thus, during the BRI Security Cooperation Dialogue in 2017, Guo Shengkun, then Minister for Public Security floated the idea that countries which have signed up for the BRI should set up common security and cooperative security mechanisms for the projects. The Ministry of Public Security has been tasked with creating a law-enforcement cooperation mechanism \"bearing Chinese characteristics\".\n\nIn Solomon Islands, China has announced that its Export-Import Bank is providing US$66 million for building communication infrastructure, with the project being executed by Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. Port Honiara in the archipelago is being developed by the China Civil Engineering Construction Company, a state-owned enterprise. The two sides also signed a security cooperation agreement in July 2023, under which they pledged to institute and improve high-level exchanges between governments, legislatures, political outfits and sub-national authorities, and establish a mechanism to share governance best practices and enhance \"political trust\". The deal also seeks to improve cooperation on law enforcement and security issues, with China pledging to assist Solomon Islands in its policing and law-enforcement capacity.\n\nChina's security cooperation is also being driven by competitive international politics as seen in the case of Vietnam. In November 2023, Hanoi and Tokyo raised their ties to one of 'comprehensive strategic partnership'. In September 2023, US President Joe Biden made a state visit to Vietnam, following which ties with Washington were elevated to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership'. Xi, for his part, travelled to Vietnam in December 2023 to push for cooperation on security.\n\nJapan's and the US's efforts to woo Vietnam pose challenges to China more so because the two Communist nations fought a war in 1979, and there were border skirmishes in 1988 too. The agreement that China and Vietnam inked in December 2023 foresees high-level law enforcement exchanges and institutes a dialogue mechanism for political and security issues at the level of Deputy Minister. The agreement signed between the two nations refers to \"risks of colour revolution\" posed by \"hostile forces\", which will be combatted through the installation of a hotline between the public security departments of the two countries. It is expected to boost cooperation between China's law enforcement and security departments and Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security in the fields of personnel training, security, and intelligence-sharing.\n\nTo be sure, there is greater awareness about the implications of China pushing security cooperation in different parts of the world. In 2022, at the Raisina Dialogue, India's premier conclave on geopolitics, Andrew Shearer, Director General of Australia's Office of National Intelligence, warned that China's push for security cooperation with nations like Solomon Islands could potentially lead to greater Chinese military presence around Australia, and that China was organising diplomatic, military, and economic instruments to draw smaller countries into its fold. At a time when China is enhancing its defence diplomacy through initiatives like the GSI, there is backlash building against the activities of Chinese agencies operating beyond national jurisdictions.\n\nThere is now evidence of the global reach of Chinese law-enforcement agencies, with nearly 40 Ministry of Public Security officials being charged by the US government of targeting people residing in the US via social media for advocating views that are not in consonance with those of the Chinese regime, engaging in disruptive events marking the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, and for advocating for democracy on the mainland. In South Korea, intelligence agencies and police have launched an enquiry into the functioning of illegal police stations in Seoul and Jeju Island that are said to be acting at the behest of the Chinese government. Meanwhile, in Thailand, the government's plan to deploy Chinese police patrols to improve tourist confidence has led to fears that it may be used to target dissidents.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is hardly any doubt that security plays a bigger role in China's grand strategy in the Xi era, on account of the following factors: First, the changing nature of the Party-state's army, which after reforms seeks to project its capability beyond China's borders. There is also an expectation from Xi that the PLA must become more relevant in military diplomacy, safeguarding development interests and sovereignty.\n\nThe PLA's external engagements are also changing across metrics of military exercises, interactions of the military brass, and naval port calls. Greater engagement through defence diplomacy allows Chinese policymakers to gain better insights into the security environment in different regions. Chinese strategists have written extensively on their perceptions of threats posed by the Western-led alliance and its determination of strengthening alliances in Asia. China watchers, meanwhile, argue that China is a partial power and its security presence overseas has not evolved in the same manner as the traditional powers on the metrics of formalising alliances, stationing troops abroad, projecting power globally, or fighting in conflicts on its own or through proxy actors.\n\nThe favoured narrative in China is that the West is declining and the East is rising, and that there are deficits in security and governance due to the decline of the Western-led order. It is moving to fill the security void, through the Global Security Initiative which seeks to train law-enforcement personnel in developing nations. Further, over the last decade, China's economic interests have gone global with the expanding footprint of its flagship BRI. China is weaving in economic, military, and diplomatic elements into its grand strategy, and there is greater contestation in the international system to rework the balance of power.

There should be no room in the military for corrupt elements to hide, Xi said.\n\nThe choice of Yanan as the venue for the conference has strong historical symbolism. It is here that the revolutionary leader Mao Zedong spent over a decade rebuilding Red Army and prepare for the Long March which resulted in the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.\n\nMr. Taylor Fravelprofessor and director of the security studies program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, commented to Wall Street Journal that in recent years the PLA has been plagued by corruption scandals and purges at the highest levels. Fravel told the US newspaper that Xi could have taken inspiration from the Russian president's mediocre achievements Vladimir Poutine in Ukraine, which military experts attribute in part to widespread corruption. As the Russian invasion taught us, a corrupt force is likely to severely underperform on the battlefield.go to Fravel.\n\nXi personally decided to convene this week's meeting, according to Xinhua.\n\nTraveling to Yanan was a way to trace our roots, Xi said. Although the prospects are bright in the vision of forging a strong army, he said: the mission is arduous.\n\nThe Yanan meeting is reminiscent of the energetic attempt to XI for the eradication of corruption in 2014, during his visit Gutien to honor a historic military conference that took place 85 years earlier, in 1929.\n\nAt this moment, Xi led anti-corruption offensive within the PLA, which helped him assert control over China's politically influential military establishment and advance a broad agenda to transform a Soviet-style army into a 21st-century fighting force.

Participants listened to Xi's instructions, held roundtable discussions and shared their thoughts at the event, which concluded on Wednesday.\n\nThe last time such a meeting took place was in 2014, with senior officers gathering in Gutian, Fujian province. It was the first time the military held a high-level political work conference since Xi became general secretary in late 2012.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Central_Military_Commission_(China)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairman of the Central Military Commission (China)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Military_Commission_(China)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Military Commission (China)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaanxi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shaanxi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan'an", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yan'an"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yan'an"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fujian"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fujian"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202406/20/667307efa31095c551b3b6c0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664888", "eventUri": "eng-9664888", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

A number of senior leaders of the People's Liberation Army's Rocket Corps, including the head of China's nuclear arsenal, had also been fired by Xi in July.\n\nYan'an is also where Mao launched a major \"rectification\" campaign, purging his opponents from party ranks.\n\nCommentators told RFA that the choice of Yan'an as a venue for Xi's speech sent out a strong symbolic message.\n\nXi told the political work conference in Shaanxi province that \"the armed forces must always be led by those who are reliable and loyal to the party,\" Xinhua reported.\n\nHe warned of \"deep-seated problems\" in the military due to a \"lack of ideals and beliefs.\"\n\nUseful propaganda tool\n\nCommunist troops arrived in Yan'an, on the poverty-stricken loess plateau of the Yellow River, in 1935, making their homes in caves and eating millet gruel every day until the tide swung their way in the civil war in 1948.\n\nThe Yan'an period of Chinese history is a useful propaganda tool, because it came before the power struggles and political campaigns launched by Mao against his opponents threw the country into years of turmoil and cost millions of lives, and still carries a message of hope for many Chinese people.\n\nCurrent affairs commentator Cai Shenkun said Xi's message was clear.\n\n\"He is emphasizing the importance of who it is holding the gun,\" Cai said. \"It used to be said that the party should command the gun, but the key question is, who is actually holding it?\"\n\n\"Mao Zedong ruled the party with guns, Deng Xiaoping did the same,\" he said in a reference to Mao's successor who ordered the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre by People's Liberation Army forces in Beijing.\n\nWife promoted\n\nMeanwhile, Xi has reportedly promoted his wife Peng Liyuan, a former military singer who holds the rank of major-general, to a senior position in the Central Military Commission's Cadre Assessment Committee, which approves appointments, according to senior political commentator Willy Lam.\n\n\"Peng's increasing public profile and potential elevation within the military hierarchy invites comparisons to Mao Zedong's reliance on his fourth wife, Jiang Qing, during the Cultural Revolution,\" Lam wrote in a commentary last month for the Jamestown Foundation .\n\nCai said it is significant that the conference is being held ahead of the third plenum of the Central Committee next month, and can be seen as a message that Xi is strengthening his grip on the military.\n\nCurrent affairs commentator Guo Min agreed, saying that party control over the armed forces is a recurrent concern for Xi.\n\n\"He's talking about the absolute leadership of the party over the military, which basically means, his absolute command over the military,\" Guo said.\n\n\"Political work is actually about toeing the line, the same line as [Xi],\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "rfa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Free Asia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

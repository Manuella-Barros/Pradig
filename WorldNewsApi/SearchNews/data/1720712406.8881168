The former TOWIE star, 32, organised an incredible party for her partner with celebrity guests including Ashley James and her boyfriend Tommy. Lucy looked stunning in a summery one-shoulder yellow dress and gold heels as she shared a glimpse at the celebrations on her Instagram. Lucy and Ryan posed for a snap with Tommy and Ashley who wore a beautiful light pink ruffled dress. Ryan looked jazzy in a multicoloured patterned skirt for the party which he teamed with beige chinos. Guests at the bash were treated to a three-course dinner of oysters, steak and salmon before musical guests got the real party started with singing and dancing. The table settings were beautiful and personalised to each guest with their name attached to the napkin. Ryan's brother Love Island star Scott was also in attendance and shared images of the family lunch the previous day. At the dinner table were Lucy and Ryans's two children Lilah, two, and four-year-old Roman. Sharing her snaps of the big weekend Ashley penned in her social media caption: 'We came on our first childfree weekend away to celebrate @ryanthomas84 40th birthday and it was so much fun!\u2600\ufe0f. 'One of the funnest nights ever celebrating you @ryanthomas84 ! What an amazing bunch of people! 'You're very loved! @lucymeck1 you smashed every detail - please can you organise all parties going forward!' Other Instagram footage showed the crowds of guests enjoying drinks and canap\u00e9s ahead of the dinner. It comes after Lucy opened up about her struggle with endometriosis and adenomyosis, which cause her to bloat '80 per cent of the time'. Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows in other places, such as the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Meanwhile, adenomyosis is a gynecologic condition that causes endometrial tissue in the lining of the uterus to grow into the muscular wall of the uterus. Lucy opened up about having the 'severe' condition recently as she told her followers it has 'really affected her' since having Lilah. The mother of two said that she was surprised by the diagnosis because her symptoms didn't include period pain and fertility issues, which are typically associated with endometriosis. Sharing a picture of This Morning doing a segment on the condition, Lucy praised them for raising awareness on the topic. She wrote: 'Well done This Morning. For something so common in women there really isn't much information out there & as I'm realising now a huge lack of research! 'So amazing to see a lot more conversation around endometriosis. After over a year of test I've recently got the answer, which is quite severe endometriosis & adenomyosis. Revealing she is still finding her feet since the diagnosis, she said: 'Not fully ready to talk about it yet I'm just getting my head around it and processing it myself for now... 'But I didn't have the symptoms I associated with endo which was period pain and fertility issues so it was a huge shock to me but it has really affected me in other ways since I had Lilah.' A few days later, Lucy shared a picture of her stomach and revealed she had been struggling with bloating as one of the symptoms of the condition. She said: 'The joys of endometriosis and adenomyosis. I'm actually fed up of trying to cover the bloating I get 80 per cent of the time. 'This is actually mild bloating for me. I've tried every spanx, every supplement (even though I knew they prob wouldn't work) eating well and exercising does hugely help. But the anxiety of spring/summer approaching and wearing swimwear and summer clothes in general is really getting to me. 'I know there's so many worse things but it's so horrible having zero control of symptoms like bloating even with a healthy lifestyle.

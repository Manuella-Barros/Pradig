Police were alerted that he \u201cmay be under the influence\u201d while ordering at the fast food outlet in Partick at about 1am, reports the Sunday Mail. Officers found him sitting in the driver\u2019s seat with the engine running. Fiscal Louise James told Glasgow Sheriff Court: \u201cMaterne agreed to provide a specimen of breath. The officer asked if he had consumed any alcohol and when his last drink was. He replied: \u2018I have had a few\u2019.\u201d A later test revealed Materne had 78mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 22mg. Materne was charged, but claimed: \u201cI think this is unfair.\u201d He was ordered to appear in the dock at a later date. Court papers had his bail address as a flat in the city\u2019s Kelvinbridge. Materne pleaded guilty to drink driving and was fined \u00a3480 and disqualified from the road for 15 months.

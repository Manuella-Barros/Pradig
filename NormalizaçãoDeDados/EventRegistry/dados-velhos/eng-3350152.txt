Crowson said the display and the configuration of the store suggest the photo is legitimate. It was not clear whether the sign was placed by an employee or a shopper.\n\n\"What's seen in this photograph would never be acceptable in our stores. We regret this situation and are looking into how it could have happened,\" he said in a statement. He declined to comment on whether Walmart officials acknowledged the connection critics were making between guns and mass shootings on school campuses.\n\nCrowson also said early indications the sign was at a store in Evansville, Indiana, were incorrect.\n\nLeeanna May, who told The Post she took the photo, disputes that assertion.\n\nMay said she was in Evansville on an early morning shopping trip Wednesday with her husband when they walked by the sporting goods section, where May spotted the display she called \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"We have already lost so many innocent lives to guns,\" she said, adding that she drew an immediate connection between firearms and school shootings. May said she alerted store employees but could not find a manager.\n\n\"People don't seem to honestly care,\" she said.\n\nWalmart's Twitter account replied to dozens of angry comments about the photo. In what appears to be the first reply over the incident, the company's account tweeted May, whose account is now private, at 8:17 a.m. Wednesday morning to ask the location of the store.\n\n\"We appreciate you letting us know about this display. Which store location was this? -Vik\n\n-- Walmart (@Walmart) August 9, 2017\"\n\nAfter May said that the store was in Evansville, the company replied at 9:33 a.m. to say:\n\n\"I'm happy to tell you our store manager Christina has removed the sign from the display. Thanks again for alerting us to this. -Vik\n\n-- Walmart (@Walmart) August 9, 2017\"\n\nCrowson did not immediately return a request for comment on the disparity between the company's position and May's claim.\n\nThe display is another marketing-related mishap for the megachain.\n\nIn July, the company was blasted for using a racist term to describe a wig cap sold on its online store. The third-party item's color was listed as \"n---- brown.\"\n\nWalmart also drew fire ahead of Sept. 11 last year, when a Panama City Beach, Florida, store used Coca-Cola products to build an American flag display with two black towers, signifying the World Trade Center under a banner image of the New York skyline with a message \"WE WILL NEVER FORGET.\"\n\n17930304", "time": "07:34:00"}

Crowson said the display and the configuration of the store suggest the photo is legitimate. It was not clear whether the sign was placed there by an employee or a shopper.\n\n\"What's seen in this photograph would never be acceptable in our stores. We regret this situation and are looking into how it could have happened,\" he said in a statement. He declined to comment on whether Walmart officials acknowledged the connection critics were making between guns and mass shootings on school campuses.\n\nCrowson also said early indications the sign was at a store in Evansville, Indiana, were incorrect.\n\nLeeanna May, who told The Post she took the photo, disputes that assertion.\n\nMay said she was in Evansville on an early morning shopping trip Wednesday with her husband when they walked by the sporting goods section, where May spotted the display she called \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"We have already lost so many innocent lives to guns,\" she said, adding that she drew an immediate connection between firearms and school shootings. May said she alerted store employees but could not find a manager.\n\n\"People don't seem to honestly care,\" she said.\n\nWalmart's Twitter account replied to dozens of angry comments about the photo. In what appears to be the first reply over the incident, the company's account tweeted May, whose account is now private, at 8:17 a.m. Wednesdayo ask the location of the store.\n\n\"We appreciate you letting us know about this display. Which store location was this? -Vik\n\n-- Walmart (@Walmart) August 9, 2017\"\n\n\"I'm happy to tell you our store manager Christina has removed the sign from the display. Thanks again for alerting us to this. -Vik\n\n-- Walmart (@Walmart) August 9, 2017\"\n\nAfter May said that the store was in Evansville, the company replied at 9:33 a.m. to say: \"I'm happy to tell you our store manager Christina has removed the sign from the display. Thanks again for alerting us to this.\"\n\nCrowson did not immediately return a request for comment on the disparity between the company's position and May's claim.\n\nThe display is another marketing-related mishap for the megachain. In July, the company was blasted for using a racist term to describe a wig cap sold on its online store. The third party item's color was listed as \"n -- brown.\"\n\nWalmart also drew fire ahead of Sept. 11 last year, when a Panama City Beach, Florida, store used Coca-Cola products to build an American flag display with two black towers, signifying the World Trade Center under a banner image of the New York skyline with a message \"WE WILL NEVER FORGET.\"", "time": "14:13:00"}

Crowson said the display and the configuration of the store suggest the photo is legitimate. It was not clear whether the sign was placed there by an employee or a shopper.\n\n\"What's seen in this photograph would never be acceptable in our stores. We regret this situation and are looking into how it could have happened,\" he said. He declined to comment on whether Walmart officials acknowledged the connection critics were making between guns and mass shootings on school campuses.\n\nCrowson also said early indications the sign was at a store in Evansville, Ind., were incorrect.\n\nLeeanna May, who told the Post she took the photo, disputes that assertion.\n\nMay said she was in Evansville on an early morning shopping trip Wednesday with her husband when they walked by the sporting goods section, where May spotted the display she called \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"We have already lost so many innocent lives to guns,\" she said, adding that she drew an immediate connection between firearms and school shootings. May said she alerted store employees but could not find a manager.\n\n\"People don't seem to honestly care,\" she said.\n\nWalmart's Twitter account replied to dozens of angry comments about the photo. In what appears to be the first reply over the incident, the company's account tweeted May, whose account is now private, at 8:17 a.m. Wednesday to ask the location of the store.\n\nAfter May said that the store was in Evansville, the company replied at 9:33 a.m. to say: \"I'm happy to tell you our store manager Christina has removed the sign from the display. Thanks again for alerting us to this.\"\n\nCrowson did not return a request for comment on the disparity between the company's position and May's claim.\n\nThe display is another marketing-related mishap for the megachain. In July, the company was blasted for using a racist term to describe a wig cap sold on its online store. The third party item's color was listed as \"n -- brown.\"\n\nWalmart also drew fire ahead of Sept. 11 last year, when a Panama City Beach, Fla., store used Coca-Cola products to build a U.S. flag display with two black towers, signifying the World Trade Center under a banner image of the New York skyline with a message \"WE WILL NEVER FORGET.\"", "time": "14:42:00"}

Crowson said the display and the configuration of the store suggest the photo is legitimate. It was not clear whether the sign was placed there by an employee or a shopper.\n\n\"What's seen in this photograph would never be acceptable in our stores. We regret this situation and are looking into how it could have happened,\" he said in a statement. He declined to comment on whether Walmart officials acknowledged the connection critics were making between guns and mass shootings on school campuses.\n\nCrowson also said early indications the sign was at a store in Evansville, Indiana, were incorrect.\n\nLeeanna May, who told The Post she took the photo, disputes that assertion.\n\nMay said she was in Evansville on an early morning shopping trip Wednesday with her husband when they walked by the sporting goods section, where May spotted the display she called \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"We have already lost so many innocent lives to guns,\" she said, adding that she drew an immediate connection between firearms and school shootings. May said she alerted store employees but could not find a manager.\n\n\"People don't seem to honestly care,\" she said.\n\nWalmart's Twitter account replied to dozens of angry comments about the photo. In what appears to be the first reply over the incident, the company's account tweeted May, whose account is now private, at 8:17 am Wednesday morning to ask the location of the store.\n\n\"We appreciate you letting us know about this display. Which store location was this? -Vik\n\n- Walmart (@Walmart) August 9, 2017\"\n\n\"I'm happy to tell you our store manager Christina has removed the sign from the display. Thanks again for alerting us to this. -Vik\n\n- Walmart (@Walmart) August 9, 2017\"\n\nAfter May said that the store was in Evansville, the company replied at 9:33 am to say: \"I'm happy to tell you our store manager Christina has removed the sign from the display. Thanks again for alerting us to this.\"\n\nCrowson did not immediately return a request for comment on the disparity between the company's position and May's claim.\n\nThe display is another marketing-related mishap for the megachain. In July, the company was blasted for using a racist term to describe a wig cap sold on its online store. The third party item's color was listed as \"n- brown.\"\n\nWalmart also drew fire ahead of Sept. 11 last year, when a Panama City Beach, Florida, store used Coca-Cola products to build an American flag display with two black towers, signifying the World Trade Center under a banner image of the New York skyline with a message \"WE WILL NEVER FORGET.\"", "time": "05:38:00"}

I hope this helps, Jared and we want you to know we are truly sorry for this. -Vik\n\n-- Walmart (@Walmart) August 9, 2017\n\nWhen you Google, \"walmart store 1341,\" the west side location is what pops up.\n\nAfter discussing this on the air this morning, we had a couple of callers say based on other evidence in the photo including what appears to be a low ceiling, this photo was not taken at the west side location. One caller went as far to say he was at that location recently in the sporting goods department and the only gun display was against the back wall, behind a counter.\n\nCNN spoke to Walmart representative, Charles Crowson, about the photo and the location of the display, to which Crowson responded was listed incorrectly. He went on to say the company was still investigating the photo and the exact location where it was taken.\n\nIf you need further proof, Brett Allega, producer for WEHT-WTVW Eyewitness News tweeted this morning he has confirmed with Walmart the photo was NOT taken at the west side location.\n\nRegardless of whether or not this is our Walmart, I think everyone needs to take a breath before jumping to conclusions. There could be multiple stories behind this photo regardless of whether or not it was taken here in Evansville. This easily could have been a rogue employee trying to make a joke which clearly wasn't funny, or a random customer who also took it upon themselves to try and make a joke or statement of some kind, or it could have been staged by the person who took the photo seeking their 15 minutes of fame (which clearly worked, for what that's worth). Whatever the case, it's my personal opinion this was done in extremely poor taste, and whoever is responsible should be punished in some way, shape, or form.", "time": "13:38:00"}

The image quickly drew criticism on social media, with some people expressing outrage and citing school shootings.\n\nAfter word of the photograph spread, Walmart apologized and said over Twitter than the sign had been removed.\n\nBut Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson told CBS News on Thursday that a company investigation, including a review of surveillance footage, found that the photo was not taken at the store. The retail giant also concluded the sign did not appear at its only other Evansville store that sells firearms.\n\n\"We have looked at videos and photographs of the sporting department, and there was no indication of the sign being there,\" Crowson said.\n\n\"The Evansville store doesn't even have those gun displays,\" he said, adding that such a display \"would never be acceptable\" in the company's stores.\n\nCrowson said Walmart is still trying to determine the origin of the photo. While not ruling out that an employee may have posted the sign, he said it could have been a customer prank or the photograph may have been digitally manipulated.\n\nWalmart has previously attracted unwanted attention for its store displays.

Crowson said the display and the configuration of the store suggest the photo is legitimate. It was not clear whether the sign was placed there by an employee or a shopper.\n\n\"What's seen in this photograph would never be acceptable in our stores. We regret this situation and are looking into how it could have happened,\" he said in a statement. He declined to comment on whether Walmart officials acknowledged the connection critics were making between guns and mass shootings on school campuses.\n\nCrowson also said early indications the sign was at a store in Evansville, Indiana, were incorrect.\n\nLeeanna May, who told The Post she took the photo, disputes that assertion.\n\nMay said she was in Evansville on an early morning shopping trip Wednesday with her husband when they walked by the sporting goods section, where May spotted the display she called \"disgusting.\"\n\n\"We have already lost so many innocent lives to guns,\" she said, adding that she drew an immediate connection between firearms and school shootings. May said she alerted store employees but could not find a manager.\n\n\"People don't seem to honestly care,\" she said.\n\nWalmart's Twitter account replied to dozens of angry comments about the photo. In what appears to be the first reply over the incident, the company's account tweeted May, whose account is now private, at 8:17 am Wednesday morning to ask the location of the store.\n\nAfter May said that the store was in Evansville, the company replied at 9:33 am to say: \"I'm happy to tell you our store manager Christina has removed the sign from the display. Thanks again for alerting us to this.\"\n\nCrowson did not immediately return a request for comment on the disparity between the company's position and May's claim.\n\nThe display is another marketing-related mishap for the megachain. In July, the company was blasted for using a racist term to describe a wig cap sold on its online store. The third party item's color was listed as \"n- brown.\"\n\nWalmart also drew fire ahead of Sept. 11 last year, when a Panama City Beach, Florida, store used Coca-Cola products to build an American flag display with two black towers, signifying the World Trade Center under a banner image of the New York skyline with a message \"WE WILL NEVER FORGET.\"", "time": "07:11:00"}

And while it's not sure why this was the case, or if the image was merely Photoshopped by a third-party source, the company issued an apology for the photos, also promising to investigate further into the situation.\n\nAs reported by CNBC, the outrage started on Wednesday, as a photo of a back-to-school banner with the caption \"Own the school year like a hero\" above a glass case full of rifles went viral on social media. Twitter and Reddit users took to the internet to complain about how Walmart's back-to-school campaign appeared to include guns for sale, and as the photo continued to circulate online, reports were suggesting that the Walmart store that put up the controversial sign was in Evansville, Indiana.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, Evansville woman Leeanna May insisted on the legitimacy of the Walmart back-to-school gun photo, telling the publication that she and her husband saw the \"disgusting\" display while at their local Walmart branch on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"We have already lost so many innocent lives to guns,\" May told the Post, adding that she had tried informing store officials, but couldn't get a manager to assist her.\n\nWith the internet in an uproar over what looked to be a callous endorsement of guns for young people amid continued concern over school shootings, Walmart issued a prepared statement Thursday, apologizing for the photo, and noting that officials are investigating into the situation and the circumstances behind it.\n\n\"What's seen in this photograph would never be acceptable in our stores. We regret this situation and are looking into how it could have happened,\" read Walmart's statement, as quoted by the HuffPost.\n\nSpeaking to the HuffPost, Walmart spokesman Charles Crowson commented on the back-to-school gun photo, saying that the company is \"actively trying\" to identify the exact store where the sign was put up. He also debunked Leeanna May's earlier statements, saying that the store was definitely not in Evansville, Indiana, based on the photos and videos from the store in question.\n\nAdditionally, Crowson said that Walmart is looking into the possibility of the photo being a prank, or if someone had used Photoshop to make it appear as if the retailer was encouraging schoolchildren to use guns.\n\nThe Washington Post noted that Walmart's alleged back-to-school gun photo is not the first time in recent months that the company has dealt with potential press relations nightmares over careless marketing. Last month, the retailer drew criticism for selling a third-party wig cap sold in the color \"n****r brown.\" A Panama City Beach, Florida Walmart had also made the news last year, for using Coca-Cola products to recreate the World Trade Center tragedy, and using a banner that read \"9-11-01: WE WILL NEVER FORGET,\" with the New York skyline in the background.", "time": "08:48:00"}

The user originally captioned the photo, which shows a case of rifles with a sign reading \"Own the school year like a hero,\" simply, \"Oh, Walmart.\"\n\nA response from a Walmart representative on Twitter identified the store where the display allegedly took place as Store No. 1,341, which is located in Evansville, Indiana. However, a Walmart spokesperson told CNN Money that the earlier indications that the company knew where the sign was located were false and that Walmart was still working to identify the store and remove the sign.\n\n\"We incorrectly identified the Evansville store,\" the spokesperson also told Talking Points Memo. \"We've corrected that and are now trying to find the accurate store.\"\n\nContradicting previous tweets, the spokesperson also told both outlets that the company has ensured the sign was taken down.\n\nSince then, the company has replied to angry customers and commenters on social media, calling the sign unacceptable and referring to it as a \"regrettable situation.\"\n\nWalmart has fiercely resisted calls by some activists to stop selling guns in its stores. While the company decided in 1993 to stop selling handguns, it has continued to sell rifles for sport and hunting, according to CNN. According to a 2013 article from Time, Walmart sells guns in 1,700 to 1,800 of its 4,000 stores in the U.S. and is likely the single biggest firearms seller in the country. Previously, the company had cut back on the number of locations where guns are available, before reversing that decision in 2011, per the Wall Street Journal.\n\nPushes for Walmart to drop its gun sales have often coincided with mass shootings, especially after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, and critics were quick to draw a connection Wednesday with the display's back-to-school theme.", "time": "00:07:00"}

The sign stated \"Own the school year like a hero\" and it was placed directly above a gun case containing numerous rifles for sale to the general public. Activists and concerned Twitter users blew a fuse faster than you can say \"lower prices,\" and didn't hesitate to state their opinion and direct questions to Walmart's account.\n\nThe caption of the photo is \"Oh @Walmart\" and includes an emoji relevant to the wording and promotes a \"oh goodness\" thought upon seeing the sign.\n\nAs per the Sacramento Bee, the sign was falsely reported to be located in store No. 1,341 of Evansville, Indiana. However, Ismail Kidd Noorzai's Twitter account identifies him as a resident of Los Angeles. In a moderately contradictory way, Walmart has admitted it is looking into how it happened, and said it would never approve of such sign placement. The sign was likely the result of a prankster and not endorsed by Walmart.\n\nWalmart has called the sign placement a \"regrettable situation\" in replies to irritated customers, but that has not changed its stance on the continuance of rifle sales.\n\n\"Walmart sells guns in 1,700 to 1,800 of its 4,000 stores in the U.S. and is likely the single biggest firearms seller in the country. Previously, the company had cut back on the number of locations where guns are available, before reversing that decision in 2011,\" per the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe \"regrettable situation\" has reignited the gun sales controversy in which activists clamored for Walmart to cease gun sales. Activists and angry customers often cite references to school shootings and various violent crimes in hopes that Walmart will no longer sell guns. This activism dates back to the early 90s where Walmart responded, in 1993, by ceasing to sell handguns. The retail giant continues to sell rifles. The rifles are often used for hunting or shooting sports such as the events in the ISSF shooting category. There's also at least three events in the Olympics that judge a shooter's ability to accurately fire upon targets from various distances.\n\nWalmart is reported to be one of the largest gun retailers in the country.", "time": "18:03:00"}

But because this is America, on Wednesday afternoon a Twitter user posted a picture of just that: A Walmart back-to school display of firearms.\n\nThe picture was tweeted by a customer and depicted a display of firearms with a reading, \"Own The School Year Like A Hero\" right on top of it, implying that guns are as essential academic success as freshly sharpened pencils. Walmart apologized for the sign advertising guns as back-to-school items on Twitter and in a statement to Romper, but the whole ordeal has many people, including Walmart executives, scratching their heads.\n\nWalmart's Senior Manager of Corporate Communications, Charles Crowson, told Romper in a statement:\n\nCrowson also told Romper that Walmart has not actually located the store in question just yet, which was originally thought to be in Evansville, Indiana, due to Walmart's response to the initial tweet. \"There was a miscommunication between the corporate and social media teams [on Wednesday afternoon] that has now been resolved. I can confirm that we are actively trying to find the store where this happened,\" Crowson told Romper.\n\nNeedless to say, people were shocked and outraged:\n\nWalmart's apology and effort to resolve the situation is well-taken, but it doesn't totally address the underlying issue behind the interest in the viral photo. The fact is, most Americans believe that access to guns should be more regulated and should not be joked about, according to the Pew Research Center. While others, given the Walmart display, might feel that guns are a laughing matter or that bringing a gun to school makes one a \"hero.\"\n\nPart of Walmart's enthusiastic response to the viral tweet on Wednesday, and likely the reason the image went viral in the first place, is that it's not so hard to imagine a world in which some people think more guns in schools are the answer to increasing gun violence and mass shootings in the U.S. Betsy DeVos, Secretary of the Department of Education, said as much when questioned about her stance on guns in schools earlier this year during her confirmation hearings.\n\nGun control advocates have long targeted Walmart for selling firearms in certain stores and perpetuating \"easy access\" to firearms. For what it's worth, Walmart only sells guns in-store (not online) in certain markets and in accordance with each state's regulations. It does not sell handguns or high-capacity magazines. The company also videotapes all sales of firearms.\n\nAccording to CNN, the company maintains that its sporting goods departments are vital to its business, which means that even if the company has removed certain types of assault rifles from its inventory, which it did in 2015, some types of guns will likely be a mainstay at the superstore in many markets.\n\nBut video tapes and business interests don't mean anything to the victims of the 196 school shootings since 2013, 64 of them in 2015 alone. Or any of the other mass shootings Americans have endured, like at the Pulse nightclub in Florida in 2016 or the Aurora, Colorado mass shooting in 2012. Despite anyone's stance on gun control, one thing is pretty clear: America has a problem when it comes to guns, even if all of them aren't bought at Walmart.\n\nIt is likely that the signage in the picture from Wednesday taken at a Walmart was a prank or a simple mistake made by an underpaid employee. But school shootings are nothing to laugh about and, despite the kinds of guns it sells and its protocol regarding transactions, Walmart could do a lot of good by taking a stance in the discussion surrounding gun control reform, instead of just cleaning up the aftermath of bad social media mentions.\n\nParents have enough problems while back-to-school shopping with their kids in tow. Being reminded that one of their kids might not come home one day on the bus shouldn't be one of them.", "time": "00:04:00"}

One person recalled:\n\nOne time I told a new employee in the backroom \"hey, go put this out on floor for me\" meaning \"put this out on the sales floor on the right shelf\". A few minutes later, there the item was sitting literally on the floor just outside the stockroom. This was basically my reaction when I realized what I had said to him.\n\nThe phrase \"own the school year like a hero\" is associated with a back-to-school advertising campaign selling superhero clothing and does not have any association with firearms sales. It is unclear whether the sign was placed near the display by mistake, or if the angle of the photograph makes it appear to be closer to the gun display than it was in reality.\n\nWe reached out to Walmart to clarify what had happened, but have not yet received a response.", "time": "03:16:00"}

Many Twitter users then started asking the retail giant for an explanation. Responding to the tweets, the retail giant apologized and informed the sign was removed.\n\nIn one of its tweets, Walmart said the sign was found in the store number-1341, however, it did not confirm the location of the store. A report claimed the store was in Evansville, Indiana.\n\nHowever, in another Tweet, the retail giant said the company confirmed with the shop manager, who said there was no such sign near the guns.\n\nOh @Walmart \u1f926\u1f3fc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/SLdROB4KYF -- Ismail Kidd Noorzai (@ismailkidd)\n\nAugust 9, 2017\n\nTwitter users alleged such a behavior was adding fuel to the already existing problem of gun violence in the United States.\n\nTRENDING: Man Sues American Airlines After 14-Hour Flight Next To Obese Passengers\n\nUnder the \"Back to School\" banner, Walmart sells products like backpacks, lunchboxes, binders, glue sticks, crayons and other such essentials. In an advertisement with the tagline \"Own the school like a hero,\" the retail giant promotes products linked with superheroes.\n\nAnd this is not the first time that Walmart has landed in such a controversy. In July, Walmart apologized after facing criticism online for using a racial slur in a product listing on its website. The company claimed the product was listed by a third party seller, and also mentioned it was upset with the use of such a word on its website and it had removed the unidentified seller completely from its site.\n\n\"We are very sorry and appalled that this third party seller listed their item with this description on our online marketplace,\" Danit Marquardt, Director, Corporate Communications & Media Relations, Walmart, said. \"It is a clear violation of our policy, and has been removed, and we are investigating the seller to determine how this could have happened.\"\n\nIn September, a Walmart store in Panama City Beach stacked up Coca-cola bottles to make them look like World Trade Center, with a message that read: \" We will never forget.\" While the gesture aimed at commemorating the 9/11 attacks, social media users criticized the company for using the opportunity for branding.\n\nIn October 2014, the store apologized for labeling a cloth category for adult plus size Halloween outfits, \"Fat Girl Costumes.\" After facing social media backlash, the firm's spokesperson came out with a statement saying, \"This should never have been on our site. It is unacceptable, and we apologize. We are working to remove it as soon as possible and ensure this never happens again,\" according to reports.\n\nREAD: Neanderthal DNA Reveals Human Evolution Timeline Through Genetic Mutations\n\nIn 2015, Walmart, along with other retailers like Amazon and eBay, banned the sale of Confederate flag merchandise. The step was taken after the flag became a sore point in the aftermath of a shooting at a historic African-American church in Charleston.\n\nSeveral other retailers have apologized in the past and removed controversial products from their shops and websites.

The retail giant meant it to be a tribute to 9/11 victims ahead of the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attack, however, it backfired and was criticized by everyone.\n\nLast month, Walmart issued an apology after a third-party vendor on its website used a racial slur to describe a product.

In the picture, a sign with the tagline, \"Own the school year like a hero,\" was seen displayed above a gun rack. It appeared the guns were being marketed as \"Back to School\" items.\n\nTRENDING: Man Sues American Airlines After 14-Hour Flight Next To Obese Passengers\n\nA Twitter user, Ismail Kidd Noorazi, first posted the picture that sparked the outrage. Many Twitter users then started asking the retail giant for an explanation. Responding to the tweets, Walmart apologized and informed the sign has been removed.\n\nIn one of its tweets, Walmart said the sign was found at the store number-1341, however, it did not confirm the location of the store. A report claimed the store was in Evansville, Indiana.\n\nBut in another Tweet, the retailer said the store manager confirmed there was no such sign placed above the gun rack.\n\nA Twitter user said such actions would promote violence in schools.\n\nUnder the \"Back to School\" banner, Walmart sells products like backpacks, lunchboxes, binders, glue sticks, crayons and other such essentials. In an advertisement with the tagline \"Own the school like a hero,\" the retail giant promotes products meant for school kids linked with superheroes.\n\nThis is not the first time that the retail giant has landed in such a controversy. In July, Walmart apologized after facing criticism online for using a racial slur in a product listing on its website. The company claimed the product was listed by a third party seller, and also mentioned it was upset with the use of such a word on its website and it had removed the unidentified seller completely from its site.\n\n\"We are very sorry and appalled that this third party seller listed their item with this description on our online marketplace,\" Danit Marquardt, Director, Corporate Communications & Media Relations, Walmart, said. \"It is a clear violation of our policy, and has been removed, and we are investigating the seller to determine how this could have happened.\"\n\nIn September, a Walmart store in Panama City Beach stacked up Coca-cola bottles to make them look like the World Trade Center, with a message that read: \"We will never forget.\" While the gesture aimed at commemorating the 9/11 attacks, social media users criticized the company for using the opportunity for branding.\n\nIn October 2014, the store apologized for labeling a cloth category, \"Fat Girl Costumes.\" After facing social media backlash, the firm's spokesperson issued a statement saying, \"This should never have been on our site. It is unacceptable, and we apologize. We are working to remove it as soon as possible and ensure this never happens again,\" according to reports.\n\nREAD: Neanderthal DNA Reveals Human Evolution Timeline Through Genetic Mutations\n\nIn 2015, Walmart, along with other retailers like Amazon and eBay, banned the sale of Confederate flag merchandise. The step was taken after the flag became a sore point in the aftermath of a shooting at a historic African-American church in Charleston.\n\nSeveral other retailers have apologized in the past and removed controversial products from their shops and websites. While Amazon had to remove a doormat with the picture of the Indian flag, Nike offered an explanation for using an offensive name for a range of sports shoes. The retailer selling athletic footwear, apparel and accessories had named the range of shoes, \"Zenji.\" Many social media users said it was a derogatory term in Arabic for people from Zanzibar.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWalmart Stores Turn Haven For Sex Offenders?Walmart To Create 1.5 Million Manufacturing Jobs", "time": "15:16:00"}

A company spokesperson is now apologizing for the snap, and the company is working on figuring out exactly who set it up.\n\nIn a statement reported by The Washington Post, Walmart spokesperson Charles Crowson said that it wasn't clear whether the display had been set up by a company employee or a shopper. He also said that the reported store location of Evansville, Indiana, was incorrect.\n\n\"What's seen in this photograph would never be acceptable in our stores,\" said Crowson. We regret this situation and are looking into how it could have happened.\"\n\nLeeanna May, the Twitter user who posted the original photograph of the gun display, told the Post that she tried and failed to find a store manager while shopping, and that she is dismayed that no one would have considered the connection between back-to-school displays and school shootings.\n\nThroughout the day yesterday, Walmart's social media team responded quickly to dozens of comments about the lack of foresight in promoting guns using the company's back-to-school superhero campaign. One tweet from the company assured disgruntled tweeters that a store manager, \"Christina,\" had been located and the display was removed (which goes against Crowson's statement that it could not have been a store in Indiana).\n\nWhile there have been no further comments on the display from the company, many people, like May, were disappointed in the lack of understanding of how gun violence affects students. Since 2013, there have been over 200 school shootings in the US, an average of one per week, including summer months.", "time": "17:38:00"}

He acknowledged only that the photo wasn't taken at a store in Evansville, Indiana, as had been originally suggested. He wouldn't say where the image had been made -- only that the mystery had been solved. \"This is a result of a collective effort by a number of associates who take things like this seriously,\" he said.

In the picture, a sign with the tagline, \"Own the school year like a hero,\" was seen displayed above a gun rack. It appeared the guns were being marketed as \"Back to School\" items.\n\nTRENDING: Man Sues American Airlines After 14-Hour Flight Next To Obese Passengers\n\nA twitter user, Ismail Kidd Noorazi, first posted the picture that sparked outrage. Many Twitter users then started asking the retail giant for an explanation. Responding to the tweets, the retail giant apologized and informed the sign was removed.\n\nIn one of its tweets, Walmart said the sign was found in the store number-1341, however, it did not confirm the location of the store. A report claimed the store was in Evansville, Indiana.\n\nHowever, in another Tweet, the retail giant said the company confirmed with the shop manager, who said there was no such sign near the guns.\n\nTwitter users alleged such a behavior was adding fuel to the already existing problem of gun violence in the United States.\n\nUnder the \"Back to School\" banner, Walmart sells products like backpacks, lunchboxes, binders, glue sticks, crayons and other such essentials. In an advertisement with the tagline \"Own the school like a hero,\" the retail giant promotes products linked with superheroes.\n\nAnd this is not the first time that Walmart has landed in such a controversy. In July, Walmart apologized after facing criticism online for using a racial slur in a product listing on its website. The company claimed the product was listed by a third party seller, and also mentioned it was upset with the use of such a word on its website and it had removed the unidentified seller completely from its site.\n\n\"We are very sorry and appalled that this third party seller listed their item with this description on our online marketplace,\" Danit Marquardt, Director, Corporate Communications & Media Relations, Walmart, said. \"It is a clear violation of our policy, and has been removed, and we are investigating the seller to determine how this could have happened.\"\n\nIn September, a Walmart store in Panama City Beach stacked up Coca-cola bottles to make them look like World Trade Center, with a message that read: \" We will never forget.\" While the gesture aimed at commemorating the 9/11 attacks, social media users criticized the company for using the opportunity for branding.\n\nIn October 2014, the store apologized for labeling a cloth category for adult plus size Halloween outfits, \"Fat Girl Costumes.\" After facing social media backlash, the firm's spokesperson came out with a statement saying, \"This should never have been on our site. It is unacceptable, and we apologize. We are working to remove it as soon as possible and ensure this never happens again,\" according to reports.\n\nREAD: Neanderthal DNA Reveals Human Evolution Timeline Through Genetic Mutations\n\nIn 2015, Walmart, along with other retailers like Amazon and eBay, banned the sale of Confederate flag merchandise. The step was taken after the flag became a sore point in the aftermath of a shooting at a historic African-American church in Charleston.\n\nSeveral other retailers have apologized in the past and removed controversial products from their shops and websites. While Amazon had to remove a doormat with the picture of Indian flag, Nike offered an explanation for using an offensive name for its range of sneakers. The retailer selling athletic footwear, apparel and accessories had named the range of shoes \"Zenji.\" Many social media users said it was a derogatory term in Arabic for people from Zanzibar.", "time": "06:52:00"}

It's above a rack of guns,\" said Chris Knox of Hanover.\n\nThat's right - above a hunting rifle display case at an unidentified Walmart, according to store officials.\n\n\"What do I think? I personally think it's harmless,\" added Knox.\n\n\"I think people make too much of a lot of things. Just overreact,\" said Terry Jacobson, who lives in Arkansas but visits Hanover.\n\n\"I think it sends a message you're supposed to take a gun to school. Why would you put that over a stack of guns?\" said Laurie Kuhn of Hanover.\n\nSome people we spoke with in Hanover say the sign could've been an innocent mistake - others want to know how it got there and worry about the message it could send children.\n\nWalmart says the sign has been taken down, but it's still prompting a serious discussion about guns and firearm rights.\n\n\"I mean with the school shootings and all that I can see that being an issue, but I mean your second amendment rights about being able to own guns,\" stated Knox.\n\n\"I think for people that are still learning what's right and what's wrong. To them, that's saying take a gun to school,\" said Kuhn.\n\nJacobson says the sign is something she could see in a Walmart back home.\n\n\"Where I live, a lot of people have guns, it's not a problem. They teach their kids to shoot guns,\" she said.\n\nWalmart apologized for the sign on twitter, calling it, \"a regrettable situation\" and says, \"it would never be acceptable in any of our stores.\" Kuhn just wants to know how it got there.\n\n\"I believe management of the store should be held responsible for something like that because the managers run the store. They should be going around the store and checking things. That should not have been there,\" she added.\n\nWalmart has not said which store location was involved in the incident and that they are still investigating.\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The image showed a glass case of unidentified long guns. Above the case, a sign boasted, \"Own the school year like a hero.\"\n\nThe phrase is associated with a back-to-school advertising campaign for children, which features comic book crime-busting heroes like Superman and Wonder Woman, and has no link to firearm sales.\n\nIt is probable the sign placement above the gun rack was a mistake. Some online users are also claiming it may be caused by a prankster customer.\n\nHowever, people who viewed the picture found it in very bad taste, given the United States' history of mass shootings at schools, such as Sandy Hook and Columbine.\n\nSoon after the image went viral, people took to Twitter to lambast Wal-Mart for the offensive and highly inappropriate sign.\n\nThe store chain was quick to reply, stating the sign placement was a big mistake. It is now attempting to control the damage and is doing its best to respond to each and every person who has posted the photo online and is demanding explanation.\n\nTo clarify, we spoke with the manager at the location reported to us and they confirmed there was no such sign. Looking into this -Dean -- Walmart (@Walmart)\n\nAugust 9, 2017\n\nWal-Mart said one of their managers \"confirmed there was no such sign\" at the location where it was allegedly seen. Spokesman Charles Crowson told the New York Daily News the reported location of the sign was a result of miscommunication. The retail giant is now attempting to track down where the incident actually occurred -- not an easy task, since Wal-Mart has 4,000 supermarkets across the United States.\n\n\"walmart accidentally puts back to school sign up on firearms\" if this was a political cartoon we'd be like \"that's a little heavy handed\" -- gremory \u1f98e mosity (@nefaeryous)\n\nAugust 10, 2017\n\nI want to say I enjoy shopping at Wal-Mart.Hate the long lines.That sign over the guns that department all should be FIRED....@Walmart -- Lisa Brown (@LisaBro51437923)\n\nAugust 10, 2017\n\nThis is troubling?

Initially, the company apologized and said the sign was being taken down but then began to question whether it had been there at all.\n\nCrowson wouldn't say what proof the company had: Was an image manipulated? Did a customer move a sign for a joke? Did an employee deliberately or inadvertently place the \"Own the School Year\" sign on the wrong display?\n\nHe acknowledged only that the photo wasn't taken at a store in Evansville, Indiana, as had been originally suggested. He wouldn't say where the image had been made -- only that the mystery had been solved.\n\n\"This is a result of a collective effort by a number of associates who take things like this seriously,\" he said.\n\nAfter the post appeared this week, a number of people criticized the company on social media, expressing disgust. Among the samples: \"Lemme just scoop my jaw off the floor\" and \"I've seen a lot of disturbing pictures of folks shopping at WalMart, but this tops them all.\"\n\nThe company has at times been pressured by shareholders about its gun sales.

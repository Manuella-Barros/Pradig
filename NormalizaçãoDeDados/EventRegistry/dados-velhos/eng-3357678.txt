false, "body": "Joe Hart was sporting an impressive black eye as he sat down to speak about his return to England with West Ham United.\n\n\"My induction was to have a fight with Andy [Carroll],\" said goalkeeper Hart. \"No, I spread for the ball on Tuesday. I get hit in the face quite a lot, but this is the first time it has actually marked me. Andy hasn't come off worse than me, no.\"\n\nJoking aside, it has been a bruising 12 months for Hart, who was immediately discarded by Pep Guardiola, the Manchester City manager, and spent last season on loan in Italy at Torino.\n\nWith few Premier League clubs changing goalkeepers, Hart had to revise his preference to find a new permanent home this summer and accept another season-long loan move - this time at West Ham.\n\n\"The permanent was going to be difficult,\" said Hart, who will make his West Ham debut against Manchester United today. \"I don't think there were too many options for me to go on a permanent, if any. That was my ideal situation.\n\n\"When you've asked me questions I've always answered honestly and, ideally, I wanted to be signing a permanent deal somewhere, so I could set my life up and have a direction.\n\n\"But that wasn't meant to be and West Ham have been absolutely fantastic towards me, I can't be any more grateful for the opportunity they have given me. Slaven [Bilic] has come and [owners] Mr [David] Gold and Mr [David] Sullivan have come in and made their intentions clear that they want me to be here, and I'm over the moon to be a part of this club.\n\n\"There wasn't an awful lot of movement goalkeeper-wise this summer, so I'm very grateful to get this opportunity.\"\n\nWest Ham has been a good rehabilitation centre for English goalkeepers with a point to prove over the past few years. David James and Robert Green both resurrected their careers in London's East End, and Hart is looking to do the same.\n\n\"I know Rob and Jamo well,\" he said. \"Jamo actually said I'd love it here when I spoke to him. I want to add to that and be an England goalkeeper playing for West Ham, I really do, and that's my intention.\n\n\"But first and foremost I want to perform well for the club and see where that takes me.\n\n\"I reach out to a few people when I have decisions to make, I'm really lucky to have some sound advice from inside football and outside football, a lot of people I respect, and Jamo is certainly one of them. Everyone just said, 'It seems like a great opportunity and you need to grasp it'.\"\n\nEvery Claudio Bravo mistake at Manchester City last season met with claims that Guardiola should never have dumped Hart and the 30-year-old is sure to be compared with City's latest new goalkeeper, Ederson Moraes, this term.\n\nBut Hart insists there are only two managers he is out to impress and Guardiola is not one of them.\n\n\"I'm trying to make a point to Slaven Bilic, he's my coach,\" said Hart. \"I'm trying to make my point to Gareth Southgate, they're my coaches, they're the people whose opinions I care about.\"\n\nAsked about the difficulties City have experienced trying to replace him, Hart added: \"That's their problem. I need to look after myself, I need to be selfish in this situation.\n\n\"My feelings for Manchester City will never change, I'm eternally grateful to them as a football club. They took me as a 19-year-old boy from Shrewsbury Town, took something of a punt on me and I've had some fantastic times there and built some really great relationships. The fans have been so supportive of me, even in the last year, and that's something that will never die with me.\n\n\"I will eternally have a link with them, but as far as the business side of it goes and new managers and new opinions, that's football, I just have to take it on the chin. There's no point me taking it too personally because it's not all about me.\n\n\"The game moves quickly, there are plenty of people who have been in my situation and you have two choices. You can either moan about it and you can make smart comments and try to work out why it was done, or you can just get on with it. I've taken the latter.\"\n\nHart revealed that his move to West Ham has received the backing of Southgate, the England manager, and that he is ready for a tough battle to keep his place in the national team ahead of next summer's World Cup.\n\n\"I've always said the standard of keepers in England is very high,\" said Hart. \"It's a privileged position to play for the country. Every single time I've put on that No\u20091 jersey I have been very proud and very excited for what comes with it.\n\n\"You've got Jack Butland and Jordan Pickford now at Everon. Big Fraser Forster has signed a new deal at Southampton and Tom Heaton has been nothing short of a miracle for Burnley with his performances.\n\n\"There are plenty of other English keepers in the Championship.

Others have them dance or make a speech on their first day.\n\nSo when Joe Hart turned up to meet the media sporting a shiner, the England No 1 felt the need to explain why. 'My induction was to have a fight with Andy Carroll,' joked the West Ham keeper. 'Andy hasn't come off worse than me.\n\n'Nah, yesterday I spread for the ball. I get hit in the face quite a lot but this is the first time it has actually marked me.'\n\nJoe Hart wants to reestablish himself among the Premier League elite goalkeepers\n\nA bruised eye but no bruised ego, says Hart, who is at West Ham because Pep Guardiola decided he didn't want him at Manchester City. He insists he has no hard feelings, because he does not care about Guardiola's opinion. As of now, he only cares about Slaven Bilic's and Gareth Southgate's.\n\n'I'm trying to make a point to Slaven,' said Hart, who faces Manchester United today. 'He's my coach. I'm trying to make my point to Gareth Southgate. They're my coaches. They're the people whose opinions I care about.\n\n'Ideally I wanted to be signing a permanent deal somewhere so I could set my life up and have a direction. But that wasn't meant to be and West Ham have been absolutely fantastic towards me.\n\nHart is extremely thankful the Hammers have given him an opportunity this season\n\n'I cannot be any more grateful for the opportunity they have given me. Slaven has come and Mr (David) Gold and Mr (David) Sullivan have come in and made their intentions clear that they want me to be here. There wasn't an awful lot of movement goalkeeper-wise this summer so I'm very grateful to get this opportunity.'\n\nBut if he is going to be England's first-choice keeper in Russia next summer, he has plenty of competition, with World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia coming up next month. Burnley's Tom Heaton, Everton's Jordan Pickford and Stoke City's Jack Butland are breathing down his neck.\n\nHart spoke to Southgate before joining West Ham and they agreed that it would be best if he played in the Premier League this season.\n\n'I kept him updated with my situation,' Hart said. 'Gareth thinks West Ham is the right place for me to be. I want to play at the highest standard available to me. This definitely fits this criteria.\n\n'I've always said the standard of keepers in England is very high. Big Fras [Fraser Forster] has signed a new deal at Southampton. Heaton has been nothing short of a miracle for Burnley with his performances.\n\nHart is hoping his performances this season help him keep hold of his England place\n\nThe stopper holds no ill will to Manchester City despite losing favour at the club\n\n'It is tough to get into a Premier League team, I found that out myself this summer.'\n\nOn City struggling to find the right goalkeeper since he left, Hart added: 'That's their problem. I need to look after myself, I need to be selfish in this situation.\n\n'My feelings for Manchester City will never change, I'm eternally grateful to them as a football club.\n\n'They took me as a 19-year-old boy from Shrewsbury Town, took something of a punt on me, and I've had some fantastic times there and built some really great relationships.\n\nHart is preparing to line up against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday\n\n'The fans have been so supportive of me, even in the last year. As far as the business side of it goes, new managers and new opinions, that's football, I just have to take it on the chin.'\n\nHart's first Premier League appearance since May 2016 is at Old Trafford and he is well aware of what to expect.\n\n'I'm probably going to get a similar reception to the one I usually get there but it's business.\n\n'I want to go there and I want to win, that's all I want to do, whichever side of Manchester it is and whichever side of England it is, I'm going there to win.'", "timeCrawl": "21:34:00", "sim": 0.8549019694328308, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2016-05-", "textStart": 3639, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3647}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8846363", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "id": 33, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "id": 1582, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

I want to keep improving no matter where I am and what I'm doing.\n\n\"This season will be an interesting one, for everyone and certainly me and it's something I've always embraced. I love playing football first and foremost. Obviously playing for my country is very important.\n\n\"I'm still owned by my parent club and I was fully aware I wasn't going to play football for them, so trying to get football elsewhere to the highest standard possible was important this summer.

I'm trying to make my point to Gareth Southgate, they're my coaches, they're the people whose opinions I care about.\n\n\"I can't answer why City let me go. That's their problem. My feelings for them will never change.\n\n\"You can moan about it and you can make smart comments and try to work out why it was done, or you can get on with it. I have taken the latter.\n\n\"I come here, with really high demands on my team-mates because I demand a lot of myself. I'm here to win games, I'm here to try to improve, I'm here to try to help and I'm here to learn.\n\nAnd if everyone has a similar sort of mindset we have a dangerous squad.\"\n\nHart is ready for his next challenge. \"I'd love it to be a little bit smoother, obviously. I love football.\n\n\"Whether people want to say good things about me, whether they want to say bad, whether they want to pick me, whether they don't, I just want play football so I have to put things to one side. Sometimes take a few things on the chin and dig in and work.\n\n\"But luckily that's who and what I am, that's what I love doing, so working hard isn't a problem for me, digging deep isn't a problem for me, that's who I am and that's what I will continue doing until my body won't let me.\n\n\"I am grateful for West Ham to be given me this chance, because I didn't really have too many options to be honest.\"\n\nHe'll wear his favourite No 25 number on the back of his shirt, explaining: \"I didn't feel it was right to take the No.1 shirt. I'm currently on loan at West Ham and the 25 shirt I've enjoyed a lot of good times in it.\"\n\nHe neatly side-stepped backing City for the title adding: \"Anyone can do it, and why not West Ham.

No, it's something far more prosaic than that: he has a black eye.\n\n\"The induction was to have a fight with Andy Carroll,\" he jokes, but really it is the result of throwing himself around in training in preparation for the new season with his new club. It is a fitting visual metaphor for a player looking to take the Premier League by storm for a second time in his career, bruised but unbowed after his cold war with Pep Guardiola.\n\nRead more West Ham 2017/18 Premier League season preview: Can they bounce back?\n\nNot that Hart is desperate to comb through the wreckage of his relationship with Manchester City. There are new challenges to focus on in east London, after all, with Europe the aim for a new-look Irons side.\n\n\"That's gone. I'm not part of that club anymore,\" says the 30-year-old when asked if he will be trying to prove a point to Guardiola this term. \"I'm trying to make a point to Slaven Bilic. I'm trying to make a point to Gareth Southgate. They're my coaches. They're the people whose opinions I care about.\n\n\"My feelings towards Manchester City will never change. I'm grateful to them as a football club. They took me as a 19-year-old boy from Shrewsbury Town, took a punt on me, and I've had some fantastic times there, built some great relationships. The fans have been so supportive of me, even in the past year.\n\nThe England international has moved to the London Stadium on loan (Getty)\n\n\"I'll eternally have a link with them, but as far as the business side of it goes - new managers, opinions, stuff like that - that's football. There's no point taking it too personally because it's not all about me. Plenty of people have been in my situation and you've got two choices: moan about it and make smart comments, or just get on with it. I chose the latter.\n\n\"I have had to put things to one side, take a few things on the chin, and dig in and work. But luckily that's who I am, it's what I love doing. Working hard isn't a problem for me. That's what I'll keep doing until my body won't let me.\"\n\nHart made no secret of his preference for a permanent move rather than another loan this summer, but found a tough market waiting for him when he returned from Serie A. He is, however, clearly delighted that West Ham have offered him a route back to the Premier League.\n\nHart spent last season on loan at Torino (Getty)\n\n\"That was my ideal situation: I wanted to sign a permanent deal somewhere so I could set my life up and have a direction,\" he continues.\" But there weren't too many options, if any. If a club wants a certain amount of money and people aren't necessarily willing to pay it...\n\n\"It wasn't to be, and West Ham have been fantastic towards me. I couldn't be any more grateful for the opportunity they've given me. I'm over the moon to be part of this club. There wasn't an awful lot of movement this summer, goalkeeper-wise, so I'm very grateful.\"\n\nSo what of his year in Italy? Has it improved him as a player and as a man? \"It certainly broadened my horizons. It helped me to learn a different way of living and brought some new styles of football to me... different ideas, a different manager. I'd like to think it's helped me.\n\nThe keeper is already enjoying life at West Ham (Getty)\n\n\"But I want to be learning and improving all the time, no matter where I am. I'd like to think I'm a better keeper than when I walked through the doors here a couple of weeks ago.\"\n\nRead more Chicharito on Man Utd, the post-Fergie years and life at West Ham\n\nNow back in the \"best league in the world\", Hart is keen to get started, with a trip to Old Trafford first up on Sunday. It's a tricky first assignment, but the goalkeeper is hopeful that West Ham will be able to take their enforced mini-exile in their stride in the weeks ahead.\n\n\"We knew the World Athletics (Championships) were going to be at the stadium, so we're mentally ready to play away from home,\" he adds. \"We're looking to set ourselves up for that fourth game, to be in a good position to really enjoy our first home game. I know the West Ham fans are going to be dying for us to play at home, so we need to put them in the right mood when that time does come.\"\n\nMore about: Premier League West Ham Joe Hart Manchester City Torino Pep Guardiola Gareth Southgate Slaven Bilic Andy Carroll Reuse content", "timeCrawl": "21:42:00", "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8847004", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "id": 822, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Ham have brought in plenty of experience - and it could be the start of something, says Joe Hart, as he seeks to play at 'the highest standard possible'\n\nA dab of make-up cannot conceal the black eye Joe Hart is sporting as he walks into West Ham United's press room and the topic is swiftly raised: have pre-season preparations at Rush Green taken an unsavoury turn? \"Yeah, the induction was to have a fight with Andy [Carroll],\" is the retort before the less sensational truth, that he had received a ball to the face while spreading to make a save, follows with appropriate haste.\n\nIf Hart had taken a punch he would probably have rolled with it. He will start his loan club's opener at Old Trafford this afternoon, a year to the day since his absence from Pep Guardiola's lineup against Sunderland made it abundantly clear that there would be little hope of a future under the current Manchester City regime, and he does not hide the fact his situation is imperfect. Last season's hurriedly arranged spell at Torino was a means to an end; this summer, at 30 years old, he would have preferred to set down roots than be lent for another 12 months. City would have sold him for \u00a325m but no bid was forthcoming; some players might have sulked but Hart is a pragmatist and, besides, the stakes were too high in a World Cup year. He took the temporary move that offered \"the highest standard possible\" and the challenge in east London was one he welcomed.\n\n\"I think a permanent move was always going to be difficult,\" he says. \"I don't think there were too many options for that, if any. That would have been my ideal situation. I've always answered questions honestly, and ideally I wanted to be signing a permanent deal somewhere so I could set my life up and have a direction.\n\n\"But that wasn't to be and West Ham have been absolutely fantastic towards me. I can't be any more grateful to Slaven [Bilic], Mr Gold and Mr Sullivan for coming and making clear that they wanted me to be here, and I'm over the moon to be a part of this club. There wasn't an awful lot of movement goalkeeper-wise this summer so I'm very thankful to get this opportunity.\"\n\nHart describes the circumstances behind his move as \"business\" more than once and makes it clear that he did not want to sit on his \u00a34.5m salary at City. \"Not everyone in football wants to play football,\" he says. \"When you become a professional footballer there's no written contract that says you have to strive to play first-team football. It's a job at the end of the day but there are a lot of us, myself included, that just love playing football. If I can't play for my club, and logistics and business mean I can't be bought or sold but someone's willing to play me elsewhere, then of course it needs to happen.\"\n\nThere is no outward resentment towards City although there is equally no indication their goalkeeping travails since his departure for Italy - which has taken in unsuccessful experiments with Claudio Bravo and Willy Cabellero and will, for now at least, settle on the new signing, Ederson - do not puzzle him.\n\n\"That's their problem,\" he says of a position that Guardiola has found more difficult to fill than might have been anticipated. \"I need to look after myself. I need to be selfish in this situation. My feelings towards Manchester City will never change; I'm eternally grateful to them as a football club. They took me as a 19-year-old boy from Shrewsbury Town, took somewhat of a punt on me and I've had some fantastic times. The fans have been so supportive of me, even in the past year, and that's something that will never die for me.\n\n\"But as far as the business side goes, with new managers and opinions, it's unfortunately football and you've just got to take it on the chin. There's no point in taking it too personally because it's not all about me. The game moves quickly and you've got two choices: you can moan about it, make smart comments and try to work out why it was done or you can just try and get on with it. I've taken the latter.\"\n\nSimilarly there is no direct rebuttal of Guardiola's view, never publicly expressed but widely held to have crystallised in the buildup to 2016-17, that Hart's ability to build play from the back was inadequate for his requirements. The implication that he fared perfectly well with a comparable approach in Serie A is clear enough, though, as is the sense he does not consider this a politic time to offer more on the matter.\n\n\"I feel I can adapt to what my manager wants,\" he says. \"It was what Sinisa Mihajlovic wanted [at Torino] last year and I felt like I could do what he asked me to, and at the moment I feel capable of doing what Slaven is asking me to do. It's the same when I've been with England and any manager I've played under. I've felt comfortable that I can achieve what they've asked.\"\n\nHart has the confidence of Gareth Southgate, whose keenness to communicate with his national team players goes down well. The pair have spoken during the summer and Hart was assured West Ham would be an appropriate destination. He remained Southgate's first choice last season despite the upheaval he had undergone; one imagines it would take a severe downturn for Jack Butland, Fraser Forster or Tom Heaton - whose performances for Burnley last season he describes as \"a miracle\" - to dislodge him and he hopes a place at Russia 2018 will be a natural consequence of domestic success.\n\n\"I want to be an England goalkeeper playing for West Ham, I really do, and that's my intention,\" he says. \"It's a privileged position to play for the country and every single time I put on that No1 jersey for England I'm very proud and excited for what comes with it.\"\n\nHe will not wear that number for West Ham - \"I didn't feel it was right to take the No1 shirt; I'm currently on loan at West Ham, and I've enjoyed a lot of good times in the No25 shirt\" - and if star billing is unimportant, then there are others in the squad who can take that mantle. Pablo Zabaleta, his former team-mate at City, was a familiar face when Hart arrived and is \"like a brother\" to him; more eye-catching still is the arrival of Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, whom he once knew as a cross-Manchester rival and he now believes can give the club a spearhead they have long needed.\n\n\"I've loved his intensity, I've loved his professionalism, it's been great to meet the man and realise he's the real deal,\" he says. The new concentration of title-winning experience - Hart, Zabaleta and Hern\u00e1ndez have two apiece - in West Ham's dressing room should help a side that too often seemed directionless last season. European football is the target.\n\n\"I come here with really high demands of my team-mates because I demand a lot of myself,\" he says. \"I'm here to win games, I'm here to try and help, I'm here to learn. If everyone's got a similar sort of mind-set we've got a dangerous squad.\"\n\nIt is not a stretch to conclude that the last year bruised Hart rather more than that shiner to his right eye but he is keen to ensure the marks show only faintly.

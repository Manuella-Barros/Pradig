This growing issue has come to light after about 60 were transported back to India last week.Of those rescued in the operation that was carried out on Friday, 35 persons were from north India, 25 from Visakhapatnam and one from Bengaluru.Attracted by advertisements of data entry positions with good pay packages, these individuals, mostly with economically poor backgrounds, travelled to Cambodia hoping for a better livelihood.Meanwhile, the Visakhapatnam, cybercrime police arrested two more agents involved in luring unemployed youth to Chinese companies in Cambodia, Myanmar and Bangkok under the guise of data entry jobs. Kolukula Veerandranath, 37. a consultancy agent from Gajuwaka, had been sending unemployed youth to Cambodia since 2023. He was introduced to Ramakrishna from Anakapalli, who promised lucrative commissions for sending computer operators to Cambodia. Veerendranath and his wife Supriya had sent 17 persons to Cambodia.Suvaram Kranthi Kumar, 38, from West Godavari, told Deccan Chronicle that upon landing in Cambodia, he underwent a week-long training session, where he was instructed to create fake profiles on social media platforms to lure unsuspecting individuals. When Kumar was reluctant and wanted to return to India, he said, the agents threatened him that they would frame him in drug and human trafficking cases.He said that the working conditions were deplorable, and punishments were meted out for any failure to comply with their demands. The punishments included night duties, withholding of meals, prolonged standing, and salary deductions. He said that he had come across other workers from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.In five months, he managed to earn $400 to $600 each, which he sent back home.Twenty-year-old Kudipadi Siva Kumar of Visakhapatnam said his agent, Rajesh, took an advance of Rs 1.3 lakh. He travelled from Vizag to Kolkata and Bangkok, and reached Cambodia by car. He was coerced into sending Facebook requests on behalf of Cambodian operators and was paid $400 per month, starting December.Bobbi Bali Reddy, 22, also from Visakhapatnam, had paid the agent Rajesh Rs 1.8 lakh. Commencing his journey on March 9, his responsibilities included sending Facebook requests during his training period. He was accused of underperformance and received only Rs 30,000, half of his promised salary.A victim said that when they reached Cambodia, they were deprived of food, kept in locked dark rooms, and beaten with baseball bats. \u201cWe are forced to live in a compound. There is little to no possibility of leaving the place. Many people arrive there and get trapped\u201d, said a victim.They said that they were trained for about a fortnight by agents in the building. After opening accounts on social media wings, they were asked to join cyberfraud operations including in fake claims of high returns on investment stock trading and cryptocurrency scams. They were asked to join courier scam operations, where they call unwary persons and tell them that a parcel with their name has contraband.A victim said they were provided food only when they met a target, failing which they were beaten up.Another victim said \u201cIf we ask them to send us back to India, our own agents abuse us. We are mentally tortured to stay in that compound and work for them.\u201dSome others are lured with promises of data entry jobs in other countries like Singapore and Vietnam, but were trafficked to Cambodia. The passports of the victims are confiscated by the agents.Visakhapatnam cybercrime circle inspector Bhawani Shankar, speaking to Deccan Chronicle, revealed that efforts are underway to rescue 40 more individuals, with plans to coordinate with the Indian Embassy. He also disclosed that a staggering Rs 120 crore has been scammed over the past two years.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/southern-states/telangana/we-were-forced-to-commit-cyber-crimes-rue-cambodia-victims-895871", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/05/26/1092759-youth.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:15:30", "author": "Laxmi Pranathi,Prathyush Nallella", "authors": ["Laxmi Pranathi", "Prathyush Nallella"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.233}

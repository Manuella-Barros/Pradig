Benson said: \"The recent successes of our armed forces in various operations across the country are highly commendable.\n\n\"These victories not only reflect the strategic prowess of our military leadership but also the dedication and bravery of our soldiers, airmen, and ratings. \"We owe them a debt of gratitude for their relentless efforts to protect our nation.\n\n\"In the Ihechiowa community in the Arochukwu Local Government Area Abia State, the Nigerian Army, in collaboration with other security agencies, has impressively intensified their efforts against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\"Our troops raided and cleared IPOB/ESN camps in the Umudi Forest and Umuaku areas in the Umunneochi LGA, thereby liberating the communities from the clenches of miscreants and terrorists.\n\n\"On June 15, the Chairman noted that the Nigerian Navy Ship Soroh discovered and deactivated an illegal refining site in the Isonogbene area in the Brass Local Government Area, Bayelsa State.\"\n\nHe added: \"The Nigerian Air Force carried out impressive airstrikes on June 17 in Katsina State, resulting in the elimination of over 80 terrorists.\n\n\"These strikes, along with previous ones in various parts of the North West and North East, have significantly disrupted terrorist activities and enhanced the safety of several communities for their residents.\"\n\nBenson said: \"The House of Representatives remains committed to supporting our armed forces in every possible way. \"We understand the importance of providing adequate resources and legislative backing to ensure the effectiveness of our military operations.\"", "source": {"uri": "newtelegraphng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New

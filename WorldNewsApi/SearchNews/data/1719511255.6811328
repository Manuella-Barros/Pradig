{"id": 223786828, "title": "Pierrefonds-Roxboro still waiting for repairs on dike after 2017 flooding", "text": "\u201cEveryone on the street knows the city is at fault; everyone in the city knows it, too,\u201d Bodnik said. \u201cWe had water coming up through the cracks in our basement foundation. There was nothing we could do but get out.\u201d Bodnik said he won\u2019t drop his lawsuit, and hopes maybe a court will compel the city to finally act. \u201cI\u2019m just hoping they see the light at some point, and send people to the street to make them an offer to settle the whole thing,\u201d Bodnik said. \u201cI initiated the case, and I\u2019m not going to end it just because I don\u2019t live there.\u201d Jeff Arsenault, who still owns a home on the street, recently walked along the tracks with a reporter and saw the temporary fix that has been put in place. \u201cThat would work as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said Arsenault, who moved to the Laurentians several years ago to allow his son Jay to live in the Roxboro home. Arsenault added he\u2019s concerned portions of the rest of the dike, located between 1st and 5th Aves., has eroded in places, and that part of the dike could fail if there is another flooding event. That\u2019s why the second portion of the project is equally important, he said. \u201cThat really needs to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some parts (of the dike) that are very, very concerning.\u201d Martin Boisvert, who still lives on the street, said he\u2019s not surprised it has taken the city this long to act. \u201cWhat do you expect? The government is glacial,\u201d he said. In the meantime, the city has fixed some of the problems on the street, including restoring pump houses to proper working order. \u201cNow we have to get different agencies and different levels of government to work together,\u201d Boisvert said. \u201cIt will probably take another three years.\u201d", "summary": "Although plugged on a temporary basis with concrete and gravel, the city promises it will permanently repair the structure.", "url": "https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/pierrefonds-roxboro-still-waiting-for-repairs-on-dike-after-2017-flooding", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/montrealgazette/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/0524-city-flooding-0107.jpg", "video": "", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:09:56", "author": "Jason Magder,Montreal Gazette", "authors": ["Jason Magder", "Montreal Gazette"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.51}

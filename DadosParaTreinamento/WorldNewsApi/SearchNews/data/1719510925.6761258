Yes, you heard that right. Vanessa Welch, an anchor for Boston 25 news\u2014affiliated with the Fox network\u2014went on with the broadcast despite a fly entering her mouth while she was speaking. The icky moment was captured by viewers and shared on social media. The fly first appeared to land on her eye before Vanessa appeared to swallow and make a quick grimace before ultimately brushing it off and finishing her dialogue like a true reporter. Viewers are commending her professionalism and insisting that she \u201cneeds a raise\u201d following the incident, which you can watch below. \u201cThat is professionalism right there,\u201d wrote one Instagram user, while another commented: \u201cNah she needs a raise, she didn\u2019t even bat an eye (Well she sorta did)\u201d Another user wrote: \u201cI have NEVER seen that level of professionalism DAMN,\u201d while another shared: \u201cMy natural instinct would have kicked in straight away and I\u2019d have been a screaming wreck flipping tables and spitting that damn thing out my mouth.\u201d Some viewers are speculating that it was just a clump of a fake eyelash that Welch may have been wearing. \u201cLosing an eyelash is already embarrassing, but swallowing it on live TV? That\u2019s next-level awkward!\u201d commented one user, while two others wrote: \u201cTell me that was an eyelash, tell me that was an eyelash,\u201d and \u201cGuys. It was just a cluster lash that fell off.\u201d Believe it or not Welch isn\u2019t the first news anchor to accidentally swallow a fly while on air. In 2014, British reporter Adam Boulton of Sky News also swallowed a fly. While speaking about a reorganization of the Cabinet, a fly flew into Boulton\u2019s mouth and he was forced to swallow. One of his colleagues in the studio who didn\u2019t quite know what happened asked Boulton if he wanted to \u201ctake a pause\u201d to which he responded with \u201cNo, I swallowed a fly, that\u2019s alright \u2013 I\u2019ve recovered now.\u201d He then continued reporting his story.", "summary": "The icky moment was captured by viewers and shared on social media.", "url": "https://decider.com/2024/05/26/boston-25-news-anchor-vanessa-welch-swallows-fly-on-live-tv/", "image": "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/vanessa-welch.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1156", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/usr4ypWb-QVS3bn7S.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:56:41", "author": "Michael Haskoor,mliss1578", "authors": ["Michael Haskoor", "mliss1578"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.199}

Some new talent, a few tweaked gimmicks and a commitment to making the weekly show more essential might not have returned Wednesday nights to their 2014 - 2015 \"must see\" status, but nobody asked Triple H \"what's wrong with NXT?\" on his conference call this week.\n\nInstead, the focus was on a show Haitch calls the brand's version of WrestleMania. After two great live events and an historically important Women's title match from their first trip there, Barclays Center is special for NXT talent and fans. Their third TakeOver in New York City looks to have a killer line-up, but it's one with a surprising lack of story behind most of the bouts.\n\nThat's not because there haven't been stories and characters developed since May's Chicago show. But the bigger feuds like the ones Bobby Roode and Roderick Strong or Hideo Itami and Kassius Ohno have been involved in aren't directly represented, and some arcs have more or less happened outside a traditional rivalry, such as the building of Aleister Black's mystique or Zelina Vega's influence on Andrade \"Cien\" Almas.\n\nStill, there's a lot to look forward to, and odds are good this will continue the amazing run of entertaining TakeOver shows.\n\nWe won't know until later how the seventeenth NXT special measures up to its predecessors, but we can start getting ready for the show by looking at what brought us here.\n\nHow we got here: In his return to the company, McIntyre's looked better than ever. The Scot has taken out everyone in his path, including handing SAnitY's Killian Dain his first WWE singles loss to become #1 contender. Drew's also been single-minded in his focus to earn the NXT title and with it the fans' respect, as he strives to make the brand ours again rather than Roode's.\n\nThe veteran champion will tell anyone who'll listen (and even some who won't) about how he's made NXT Glorious again in his year with WWE. You can argue with the methods - and a lot of fans will criticize the overall quality of his in-ring work, at least in comparison to some indie faves - but the results are impressive. Just this year, he's successfully defended the title against Shinsuke Nakamura, Ohno, Itami and Strong.\n\nWhile these former TNA talents have jawed at each other since McIntyre earned the right to challenge Bobby in Brooklyn, the champ's big feud has been with Roddy. After The Glorious One beat him while mocking his family, Strong's been obsessed with getting his hands on Roode. When General Manager William Regal told him there was no way he'd get a match against his nemesis before or at TakeOver, Roddy agreed to face Drew on the 'go home' show for the right to fight Roode later.\n\nThat turned out to be a ploy by the titleholder to take out both his rivals in one swoop, which was our last image heading into Brooklyn.\n\nWhat to look out for: A possible changing of the guard.\n\nEven before he established himself as an in-ring threat in Evolve and elsewhere, McIntyre looks like the kind of man you'd want representing your territory. There's a reason Vince McMahon dubbed him \"The Chosen One\". As mentioned above, Roode's had a heck of a run in NXT, and he isn't getting any younger. It wouldn't be shocking to see the title change hands to signal the next phase for the brand, and a call-up for Bobby.\n\nWednesday's finish paints Strong as a wild card worthy of Charlie Kelly, though, and we have to wonder where he fits into things in Brooklyn. TakeOvers aren't known for interference or other shenanigans, especially not in main events. Roddy costing either man the match to continue a non-title program while the winner moves on to the next contender would be standard pro wrestling booking, but novel for NXT.\n\nWhere this match shows up on the card might tell us a lot. If the women go on last, it could be a sign that story is coming to an end, while Roode and McIntyre's is just beginning.\n\nAsuka (c) vs. Ember Moon - Women's championship match\n\nHow we got here: What else is there to say about Asuka. Her reign will be over 500 days long coming into Barclays on Saturday, and she hasn't been pinned or submitted as a WWE wrestler. Her accomplishments have been heralded by everyone from Goldberg to Stephanie McMahon. The Empress of Tomorrow's dominance is so well estalished, her defining character trait on NXT of late has been boredom.\n\nIn fact, after defeating Nikki Cross in a Last Woman Standing match earlier this Summer, the champ announced she wouldn't even return until Regal found a worthy challenger.\n\nOf course, that challenger's been there all along. And as Ember Moon explained during their contract signing this past Wednesday, she's the only woman Asuka has cut corners in order to defeat - or eliminate from competition. The champ used the referee to help prevent Ember from hitting her Eclipse finisher in Orlando, and then crashed a battle royal designed to determine her opponent in Chicago, injuring Moon by throwing her into a barricade.\n\nThat contract signing went smoothly, but the previous encounter between the two ended with Asuka taking an Eclipse. The story has long been that if that happens in a match, her epic reign will end. What tricks does she have left to avoid that fate?\n\nWhat to look out for: The end of an era.\n\nWhether or not anyone thinks it's enough, NXT has clearly been grooming Moon as the woman to finally beat the champ. They didn't pull the trigger on WrestleMania weekend, however, and most of what's happened since has made Asuka look stronger while Ember's only had a couple matches since returning from injury.\n\nBut if not now, when? And if not her, who?\n\nIt's probably past time for a call-up for Asuka, and all the fear about how she'll be booked at the next level that comes with that. There will be a lot of new faces after the Mae Young Classic wraps, too, so this feels like a good point to signal a change.\n\nBut the Empress of Tomorrow's survived this long without a blemish on her record, so it seems foolish to completely count her out.\n\nAgain, whether this is the last match of the night or not will probably be a good indicator of where NXT is going. Regardless of who wins, or where it falls on the card, the goal is undoubtedly to deliver a match which is talked about in the same breath as Bayley and Banks' Brooklyn I encounter. No one (or very few) will question the booking if they can accomplish that.\n\nAuthors of Pain (c) vs. SAnitY - Tag Team championship match\n\nHow we got here: Shane Thorne got hurt, The Revival got promoted, #DIY broke up (and Tommaso Ciampa got hurt).\n\nSnarkiness aside, it does feel like NXT found themselves in a position where the two tag teams ready for a TakeOver spot were both heels, so they built from there as best they could.\n\nPaul Ellering's champions had just put down one of the brand's promising-but-not-yet duos, Heavy Machinery, when Alexander Wolfe, Killian Dain and Nikki Cross appeared amidst a storm of paper. That turned out to be pages from the Authors' \"Book of Dominance\", and the feud was on.\n\nSince then, we've gotten much more logical, and physical, segments establishing SAnitY's mission to capture tag team gold, and some genuine animosity between the two teams. Akam and Rezar chased off the group before their leader returned, but once EY was back, the champs found themselves picked apart by Wolfe, Dain and company.\n\nWhat to look out for: HOSS FIGHT!\n\nWhile not to Asuka levels, AoP have put together a dominant run since debuting on our screens. SAnitY, meanwhile, have done a much better job wreaking havoc than winning feuds. The group got the best of Tye Dillinger until his going away party, and despite a WrestleMania moment in this year's Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, Dain came up short in his quest for a NXT title shot when he lost to McIntyre a few weeks back. Even while impressing with her performances, Nikki's failed in her quest for Women's gold.\n\nAre Paul Ellering's monsters a team where they can change their luck? Who knows... but expect the bodies to fly as we find out in Brooklyn.\n\nAleister Black vs. Hideo Itami\n\nHow we got here: Itami's WWE career has been frustrating - for the Japanese Superstar and his fans. The combination of injuries and missed opportunities didn't keep him from claiming a shot at Roode's title in Chicago, but when that didn't pan out either, Hideo started to crack.\n\nHis friend Kassius Ohno tried to calm him down, show him another way and even beat some sense into him. But after that last ploy didn't work out, Itami put him to sleep on the steel steps with a GTS, and we haven't seen Ohno since.\n\nThe quietly charismatic Dutchman, on the other hand, has done nothing but win in NXT. Talents like Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly have even started showing up from other promotions, vying for a chance to be the first man to beat Black in WWE. So far, none have been successful.\n\nItami's justification for his recent actions has been that he wants to be respected, by fans and his fellow wrestlers. And he felt particularly disrespected when Black cut off a post-match promo with his entrance. Hideo ended up taking Aleister's finishing kick, Black Mass, when he complained, and returned fire by assaulting Black outside after the show. That was enough for Regal to pit them opposite one another for Aug. 19.\n\nWhat to look out for: A good fight, and no small amount of intrigue.\n\nTwo great strikers like Black and Itami should make for a hell of a battle, and one that fits right in with recent stiffly worked contests NXT has been producing of late.\n\nBlack is clearly a rising star, and with no losses on his record, should be in the main event by later this year or early 2018. It's unclear what's next for Itami, seeing as he recently came up short in a title match and has been on the roster for quite some time now, but he should be near the top of the card for however long he's in NXT - and healthy.\n\nThere's the possibility of Ohno showing up looking for revenge against Hideo, or possibly even Fish and O'Reilly - known as the championship tag team reDRagon in Ring of Honor (ROH), New Japan and elsewhere - having their sights set on another shot at Black. Possibly with another ROH alum?\n\nAndrade \"Cien\" Almas vs. Johnny Gargano\n\nHow we got here: After taking some time to heal, physically and emotionally, after Ciampa betrayed him in Chicago, Gargano is determined to re-establish himself as a top solo act. He vowed to find his way onto the card in Brooklyn.\n\nAlmas, with the help of his old manager from Mexico (in kayfabe), is also trying to refresh his WWE career. Zelina Vega is helping Cien ditch his showboating and focus on winning. To prove he's ready for the spotlight, she accepted Gargano's open challenge.\n\nThat's it.\n\nWhat to look out for: Despite not having shared a scene together, a match with some stakes.\n\nBoth men are gifted wrestlers, so there's little doubt this should be a fun watch (if I had to guess, it probably opens the show). That's a plus, especially considering there's no real heat between their characters.\n\nLuckily, neither Almas or Gargano want to take a loss as the biggest match of their NXT rebirth. So while they don't hate each other (yet, anyway), they have ever reason to want - even need - a win here.\n\nThat should be enough.\n\nThat's our rundown of what should be a fun night of pro wrestling... however it measures up to the events which preceded it. Check out our predictions post from earlier for lots of opinions on how the action might unfold.\n\nWill The Glorious Era continue, or is McIntyre's destiny to end it? Is this the last NXT appearance for Asuka? Will someone get their head kicked off in the Itami/Black match?", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T22:00:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 86, "date": "2017-08-19", "freq": 2, "textStart": 79, "amb":

But exactly 24 hours earlier, the company's developmental brand will take center stage for its third TakeOver Brooklyn show from the same arena.\n\nThe card is jam-packed, and the event should be fun even if it may not live up to some of the tremendous TakeOver shows on the past before a majority of the NXT talent was shipped off to the main WWE roster. It is all set to go down live from Brooklyn beginning at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, August 19 with a kickoff show. The event itself will begin at 8 p.m. and can be watched live nationally on WWE Network.\n\nBig fan of WWE? Be sure to subscribe to our podcast In This Corner with Brian Campbell where we break down everything you need to know each week.\n\nNXT TakeOver Brooklyn 3 card\n\nNXT Championship -- Bobby Roode (c) vs. Drew McIntyre: Though Roderick Strong is lurking for a showdown with Roode, it will be McIntyre getting the opportunity here as he looks to \"save\" NXT from Roode's takeover of the brand. It would be a bit of a surprise to see McIntyre win the title in his first opportunity, and it does not seem like WWE has plans to bring Roode up to the main roster at this time. Prediction: Roode retains the title\n\nNXT Women's Championship -- Asuka (c) vs. Ember Moon: Asuka is the best wrestler in NXT and has been a tremendous women's champion for the brand. Unlike Roode, it seems like WWE could call her up at any time, though even if they do, it may be with her still holding the womens title. While Moon is talented, I'm not sure she's ready to carry a thin division. Prediction: Asuka retains the title\n\nNXT Tag Team Championship -- Authors of Pain (c) vs. SAnitY: It would make sense for AoP to continue their reign of domination in NXT, particularly since the promotion is void of strong tag teams right now, but WWE is badly in need of a pair like these guys. SAnitY also needs a push now that Eric Young has returned, and this would be a good opportunity to change the straps and allow both teams to move forward. Prediction: SAnitY wins the titles\n\nAleister Black vs. Hideo Itami: Black was ready to join the big time when he started in NXT, and he's been a stellar addition to the promotion. While Itami being repackaged as a frustrated heel has been solid, expecting him to take down Black clean is a tough ask here. Big things are ahead for Black in NXT. Prediction: Black wins\n\nJohnny Gargano vs. Andrade \"Cien\" Almas: A victory for Gargano would be a feel-good moment for NXT fans, but despite his tremendous technical ability, Almas is in the middle of a repackage and a push with his new valet. It seems like an opportunity to get him a victory over a fan favorite prior to him entering a feud he will ultimately lose.

NXT's special events always deliver, and that should remain the case when NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III kicks off WWE's four straight nights of wrestling in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nUnlike SummerSlam, NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III isn't available on pay-per-view. Fans can only watch it with WWE Network. A monthly subscription costs $9.99, though it's possible to see the event with a free live stream online since new subscribers get the first month for free.\n\nIt's the first NXT special event since NXT Takeover: Chicago on May 20. Several wrestlers enter the night having never been pinned since joining the company, and a couple of those unbeaten superstars are likely to lose Saturday night.\n\nNXT Champion Bobby Roode vs. Drew McIntyre\n\nIt's probably time for Roode to lose the title. He's held it since Royal Rumble weekend and successfully defended it against Shinsuke Nakamura, Hideo Itami, Roderick Strong and Kassius Ohno. Roode celebrated his 40th birthday in May, and WWE might not wait much longer to see what he can do on the main roster.\n\nPrediction: Drew McIntyre\n\nBobby Roode, pictured at Spike TV's 6th Annual 'Guys Choice Awards' at Sony Pictures Studios on June 2, 2012 in Culver City, California, will defend the NXT Championship at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III on the night before WWE SummerSlam 2017. Photo: Getty Images\n\nNXT Women's Champion Asuka vs. Ember Moon\n\nWWE has been building towards Moon defeating Asuka since NXT TakeOver: Orlando on the night before WrestleMania 33. The champ needed to cheat to defeat the challenger, and the NXT announcers continue to put over Moon's Eclipse as a devastating finishing maneuver. All signs are pointing towards Asuka finally suffering her first loss, though it's far from a guarantee. Asuka has put together an undefeated streak that's even lasted longer than Goldberg's WCW record, and WWE might decide to hold off on her losing until she feuds with a wrestler that's shown more promise than what Moon's displayed.\n\nPrediction: Ember Moon\n\nNXT Tag Team Champions The Authors of Pain vs. SAnitY\n\nThis might be the best chance to give The Authors of Pain their first loss. Akam and Rezar won't look weak after falling victim to the heel tactics of SAnity, who outnumber the current champs four to two when you consider Nikki Cross and Eric Young will likely get involved in the match.\n\nPrediction: SAnity\n\nJohnny Gargano vs. Andrade \"Cien\" Almas\n\nGargano was one of NXT's most popular babyfaces as part of #DIY, and WWE isn't going to give up on him because Tommaso Ciampa is out of the picture. Look for him to defeat Almas, starting his push as one of the top singles wrestlers on the roster.\n\nPrediction: Johnny Gargano\n\nAleister Black vs. Hideo Itami\n\nThere's a lot of talent in NXT, but Black might have the highest ceiling out of anyone on the roster (not counting Adam Cole). His strikes look like they belong on New Japan Pro-Wrestling, and his entrance always captivates the live audience. Black might remain undefeated until he wins the NXT Championship, which could happen at some point within the next year.\n\nPrediction: Aleister Black", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T08:44:00Z",

But exactly 24 hours earlier, the company's developmental brand will take center stage for its third TakeOver Brooklyn show from the same arena.\n\nThe card is jam-packed, and the event should be fun even if it may not live up to some of the tremendous TakeOver shows on the past before a majority of the NXT talent was shipped off to the main WWE roster. It is all set to go down live from Brooklyn beginning at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, August 19 with a kickoff show. The event itself will begin at 8 p.m. and can be watched live nationally on WWE Network.\n\nBig fan of WWE? Be sure to subscribe to our podcast In This Corner with Brian Campbell where we break down everything you need to know each week.\n\nNXT TakeOver Brooklyn 3 card\n\nNXT Championship -- Bobby Roode (c) vs. Drew McIntyre: Though Roderick Strong is lurking for a showdown with Roode, it will be McIntyre getting the opportunity here as he looks to \"save\" NXT from Roode's takeover of the brand. It would be a bit of a surprise to see McIntyre win the title in his first opportunity, and it does not seem like WWE has plans to bring Roode up to the main roster at this time. Prediction: Roode retains the title\n\nNXT Women's Championship -- Asuka (c) vs. Ember Moon: Asuka is the best wrestler in NXT and has been a tremendous women's champion for the brand. Unlike Roode, it seems like WWE could call her up at any time, though even if they do, it may be with her still holding the womens title. While Moon is talented, I'm not sure she's ready to carry a thin division. Prediction: Asuka retains the title\n\nNXT Tag Team Championship -- Authors of Pain (c) vs. SAnitY: It would make sense for AoP to continue their reign of domination in NXT, particularly since the promotion is void of strong tag teams right now, but WWE is badly in need of a pair like these guys. SAnitY also needs a push now that Eric Young has returned, and this would be a good opportunity to change the straps and allow both teams to move forward. Prediction: SAnitY wins the titles\n\nAleister Black vs. Hideo Itami: Black was ready to join the big time when he started in NXT, and he's been a stellar addition to the promotion. While Itami being repackaged as a frustrated heel has been solid, expecting him to take down Black clean is a tough ask here. Big things are ahead for Black in NXT. Prediction: Black wins\n\nJohnny Gargano vs. Andrade \"Cien\" Almas: A victory for Gargano would be a feel-good moment for NXT fans, but despite his tremendous technical ability, Almas is in the middle of a repackage and a push with his new valet. It seems like an opportunity to get him a victory over a fan favorite prior to him entering a feud he will ultimately lose.

The dominant Authors of Pain, led by Paul Ellering, will defend their NXT Tag Team Championship against Eric Young and SAnitY.\n\nCan both Asuka and The Authors of Pain maintain their unbeaten runs or will we see some titles switching hands on Saturday night in Brooklyn? What about Bobby Roode? Only three men -- Bo Dallas, Adrian Neville and Finn Balor -- have held the NXT Championship longer than Roode. Will his glorious reign continue against The Chosen One?\n\nBefore we get to showtime itself, let's take a look at the full match card, starting with the main event and working down the card.\n\nYou won't want to miss NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III on Saturday night, live from the Barclays Center on the WWE Network.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T14:54:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8313725590705872, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373927", "time": "14:54:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 4}, {"id": "315018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Roode"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Roode", "score": 3}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 4}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 4}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 4}, {"id": "340547", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Intercontinental Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Intercontinental_Championship", "score": 3}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 3}, {"id": "383378", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Championship", "score": 3}, {"id": "386419", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mercedes KV"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_KV", "score": 3}, {"id": "386420", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bayley (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayley_(wrestler)", "score": 3}, {"id": "448339", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Women's Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Women's_Championship", "score": 2}, {"id": "510496", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Eric Young (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Young_(wrestler)", "score": 2}, {"id": "516462", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Tag Team Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Tag_Team_Championship", "score": 2}, {"id": "516723", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Full Sail University"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Sail_University", "score": 3}, {"id": "614998", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "score": 2}, {"id": "693963", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Ellering"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ellering", "score": 2}, {"id": "760571", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Pac (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac_(wrestler)", "score": 2}, {"id": "764168", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bo Dallas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Dallas", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271586", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT TakeOver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_TakeOver", "score": 5}, {"id": "1271658", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kevin Owens"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Owens", "score": 3}, {"id": "1275615", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Finn B\u00e1lor"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_B\u00e1lor", "score": 3}], "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?&url=https://fansided.com/files/2017/08/roodedrew.jpg", "timeCrawl": "19:11:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III: Full match card", "originalArticle": null}

With another Superstar Shake-Up rumored after SummerSlam, I would not be surprised if this is Black's final match in NXT.\n\nAll in all, this edition of NXT Takover: Brooklyn looks set to be every bit as big and spectacular as the last two times WWE's developmental brand came to the Barclays Center.\n\nCorey Graves will be returning to NXT, as he will join Lita, Charly Caruso, and Sam Roberts for the NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III Pre-Show.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T15:12:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373927", "time": "15:12:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "218051", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303298", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks", "score": 2}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 3}, {"id": "315018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Roode"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Roode", "score": 3}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 1}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332483", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Johnny Gargano"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Gargano", "score": 2}, {"id": "383378", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Championship", "score": 3}, {"id": "479958", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kenta Kobayashi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenta_Kobayashi", "score": 2}, {"id": "498959", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sterling James Keenan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_James_Keenan", "score": 1}, {"id": "760571", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Pac (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac_(wrestler)", "score": 3}, {"id": "764168", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bo Dallas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Dallas", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271586", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT TakeOver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_TakeOver", "score": 5}, {"id": "1275615", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Finn B\u00e1lor"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_B\u00e1lor", "score": 3}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "01:40:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III: Full match card", "originalArticle": null}

And if the past is any indication, it could be a show-stealer.\n\nThe main event for the show is going to be fantastic. The Glorious One, Bobby Roode, has been dominant in NXT for many months now.

Asuka will put the NXT Women's title on the line against Ember Moon in what many expect to be the champ's final match in developmental.

We've seen rivalries come and go, new superstar debuts and character iterations. But through it all, there have been three constants in NXT -- its champions.\n\nBobby Roode, Asuka and the Authors of Pain have held their respective championships longer than any current reign on either Raw or SmackDown, but new challengers pose greater hurdles than each has yet seen -- especially with the NXT landscape due for some changes.\n\nFor the third straight year, NXT TakeOver will be at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. The two preceding TakeOver: Brooklyn events have exceeded expectations and provided an unparalleled live platform for everyone involved on just about every level, to the point at which the show can be considered the premier event on the NXT calendar.\n\n\"In some ways Brooklyn, for NXT, has become our WrestleMania,\" Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque, executive vice president of talent, live events and creative for WWE, told ESPN. \"In that, even though we do a show at WrestleMania, I think that at Mania, no matter what we do, we're in the shadow of the stadium, and we're in the shadow of the week; it's 'WrestleMania week.'\n\n\"At SummerSlam, in Brooklyn, it's a little bit different. We're all at the same venue, we're all kind of working in front of a similar crowd, and when we go back, Brooklyn is what put us on the map. ... All of a sudden this brand got built up and it became this moment in time that was like, 'Wow, NXT has arrived.'\"\n\nThis year's card has the potential to not only measure up to its predecessors, but also to outshine them. The event also presents a major challenge to those on all WWE rosters to evaluate where they stand in the company and what's next.\n\nFor Levesque, someone whose role is to continue to build the talent for the entire company, TakeOvers present an opportunity for NXT talent to shine. That's particularly true in Brooklyn, with NXT's event held in the same venue as SummerSlam on back-to-back nights.\n\nIt's a rare opportunity for a side-by-side comparison between NXT and the main roster.\n\n\"I want to make this better than any of them,\" Levesque said. \"It's a challenge, right? My goal, and I'll give a speech to those kids right before they walk to the ring. We've done it every year. Every year we pushed the main roster. Every year we've made the main roster watch TakeOver and think, 'Man, I've got to step up tomorrow.'\n\n\"If you're on the show on SummerSlam or you're not on the show at SummerSlam, and I'm looking at Bobby Roode. I'm looking at Drew McIntyre. I'm looking at Asuka, Ember Moon and all the people that are in that show. I'm thinking, 'They're right behind me. They can call those talent up at any time and there's only so many spaces on Raw and only so many spaces on SmackDown.\"\n\nWith a number of superstars seemingly on the brink of a call-up, the energy and excitement should be palpable. Let's look at the card.\n\nNXT Championship: Bobby Roode vs. Drew McIntyre\n\nThe NXT championship picture is in a state of turmoil. On Wednesday night's go-home show ahead of TakeOver: Brooklyn III on Saturday, Roode turned the tide in his favor by interrupting the main event between McIntyre and Roderick Strong to lay both of his rivals out.\n\nRoode and his 200-plus-day title reign will face off with McIntyre at TakeOver, but where Strong, who's remained in the picture for the past six weeks, fits into the equation remains to be seen.\n\nDespite an unsuccessful attempt at dethroning the champ last month, Strong's focus has not shifted away from Roode, who has made a habit out of verbally taunting Strong and his family.\n\nGeneral manager William Regal offered an attempt at clarity, scheduling a match between Strong and McIntyre on Wednesday night. The TakeOver: Brooklyn match was set in stone, but a win for Strong would have earned him another chance at revenge on Roode.\n\nThe outcome Wednesday night was far from clear.\n\nAs McIntyre and Strong were battling it out, Roode did everything in his power to muddy the waters. He attacked both men, forcing the bout to end prematurely. So where does that leave us for Saturday?\n\nRight now we still have a one-on-one championship match in place between Roode and McIntyre, but Strong's potential involvement is still very much in the picture.\n\nIt would not be a surprise to see Strong inserted into this match last minute, or at least get involved in the outcome. Levesque believes this particular main event should truly stand out among all of the Brooklyn offerings.\n\n\"This is one of the matches that I think in some way is really, in my opinion, is going to surprise a lot of people and be something more,\" said Levesque. \"I think people expect it to be good, but I think it's going to be something more than they even expect.\"\n\nBoth Roode and McIntyre have paid their dues elsewhere, but after joining NXT, Levesque is thrilled with the development they've made. Roode, as the champion, has continued to develop, even as he's led NXT as the champion.\n\n\"Bobby is a guy who came in with a long history behind him and a long pedigree behind him of being other places and being successful,\" said Levesque. \"He came in here [with] a lot of flash, but he had a long way to go in a learning curve, and an arc of where he wants to be and in things he wants to accomplish in his career. Even when he had the role, it was still taking him time to put his feet solidly on the ground. I feel that now his feet are solidly on the ground. ... He's where he needs to be.\"\n\nFor McIntyre, his return to prominence seems a bit more personal to Levesque, and Saturday night will be another chapter in a career that has been filled with highs and lows.\n\n\"I feel that Drew has finally gotten into a place in his life where he is willing to work hard enough to be what he should have always been,\" said Levesque. \"He's had a look, he'd had charisma, he's had talent, he's had all these things, but he'll be the first guy to tell you that it didn't work out the first time for a lot of reasons. ... I was thrilled to call him months ago and say, 'It's time.' I couldn't be happier for him and the spot he's in.\"\n\nNXT Women's Championship: Asuka vs. Ember Moon\n\nOne of the most anticipated matchups on the TakeOver card will see Asuka put her historic 500-plus-day reign on the line when she defends her NXT women's championship against Ember Moon. This is a rematch from TakeOver: Orlando in April, a bout that Asuka won because of shenanigans involving the referee.\n\n\"I feel like Askua has done a lot to change stylistically, and the impact and intent of the women's division,\" Levesque said. \"I watched her in Japan, just the limited amount of stuff that she was doing and I would think ... she's a game-changer for me. ... Asuka has done amazing things, but she can do more.\"\n\nJust three days before their matchup, the two met in the middle of the ring alongside Regal to take part in the frequently combustible contract-signing segment.\n\nMoon admitted that Asuka's run as champion has been remarkable.\n\n\"Asuka, you've had an incredible journey here in NXT. You are considered to be one of the most dominant champions to have ever stepped foot in NXT -- no, no, no. The WWE.\"\n\nMoon also offered her prediction for their match at TakeOver. \"At TakeOver: Brooklyn, I am going to end your reign of dominance. I, Asuka, I am going to end your undefeated streak. And I, Asuka, I am going to beat you to become the next NXT women's champion.\"\n\nIf that is the case, Levesque would have no problem with seeing Moon leading the way for foreseeable future.\n\n\"Ember Moon took a long time [to develop her character], but all of a sudden, man, she has come into her own as this amazing performer that is really ready,\" Levesque said. \"When I look at the locker room and I look at the people that are ready to take that mantle, and to headline a women's division in NXT, she's at the top of the list.\"\n\nNXT Tag Team Championships: Authors of Pain vs. SAnitY\n\n\"AOP has been here for a year and a half, all-in,\" Levesque said. \"I remember recruiting those guys on an international recruit and I don't think either one of them had been in the ring more than for a second. ... I don't even know if they actually even ever had a match. ... To be where they are, at that level, doing that in that a short period of time, it makes me think, man, does this system work?\"\n\nThe Authors of Pain have owned the NXT tag team division since they debuted last summer. Rezar and Akam will have been the champions for more than 200 days by this weekend, tearing down high-profile opponents including #DIY and The Revival on multiple occasions in the process.\n\nThey face a different type of challenge on Saturday in SAnitY. From a size perspective, Killian Dain and Alexander Wolfe stack up more than AOP's previous foes. The group also holds the numbers advantage.\n\nLast week, SAnitY leader Eric Young made his return, which allowed them to gain the upper hand on the champs. While there is a lack of true contenders in the tag team division, is it time for a change?\n\nAOP's greatest strength has been their undeniable dominance and taking a loss at TakeOver, even against formidable opponents in SAnitY, would hurt their image a bit. The outcome will be crucial as it pertains to their development as an unstoppable force. The one potential loophole would be SAnitY's utilization of their aforementioned numbers advantage as they look to become the only blemish on the otherwise untarnished resume of AOP.\n\nAleister Black vs. Hideo Itami\n\nAn altercation two weeks ago that saw Aleister Black interrupt an angry rant by Hideo Itami, leading to a Black Mass spinning heel kick to Itami's face, sparked this fresh feud full of potential.\n\nLater that night, a WWE.com exclusive revealed Itami's pursuit for vengeance in the parking lot, taking the conflict to the next level.\n\nThe two will battle it out on Saturday night in a match that favors Black, as he's been as strong or stronger than anyone on the NXT roster since his debut in Orlando. It's tough to fathom him losing in this situation.\n\nJohnny Gargano vs. Andrade \"Cien\" Almas\n\nWhen Johnny Gargano returned to NXT TV for the first time since the demise of #DIY last month, he stated, \"TakeOver: Brooklyn is the biggest show of the year and I have to be there no matter what. I need to be Johnny Gargano again.

Getting off to a winning start would go a long way in shining a positive light on the beginning of this stage of his career.\n\nAlmas has floundered a bit in NXT, especially throughout the past year. He has won a few matches but hasn't graduated to an elite level within the brand. His recent dealings with Vega and the modifications of his persona might be just what he needs to climb the ranks.

It's hard to say with any certainty. But WWE fans will get their answer on Saturday night at the Barclays Center. NXT has returned for NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III and the champions, Bobby Roode, will have his belt on the line in the main event against Drew McIntyre.\n\nThese two have been going back and forth for some time now and figure to have a phenomenal match. There's just too much talent between the pair for it not to be. However, what could help put it over the top into the stratosphere of greatness is the story that they've told. There's genuine disdain being portrayed and the future of NXT seems to hang in the balance.\n\nOf course, that's not all that's in store for NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III. Asuka could be having her last ride with the developmental brand before being called up. Still unbeaten, she puts her NXT Women's Championship on the line on Saturday night, facing Ember Moon once more. The tag team gold will also be on the line. The Authors of Pain will defend against Sanity in what should be a brutal affair.\n\nRounding out the card on Saturday night for NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III will be Aleister Black vs Hideo Itami and then Johnny Gargano vs Andrade Almas. Both of those matches have no gold on the line, but still have the potential to be fantastic.\n\nDon't miss out on a moment of the action on Saturday night. We'll be live tracking everything from start to finish with results, highlights and quick recaps before ultimately assessing the match and handing out grades.

Weekly NXT shows and special events provided a platform just as a transformational class of NXT stars was coming into its own, and that convergence allowed for something far beyond simply developing the next generation of stars.\n\nNXT became its own brand with an ability to stand on its own, with dynamic performers and storylines that energized a unique fan base. There were landmarks along the way, but the single moment that showed what NXT had become in the loudest possible terms came on Aug. 22, 2015, with the first edition of NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn.\n\nLike NXT as a whole, its special events started off rather inauspiciously but made an impact from the very start. The precursor to TakeOver specials, NXT Arrival, aired three days after the launch of the WWE Network as the first live event ever broadcast on the network. The show, highlighted by an instant classic between Cesaro and Sami Zayn and a Bo Dallas vs. Neville main event for the NXT championship, set the bar quite high.\n\nThe first five TakeOvers, from May 2014 through May 2015, stayed inside the friendly confines of Full Sail University. But from the moment the show hit the road for the first time, for the first TakeOver: Brooklyn event the night before SummerSlam, NXT took an entirely different kind of leap.\n\nThe event was a major breakthrough for the brand on a number of fronts, not the least of which was the scale of the event. To that point, for its weekly shows and TakeOvers, NXT superstars performed in front of crowds of 400 to 500 people from their home base of Full Sail University. The Barclays Center allowed over 15,000 fans to file in, and the pressure to deliver was high, but boy did it deliver.\n\nLooking back on that first TakeOver: Brooklyn card, the concentration of star power is stunning. With the exception of Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger, who appeared in a one-off match against Tyler Breeze, and former NXT tag team champions Blake and Murphy, every other performer on this show reached the main roster. The main event ladder match, featuring former NXT champions and main roster world title-holders Finn Balor and Kevin Owens, got outshined by a match of the year candidate for 2015 in which Bayley found her ultimate triumph over Sasha Banks.\n\nTo put a little more context into it, 2015 was a big year for women's wrestling. It marked the beginning of what would initially be known as the divas revolution, later the women's revolution, that has seen a steady increase of attention given to women's wrestling ever since. Just one month prior to TakeOver: Brooklyn, three of the most talented female performers in the company -- Banks, Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch -- were called up to the main roster. They provided an instant jolt to the women's division seen on Raw and SmackDown.\n\nBut Banks had some unfinished business to take care of as the reigning NXT women's champion. She put her title on the line against Bayley, arguably the most popular wrestler in NXT history. After washing out of both NXT women's championship tournaments in the first round, Bayley slowly fought her way up to the top, but she constantly fell just short. She lost her first two NXT title shots against Flair, and then continued to bump into the ceiling against Flair, Banks and Becky Lynch, including a four-way match between the women who would come to be known as the \"Four Horsewomen\" of NXT in which Banks won the title.\n\nAfter putting her demons behind her, dispatching Lynch, Flair and Emma in consecutive weeks to avenge past losses, Bayley was ready to stake her claim. She got her shot at Banks on the biggest possible stage, and the result was one of the greatest women's wrestling matches in the history of the WWE.\n\nBayley and Banks dazzled the crowd with well-timed sequences, innovative spots and an incredible story that finally affirmed Bayley's ability to win the big match. To top it off, we were left with the lasting image of Bayley, Banks and their \"Four Horsewomen of NXT\" comrades, Charlotte and Lynch, emotionally celebrating the performance following the match. It was one of the most memorable moments in NXT history.\n\nThe match was held in such a high regard that it received the NXT year-end award for overall match of the year.\n\nNot to be outdone, the final bout that night featured Owens facing Balor -- two superstars who could each realistically headline WrestleMania in the not-too-distant future.\n\nThe match often gets overshadowed by the women's match that came before it, but Balor and Owens put forth an effort in the first-ever NXT ladder match that remains one of the finest main events in TakeOver history. It solidified Balor as the top star on the brand at the time and raised the bar for all future TakeOver main events.\n\nThe Vaudevillains got their big moment, accompanied by \"Blue Pants\" (Leva Bates), as they became NXT tag team champions; Aiden English was actually one of the first people to say that NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn was NXT's WrestleMania. Baron Corbin took a big step forward in a slugfest against Samoa Joe. Apollo Crews debuted against Tye Dillinger, and Breeze got one of the biggest opportunities of his wrestling career by facing Liger in his only WWE-branded appearance to date.\n\nNeedless to say, the first TakeOver special in Brooklyn was remarkable. It set the stage for NXT to tour the world, and for TakeOver specials that could fill much bigger venues for all but two future instances. But as TakeOvers came to be tied to major WWE pay-per-views, an interesting convergence once again came together. With SummerSlam locked into the same location for four years (and counting), NXT would hit the same building for TakeOver specials each time around.\n\nAnd after blowing the roof off of Barclays Center the first time around, NXT proved that its home away from home was most certainly Brooklyn.\n\nThe star power at the event was once again through the roof, with the notable in-ring debuts of current NXT mainstays Ember Moon and NXT champion Bobby Roode. But once all was said and done, everything that happened in the ring was what once again illustrated just how special an event NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn had become. One need look only at the captivating spectacles of the entrances made by Roode and Shinsuke Nakamura to see how far things had come.\n\nTag team wrestling has always been a strength within the brand and that was never more apparent than when NXT tag team champions The Revival successfully defended their title against the beloved duo that named themselves #DIY. Loud chants reverberated through the building as both teams had a match full of drama and believable near falls that became another match of the year candidate. The crowd was so enthusiastically behind Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa that when #DIY lost the match, the air was sucked out of the place; this match would ultimately go on to enhance the tag team title matches at the next four TakeOver events.\n\nThe women's championship match brought things full circle, as Bayley's final chance at the NXT women's championship was denied by Asuka, who was still in the early stages of her now 500-plus-day reign on top.\n\nTo cap off the night, we saw the first chapter of the most intense rivalry in NXT history as Nakamura challenged Samoa Joe for the NXT championship and won that title for the first time. Their rivalry carried on through the rest of 2016 and into early 2017.\n\nFor 33 years, WrestleMania has been the Super Bowl of the WWE. It's the event that every superstar strives to be a part of, and the one that gets the most mainstream attention. While NXT has decades to go to approach anything resembling that level of attention, it's not too early to recognize that TakeOver: Brooklyn has become the most anticipated show on that brand's calendar by knocking it out of the park the past couple of years.\n\nTakeOver: Brooklyn III looks to continue that trend on Saturday, and the impressive card shows every sign of another first-rate spectacle -- one that will certainly be worthy of standing as NXT's biggest showcase of the year.", "dateTime": "2017-08-15T22:00:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1234, "textStart": 1209, "date":

Ever since returning Drew McIntyre has been on a roll, taking on all challengers and dominating everyone in his path on route to this match. For anyone who has enjoyed the rise of McIntyre outside of WWE, they will know that wherever he had gone, he has become champion and this writer believes that will be the case again in WWE. Whilst Roode has been an incredible champion, this is the perfect time and the perfect challenger for him to drop the title to as he then can place focus on a move to the main roster. On the other hand, NXT will be left strong with a credible champion who has plenty of challengers lined up and waiting for him.\n\nMW- Drew McIntyre\n\nIs Ember Ready for Asuka?\n\nBK- Asuka has been one of the most dominant champions in WWE and has been beating everyone that has been put in front of her but the one woman that she has not won against cleanly is Ember Moon. At Takeover: Orlando Asuka resorted to attacking the referee and a few weeks later on NXT Asuka had to injury Moon during a battle royal and Moon missed a title opportunity. Now Moon has her one on one chance can she \"Eclipse\" the reign of Asuka only time will tell.\n\nBK- Ember Moon\n\nMW- This feud has been brilliant and has been one of the highlights on NXT programming. Asuka has surpassed 500 days as champion and undefeated which is an incredible feat in this day and age and whoever does eventually beat her will get a major rub from it. Whether that person is Ember Moon remains to be seen. Asuka's cocky gimmick has previously almost got the best of her with Moon proving she is capable of matching her, but with the new Mae Young Classic around the corner, perhaps the winner of that tournament could be given the opportunity to dethrone Asuka.\n\nMW- Asuka\n\nWill SAnitY bring Chaos to NXT?\n\nBK- The tag team title picture was blown wide open in recent weeks when SAnitY decided that now was their chance to try and claim the title that are currently held by The Authors of Pain now come this Saturday I picture this being an all-out war but it will be a hard one to call and SAnitY will have the advantage in terms of numbers with Eric Young and Nikki Cross at ringside.\n\nBK- SAnitY\n\nMW- This is quite a confusing match from a fan perspective as both teams have been booked as heels which makes it tough to choose who they should be cheering for. SAnitY will likely have the crowd support and that is deserved as they've done a terrific job since debuting, but the same can be said for Authors of Pain and the way they've developed as a team. Looking at the tag team landscape in NXT things are a little thin and this is clearly an area that needs some focus, perhaps with Bobby Fish and former tag team partner Kyle O'Reilly now on the scene we may have a new team on the horizon. That team should be challenging AOP who deserve a monster run, whereas SAnitY can survive a defeat here and rebuild.\n\nMW- AOP\n\nWill Itami Fade to Black?\n\nBK- Aleister Black has been on fire since joining NXT and all of his opponents thus far have ultimately faded to black but now Black may face his biggest challenge to date as he goes one on one with Hideo Itami who was humiliated a few weeks ago when he was KO'd by the Black Mass kick and Itami is now out for revenge. Can he kick start his NXT Career with a huge win?\n\nBK- Aleister Black\n\nMW- This has the potential to be a show stealer in terms of wrestling quality with both men having a real storyline reason to win. Hideo Itami has embraced the darker side of himself after frustrations at his own failure, whilst Aleister Black has been unstoppable and seems destined for the NXT Championship. This one could go either way but this writer doesn't believe Itami is the man to stop Black, that man could appear after the match though, bay bay.\n\nMW- Aleister Black\n\nJohnny Wrestling Makes his Return!\n\nBK- Johnny Gargano made his return to NXT following the events in Chicago and he demanded that he receive a match in Brooklyn. Andrade Almas has adopted not only a new found aggression but he now has Zelina Vega by his side and she has helped him get the spotlight as she put him in the match with Johnny Wrestling on Saturday. Now will Vega be the X Factor in this one.\n\nBK- Johnny Gargano\n\nMW- It certainly feels strange to see Johnny Wrestling back as a singles star in the aftermath of the DIY break up but it is also very exciting as we get matchups like this. Andrade Almas has finally hit his groove in this new role and it is one that could give his career the boost it needed. With Zelina Vega by his side Almas certainly has the upper hand and this writer expects her to be the difference in this one, continuing the feud and keeping Gargano busy until his former partners return.\n\nMW- Andrade \"Cien\" Almas", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T22:00:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373927", "time": "22:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "206540", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "303298", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling attacks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks", "score": 2}, {"id": "304095", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Moon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "score": 5}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 4}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Roode"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Roode", "score": 5}, {"id": "324818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "328739", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tag team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team", "score": 4}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332483", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Johnny Gargano"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Gargano", "score": 2}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 4}, {"id": "351140", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "383378", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Championship", "score": 4}, {"id": "418646", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling battle royal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_battle_royal", "score": 3}, {"id": "479958", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kenta Kobayashi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenta_Kobayashi", "score": 2}, {"id": "510496", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Eric Young (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Young_(wrestler)", "score": 2}, {"id": "514622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Dudley Boyz"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dudley_Boyz", "score": 2}, {"id": "578633", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Fish"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fish", "score": 2}, {"id": "614998", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "score": 5}, {"id": "760572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mae Young"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Young", "score": 3}, {"id": "799327", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kyle O'Reilly"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_O'Reilly", "score": 2}], "image": "https://img.vavel.com/nxt-takeover-brooklyn-3-iii-1493647783.png", "timeCrawl": "10:48:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "NXT Takeover: Brooklyn III Predictions", "originalArticle": null}

Assuming Ciampa doesn't interfere, and this match kicks off the weekend while people are properly hyped before the mind-numbing dredge of 4 straight WWE shows in the same venue sinks in for these poor Brooklyn schmucks, then we might be looking at the WWE match of the weekend. Gargano is clearly so much more than a tag team wrestler, and Almas should have been the one main event-ing against Nakamura, not Bobby Roode. While I'm legit excited for this one, still can't help to see it as just another sign of the odd paradox that NXT has become, where you've got all these fantastic, seasoned performers who seem like duds if they're not successful in this \"training\" league, but if they do well here then they're stuck in NXT. Frankly, I'm just looking for good matches so whatever, but these guys used to give me tons of great matches, which was stolen by their poaching to NXT. So, in general I just want to say this: tighten up your shit NXT!\n\nWINNER: Andrade \"Cien\" Almas\n\nJUSTIN WATRY: A situation where both men should probably win. Luckily, I am going to do a rare 'fantasy booking' session and prove that even the toughest spots can have a reasonable escape plan. Here it is: Gargano is kicking butt, and out comes Candice LeRae to battle Zelina Vega! A mixed tag team battle erupts, and the fans lose their minds. Okay, only kidding. That is not happening. Here is the simplest solution. After a solid ten minutes of back and forth wrestling, Johnny Wrestling looks to close in on the victory, only for the theme music of #DIY to hit. The big screen flashes \"CIAMPA\" real quickly. One roll up later from Almas, and it's over. Vega celebrates with her man, and Gargano is left devastated. Think back to early 2004 when The Undertaker tormented Kane for months on end leading to his return. Ciampa may be out injured for another few months, but creative moves like this work when a man cannot physically be there.\n\nWINNER: Andrade \"Cien\" Almas\n\nKevin Pantoja: Like a lot of recent TakeOvers, this has some matches without great build but filled with top tier talent. This is one of them. Johnny Gargano and Andrade Almas are my two favorite wrestlers in NXT. By a fairly wide margin. This is my pick for the show stealer. Almas winning makes more sense. Gargano's the kind of babyface who can afford it (especially if Tommaso Ciampa makes an appearance) and Almas needs it. He's lost too often and with Vega keeping him focused, he should win.\n\nWINNER: Andrade Almas\n\nMitch Nickelson: I see massive potential in Johnny Gargano. I think he can be to NXT (and later Raw or SmackDown) what Juice Robinson is right now to NJPW. He can be the babyface of babyfaces. By the time Ciampa returns in 2018, I want their feud to be for the NXT Championship. Gargano should win here and keep winning on his path to the top of the card.\n\nWINNER: Johnny Gargano\n\nPaul Leazar: Boy, this match almost feels like a mistake at this point in time. Both guys could really use the win here. Johnny Gargano needs it to establish himself a singles guy on the up swing. Doubly so for the fact that we know we won't be seeing Ciampa again until some time next year, and having Gargano become a success story for Ciampa to come back to ruin could prove to be a huge story down the road. Almas, on the other hand, just got back on track with the addition of Zelina Vega, and really looks to have found himself. I feel like you could build up Gargano at any point though, and Almas really needs the victories to get the ball rolling for him. I like Almas taking the victory here with help from Zelina.\n\nWINNER: Andrade \"Cien\" Almas\n\nSteve Cook: Gotta admit that I'm a lot more interested in Almas now with the presence of Zelina Vega in his corner. She adds a lot to that act. Gargano's in a weird place right now. He should be feuding with Tomasso Ciampa, but Ciampa is out for awhile yet, so he's kind of stuck spinning his wheels in matches like this. The smart choice is probably Gargano, but I'm hoping that he loses due to Zelina interference and Candice LeRae shows up eventually to settle the score. That seems like something that I would like, and that NXT's target audience would like.\n\nAleister's been on a roll as of late,\n\ngarnering followers into his \"Black Mass.\"\n\nItami's frustrations have reached a boil,\n\na DQ finish I may see come to pass?\n\nWINNER: Aleister Black\n\nKevin Pantoja: I know they seem to love Aleister Black, but this not being Hideo Itami vs. Kassius Ohno is strange to me. That's exactly where it was building to. I think this one is quite obvious. Black is headed for big things, while it doesn't seem like Itami is on the same path. I'm pretty sure this is the end of Itami's NXT run. He's been there for a while and it's kind of NXT Title or bust for him at this point. He's not winning the title, so I say he loses here and gets called up in the next Superstar Shakeup, where he'll unfortunately not do a lot most likely. I say this as someone who loves Itami.\n\nWINNER: Aleister Black\n\nMitch Nickelson: This is a hard match to call. I imagine that Kassius Ohno will be getting involved in some way so Itami can take the loss and blame it on him. That will further their angst against toward each other and they can build to a big blowoff match later in the year. As long as the ending isn't too wonky with the potential Ohno involvement, I have this one earmarked for strong match of the night potential.\n\nWINNER: Aleister Black\n\nJUSTIN WATRY: Another bout where I can see both winning. Hideo Itami is the newly turned frustrated heel who is sick and tired of playing nice and losing, while Aleister Black is on a roll with plenty of momentum. This entire feud has been filled with hard hitting brawls, so that is what I think we will get. Thus, that means no winner. Just fists, slaps, kicks...and an indecisive finish. NXT tends to shy away from doing junk like that. However, it fits the bill in this instance. Black would be my pick if I had to go with somebody.\n\nWINNER: Draw\n\nPaul Leazar: If this isn't fifteen minutes of them just kicking the living daylights out of each other, I'll be disappointed. I like both guys a bunch, but Black is the star on the rise, and feels like he's being groomed to take the reigns with the NXT Championship some time soon. Itami feels like he's in free fall, but a great match could help him out greatly. I'm salivating at the mouth to watch this one go down, but there's no question to me that Aleister Black walks away with the victory here.\n\nWINNER: Aleister Black\n\nSteve Cook: One of these guys is on the way up. One of these guys has never really gotten to the next level. Black doesn't need to be losing to anybody in NXT, certainly not Itami.\n\nWINNER: Aleister Black\n\nJake Chambers: Are we at the place now where KENTA is enhancement talent for Tommy End? Is this what you're telling me? Ugh... Itami's WWE career is starting to feel a lot like watching former Pride legend Takanori Gomi getting constantly walked over by UFC fighters of lower and lower stature. The whole Aleister Black bit is really cool, don't get me wrong, but does it have to be at the sake of motherfucking KENTA? NXT has a roster of like 75 stockpiled indy stars, and they've gotta a feed Itami to Black? Nothing about their styles really play into each other at all, and for Black to maintain his momentum he's gonna need to generally dominant the smaller, less impactful Itami. If it were up to me, you'd have Black vs. Lorcan or Ohno, and put together Itami and Strong or Gargano if you really wanted to maximize what both guys can do. But the devaluation of KENTA is not something I'm looking forward to seeing.\n\nA certain level of intrigue flits about\n\nin this rare heel-on-heel encounter.\n\nAOP have looked the lighter shade of dark,\n\nbut their book SAnitY may well devour.\n\nWINNER: SanitY\n\nKevin Pantoja: People aren't talking about it enough, but the Authors of Pain have been one of the best tag teams in the world this year. The only teams I'd put ahead of them in terms of performance would be The South Pacific Power Trip and British Strong Style. #DIY and the Revival were great too, but haven't done a ton this year. Anyway, this matchup with SAnitY should be a chaotic brawl, with suits both teams. SAnitY is a lot of fun, but I can't see them as the guys to dethrone AOP and hand them their first loss.\n\nWINNER: The Authors of Pain\n\nMitch Nickelson: I like that SAnitY is essentially the babyfaces here even though there's nothing different about their characters from before this feud. I have no problem rooting for Killian Dain, that weird guy that moshes a bunch, or their ragtag friends. Their anarchist ways are endearing to me but that doesn't mean that I think they'll win. AOP are the champs and they're in it for the long haul. SAnitY are simply placeholders until TM61 returns, reDragon emerges, or whatever team of more traditional babyfaces show up to be a more permanent fixture.\n\nPaul Leazar: This one has the potential to be train wreck in all of the best ways. I think AOP has the tools to go pretty far in this business, they just need some seasoning. They're young prodigies in my eyes, and I think they are on track to be something real big on the main roster when they get the call in a year or two. I like this match up with SAnitY as well. Killian Dain is a monster, plain and simple. WWE thinks highly of him, and it's not hard to see why. He's a big guy who can go with just about anybody, and I'm really looking forward to seeing him work with these two. Alexander Wolfe, on the other hand, has seeming willingness to bump like a madman despite the fact that I think he's fairly limited as far as his in-ring work goes. That plays perfectly into how SAnitY has been booked though, and that willingness to die for the cause could lead them to capturing the championships. However, I feel like the Authors of Pain getting the long run makes a bunch of sense, and have a great feud waiting for them when TM-61 comes roaring back on to the scene. I like the Authors to overcome the numbers game here, but this one feels like a toss-up.\n\nWINNER: The Authors of Pain\n\nSteve Cook: The AoP have spent most of their time running through forces smaller than them. With all due respect to the likes of DIY & the Revival, they were looking up at the Authors of Pain, not looking in their eyes. SAnitY looks right in the eyes of Akam & Rezar, unblinking and unafraid. It'll be the toughest fight Paul Ellering's boys have had yet. That being said, I think the intelligence of Ellering combined with the experience gained in their previous wars gives the AoP the advantage here. As wise as Eric Young is, he can't match with Precious Paul.\n\nWINNER: Authors of Pain\n\nJake Chambers: Ouch, definite dud city. Perfect timing for any 411mania readers in attendance at the Barclays Center to roll through the cheap seats of the 300 section and meet ME! That's right Chambys, your idol Jake Chambers is gonna be at this show doing it like a real fan, in the back fucking row, where some moron can't chant his stupid shit behind you, or lecture about \"the business\" to some half-interested friend they dragged along. You can find out if I look more like a member of Sanity or a suited-up Mr. Dot-Com. Send me a message on Twitter if you want the stop by and give me a high-five, or hear first hand why the show up until this point has been a total piece of shit: @MatchADay\n\nKevin Pantoja: After TakeOver: Orlando, I felt this was a foregone conclusion. Ember Moon lost because Asuka resorted to a cheap trick. I fully assumed Ember would be the one to finally take the title from Asuka. Part of me feels like it could go the other way, though. With women like Kairi Shane and Shayna Baszler on the way, I could see them not wanting to miss out on the chance to book something big like that. Still, I'm going with my gut and picking Ember to pull it off.\n\nWINNER: Ember Moon\n\nJUSTIN WATRY: One year ago, Ember Moon debuted on NXT. For well over one year, Asuka has been undefeated in NXT. In that time, only once has Asuka ever resorted to dirty tactics to win. That was in Orlando against Moon. That is the story being told here, and I love it. After being so dominant as champion and officially showing signs of arrogance, the unstoppable force has finally met her match. I wrote about this a bit in my column this week, but I believe Ember Moon is the right person to dethrone Asuka. There is plenty of debate on whether it will be somebody new from the Mae Young Classic. I think it is Moon. The time is drawing near for more main roster call ups, and no doubt is Asuka on the short list to make that move. Pull the trigger in Brooklyn. All good things must come to an end...\n\nWINNER: Ember Moon\n\nMitch Nickelson: This is probably against my better judgment but I'm sticking with Asuka to retain her title against Ember Moon. Don't get me wrong, Ember is definitely ready for a title run and her promo on the go home episode of NXT showcased that she very well may be among the best female talkers WWE has. However, the idea of Asuka jumping to the main roster either post-SummerSlam or in the following months and eventually going into WrestleMania undefeated seems too money to pass up. I won't complain if Ember wins, I just think there's more potential in a long term story for Asuka.\n\nWINNER: Asuka\n\nPaul Leazar: What a match these two had the first time around, and I think they could easily top it here at what has come to be NXT's signature event that always has a rabid crowd on hand. They're just about as evenly match as any two women in NXT right now, but when does Asuka lose? That's been the question for a while now. Either show on the main roster could really use Asuka to come in and shake up the division, and while Ember Moon might not be completely ready to takeover the division, I feel like this is the moment to do the change. They could still rematch come Survivor Series time if they don't bring Asuka up, but giving Ember the moment here seems like a great way to make a new star.\n\nWINNER: Ember Moon\n\nSteve Cook: I know a lot of people are super impressed with Ember but I've never really seen it. But hey, at some point Asuka's gotta drop this strap if she's going to move on to bigger and better things. If there's a SuperStar Shakeup after SummerSlam as has been rumored, one would assume that one of the shakeups would be Asuka moving to either Raw or SmackDown. It's in hope of that happening that I'm picking her to lose here.\n\nWINNER: Ember Moon\n\nJake Chambers: Asuka is what I call a \"CNN wrestler\": when she's in a match it's like all of a sudden she's the most important thing in the world, but then when the match is over everyone instantly forgets about why she's supposedly so great. I guess it's a symptom of the 24-second news cycle culture that a wrestler who's accomplished so little can have one of the longest title reigns in \"WWE\" history. She can't really lose it to Ember Moon though, can she? That's the best they could do to end that \"historic\" streak? Because if Asuka is a \"CNN Wrestler\" then Ember Moon is the \"E! Network\", looks good on the outside, but not much substance.\n\n\"The Unchosen One\" has been spitting fire,\n\nbut his matches have been lacking.\n\nRoode's driving Strong up the wall, that\n\nmay well lead to Roderick attacking.\n\nMitch Nickelson: I've been loving Bobby Roode as champion. His matches haven't blown me away but he as a character is so good. His arrogance plays so well off of Roderick Strong, which has kind of put Drew in the background even though he's the actual challenger on this show. Even though the Roode/Strong rivalry is better defined, I'm not ruling out the chances that McIntyre wins. In fact, I'm calling for it.\n\nWINNER: Drew McIntyre\n\nKevin Pantoja: I just cannot get interested in this. There's no reason for me to want to see Drew McIntyre win anything expect for his name value. Like Black/Itami, this doesn't make as much sense as Roode's feud with Roderick Strong is much more interesting. There's a reason for even the casual viewer to root for Roddy. The personal issues are easy to relate to. Anyway, Drew and Roode feels like something put together simply because of name value. I'm thinking Roode retains. Drew will come close, though.\n\nWINNER: Bobby Roode\n\nJustin Watry: Without Roderick Strong still sticking his nose in the NXT Championship picture, that complicates this all. Without him, I would say Drew McIntyre wins, and we slowly transition to a new era. Roode is likely due for a RAW or Smackdown LIVE showing in early 2018, so it would be wise to begin that slow crawl towards moving him out. With Roddy involved, I don't know what the endgame is. Does he and Roode begin a non-title feud going forward OR is this hinting at Roddy being the man to beat Roode for the title and NOT Drew on Saturday night? Tough call. Then there are all those rumors of a bunch of former Ring of Honor stars ready to pounce. Usually NXT has a pretty straight forward and predictable card (not always a bad thing). The complete opposite is true this weekend. Lots of moving parts. I am looking forward to seeing it all play out.\n\nWINNER: Bobby Roode\n\nPaul Leazar: Here's another toss-up. They're are perks going both ways in this one. Bobby still has the feud with Roderick Strong going, and realistically, it doesn't need the title. Roderick has stated as much on NXT television, and I think that works out well here. Bobby has proven himself as a guy that can carry the brand, and that's what the NXT Title has really been about since the Kevin Owens reign as NXT Champion. Testing the waters with a Drew McIntyre run would be a great idea, and it's somebody who has proven himself greatly out on the independents. However, if the WWE still isn't sure, now would be a great time to do the change, and see how far Drew can take it. All that thinking aside, Bobby Roode's run as champion has been terrific, and I am just not ready to see it end. He's been a personal favorite of mine since his days in Team Canada back during TNA's \"glory days\", and it's just been so nice to see him book well as the top guy. I don't think there is a wrong choice here for NXT, but for me, I'm picking Bobby to retain out of personal favoritism.\n\nWINNER: Bobby Roode\n\nSteve Cook: It feels like it's time for the Roode title reign to end. NXT title reigns seem to run well past their end dates, but McIntyre feels like the next guy to pass the torch on to. Should be a solid match with two guys that know how to work the TV style. Roode's entrance might end up being the highpoint because it's usually pretty fantastic.\n\nWINNER: Drew McIntyre\n\nJake Chambers: Oh shit, TNA called and they want their main event back! Who's with me in assuming that the Takeover Brooklyn 5 main event is going to be Eli Drake vs. EC3, and at the seventh one we'll be seeing Mahabali Sheera vs. Grado?! I'd love to think that McIntyre had a real shot of taking the belt here, but that would be too good to be true, and frankly a waste of McIntyre. However, going to the main roster is no treat these days either, and there's no one there for McIntyre to bounce off with the indy style that got him back to the WWE in the first place. Eh, if NXT has kept this Bobby Roode sham going this long, no need to stop it now, might as well make him the \"longest reigning NXT champion\" of all time; a hollow accomplishment in a hollow era for a hollow wrestler.\n\nWINNER: Booby Roode", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T02:34:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373927",

Then in strode Drew McIntyre, ready to be a headline act; Aleister Black arose, making it instantly clear he was going to be a major player for NXT; and The Authors of Pain grew into their roles as bloodthirsty beasts atop the tag team division.\n\nThose bruisers will all step into the Barclays Center for Saturday's live special looking to prove they can be the foundation for the brand moving forward.\n\nEmber Moon will attempt to end Asuka's record reign. The Authors of Pain will defend their tag titles against Sanity. McIntyre has the NXT Championship in his sights.\n\nAnd the brand's newest acquisition may make a surprise appearance.\n\nPWInsider's Mike Johnson reported that former Ring of Honor champion Adam Cole has signed an NXT deal. The timing is such that he could show up to the Barclays Center to announce his arrival.\n\nThe following is a preview of TakeOver: Brooklyn III, looking at the matches lined up, who will walk away victors and what kind of matches fans can expect to unfold.\n\nAfter his friend and tag team partner Tommaso Ciampa betrayed and attacked him, Gargano is now a solo act. A showdown with Almas is the first major stopping point of his journey as a singles competitor.\n\nAlmas, meanwhile, is in the midst of a shift in attitude. The devil-may-care playboy has grown more focused thanks to Zelina Vega (aka Thea Trinidad) at his side.\n\nThis should be a solid bout from an in-ring standpoint and intriguing in terms of who WWE is more interested in pushing right now.\n\nFrustration has seen Itami morph into a more vicious competitor of late. He turned on his friend Kassius Ohno during a slow-burn heel turn and is now intent on climbing the NXT ladder with a new, looser moral code.\n\nHe faces one of NXT's hottest acts in Black.\n\nThe Dutch bruiser's presence, heavy-handed strikes and technical prowess have made him a star for the brand in short time. WWE seems to recognize his potential as a top-tier anti-hero. He's undefeated at NXT so far, taking down the likes of Bobby Fish, Ohno and Almas.\n\nThis bout promises to be a thriller flush with haymakers. Black and Itami are among NXT's hardest strikers, and there will be plenty of red flesh and loose teeth when this is all over.\n\nIn a rare heel-on-heel championship match, the unhinged faction that is Sanity will try to be the first to topple Akam and Rezar of The Authors of Pain.\n\nAlexander Wolfe and Killian Dain will have the advantage of their stablemates Nikki Cross and Eric Young lurking at ringside. And after Sanity has suffered so many losses with zero titles to show for it, Wolfe and Dain can change the group's narrative in a big way here.\n\nThis will be a major test for both teams, as The Authors of Pain have long had the benefit of top-notch opponents facing them, from The Revival to #DIY. Wolfe and Dain aren't that.\n\nBeyond retaining, Akam and Rezar will be out to prove WWE's faith in them as a top monster duo is justified.\n\nThe women's champ remains undefeated. She remains the unstoppable champion no challenger can bring down.\n\nMoon offers the most convincing threat Asuka has faced, though.\n\nThe Texas native is one of the best in-ring performers in NXT right now. She's a compelling, larger-than-life figure. Her ceiling is high, and she's most certainly championship material.\n\nWill she be the woman who finally dethrones Asuka?\n\nWin or lose, Moon promises to deliver one of the most thrilling matches of Asuka's reign. She can hang with the champ whether the bout leans more toward a slugest or an aerial affair. This has show-stealer written all over it.\n\nA cocky, flamboyant Roode has managed to keep hold of the NXT title since January by taking out his opponent's weak points or simply outlasting them. After retaining the gold against Shinsuke Nakamura, Roderick Strong and others, the former TNA star faces a hungry gladiator.\n\nMcIntyre is looking to complete a major turnaround.\n\nWWE released the Scottish wrestler in 2014. After tearing it up in the United Kingdom and the U.S. independent scene, he has stormed into NXT looking stronger, more magnetic and more fiery than ever before.\n\nHe's produced a number of smashmouth works of art at Full Sail. Roode, on the other hand, has had a number of underwhelming performances with sluggish energy. Something has to give when they meet in Brooklyn.\n\nMcIntyre is poised to snatch the title from Roode and replace him as the flag-bearer of the brand. Seeing him try, one boot to the chin after another, is going to be quite the ride.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T15:34:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373927", "time": "15:34:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "76", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "315014", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Total Nonstop Action Wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling", "score": 1}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "324818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 5}, {"id": "328691", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Independent circuit"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_circuit", "score": 1}, {"id": "328739", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tag team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team", "score": 3}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 4}, {"id": "332480", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tommaso Ciampa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommaso_Ciampa", "score": 3}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 1}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 4}, {"id": "383369", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Tag Team Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tag_Team_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 3}, {"id": "383378", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Championship", "score": 3}, {"id": "434547", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ring of Honor"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Honor", "score": 3}, {"id": "438376", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Adam Cole"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Cole", "score": 3}, {"id": "477358", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Chris Hero"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hero", "score": 3}, {"id": "510496", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Eric Young (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Young_(wrestler)", "score": 2}, {"id": "578633", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Fish"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fish", "score": 2}, {"id": "614998", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "score": 4}, {"id": "621757", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roderick Strong"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roderick_Strong", "score": 1}, {"id": "813801", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Thea Trinidad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thea_Trinidad", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271586", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT TakeOver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_TakeOver", "score": 4}], "image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/690/052/c9996d2c0a35844a75a96b414350cc76_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "timeCrawl": "10:48:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III: Match Card, Full Preview and Predictions", "originalArticle": null}

With NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn set for its third installment and SummerSlam both pencilled in for their usual place in the third week of August, the WWE will debut the Mae Young Classic -- a tournament featuring 32 of the world's best female competitors -- a week later on August 28th. Triple H (Paul Levesque) described the final two weeks before September as the end of a season in the WWE, but looks forward to what this busy schedule can bring.\n\nOn a conference call with wrestling media, Triple H admitted that the WWE are experimenting when it comes to how the Mae Young Classic will air on its WWE Network. Instead of airing weekly one hour shows like it did with the successful Cruiserweight Classic one year ago, the WWE is electing to release multiple shows at a time leading up the finals which will be aired live from Las Vegas. The WWE exec said the way his kids watched TV is completely different from how the older generation is used to.\n\n\"The concept to [my kids] that something airs at a particular time unless it's live, they don't get it,\" said Levesque, who says his kids will ask why can't they watch it at a time more favourable to them. \"It's a different world, they're on the internet watching things and with the Network, you have the ability to do that.\"\n\nLast year, the result of the Cruiserweight Classic was a brand new WWE show called \"205 Live\" which is exclusive to those under 205 pounds. Triple H gave his insight on whether he believed the women could possibly get their own show.\n\n\"The women, the opportunity is a bit different. While cruiserweights it was easy to separate them out and make their own show, with the women, you have hopefully a lot of opportunities, on Raw and Smackdown to beef up those rosters, on NXT to beef up that roster.\" As long as the women are getting an equal chance to show their prowess everywhere they go to wrestle, Triple H doesn't believe they need their own show. You can catch them exactly where the men are.\n\nNXT has proven to be a fantastic feeding system to the main roster. When looking at the SummerSlam card, each match features at least one NXT alumni, yet the roster down at Full Sail before TakeOver: Brooklyn, is ready to put on another thrilling show.\n\n\"People say, 'Oh they take guys from the indies and who have more experience,' but we still have to cultivate that and teach them how to do television. But we also created the Braun Strowmans and the Baron Corbins and people that came from nothing, who had no experience.\" Triple H said as he listed off more homegrown talent -- \"Alexa Bliss, Nia Jax, even Charlotte.\"\n\nAccording to Triple H it's proof that what the system was supposed to do is working, and though some superstars may not have success right away on the main roster, he says that nothing goes the way you plan it, and sometimes you have to take them out of the environment. Jinder Mahal and Drew McIntyre are prime examples.\n\n\"When both those guys left, you say, 'Look, go figure some things out, take your time, be ready for the opportunity because when it comes you want to be able to kill it, and they both have'\"\n\nDrew McIntyre will have his chance to kill it this Saturday when he challenges Bobby Roode for the NXT championship at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\n\nTriple H explained why he was extra excited for this card.\n\n\"Bobby Roode spending this year being this dominant champion, and making it his brand, and Drew coming in as the new guy wanting to put it back to 'We Are NXT.'\"\n\nHe also explained how the likes of Asuka and Ember Moon have reached new heights, how Hideo Itami is finally ready after all the starts and stops he's had due to his physical well-being, Aliester Black bringing something so unique to the roster, and the rivalry of Authors of Pain and Sanity being so unpredictable. Johnny Gargano is also set to kickstart his singles career in his first solo match at TakeOver against Andrade Almas.\n\nLevesque said the \"process\" of NXT has always been and is still very good, and these events have a WrestleMania type feel for the superstars involved.\n\nTriple H also wanted to give his thoughts and prayers to the \"Nature Boy\" Ric Flair after he was hospitalized earlier this week.\n\nRELATED LINKS", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T20:43:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 335, "textStart": 324, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-28", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367206", "time": "20:43:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Roode"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Roode", "score": 2}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 3}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 2}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332488", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Triple H"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_H", "score": 5}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 3}, {"id": "343955", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE Network"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Network", "score": 3}, {"id": "358623", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 2}, {"id": "479958", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kenta Kobayashi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenta_Kobayashi", "score": 1}, {"id": "614998", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "score": 2}, {"id": "760572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mae Young"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Young", "score": 5}, {"id": "1272228", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nia Jax"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nia_Jax", "score": 2}, {"id": "1273434", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Alexa Bliss"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Bliss", "score": 2}], "image": "http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2017/08/16/hhh.jpg", "timeCrawl": "20:43:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Triple H talks Mae Young Classic, NXT TakeOver", "originalArticle": null}

Last year, Shinsuke Nakamura won the NXT Championship in the main event against Samoa Joe.\n\nThis year, the intrigue may not be as high as previous years, but the match quality shouldn't be any less than we've previously seen from the brand in Brooklyn. The main event will feature the glorious Bobby Roode taking on Drew McIntyre for the NXT Championship, while the undefeated Asuka defends her NXT Women's Championship against Ember Moon.\n\nAnother match on the card for Saturday to keep your eyes on is the match between another unbeaten star, Aleister Black, as he takes on the No. 1 contender to the NXT Championship from the previous NXT TakeOver in Chicago: Hideo Itami. The Authors of Pain will also defend the NXT Tag Team Championship on the show against the wild bunch known as SAnitY.\n\nThere's only one place to watch all of the action from Brooklyn on Saturday night and here's how you'll be able to tune in and not miss a second of the madness from the Barclays Center.\n\nEvent: NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III\n\nVenue: Barclays Center\n\nLocation: Brooklyn, NY\n\nStart time: 8 p.m. ET\n\nLive stream: WWE Network, Fubo TV\n\nBe sure to tune in to see all the NXT TakeOver action from Brooklyn on Saturday night.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T10:10:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373927", "time": "10:10:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "206540", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 4}, {"id": "315018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Roode"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Roode", "score": 2}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 3}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 3}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 4}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 3}, {"id": "383378", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Championship", "score": 4}, {"id": "386419", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mercedes KV"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_KV", "score": 3}, {"id": "386420", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bayley (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayley_(wrestler)", "score": 3}, {"id": "448339", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Women's Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Women's_Championship", "score": 2}, {"id": "479958", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kenta Kobayashi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenta_Kobayashi", "score": 2}, {"id": "516462", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Tag Team Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Tag_Team_Championship", "score": 2}, {"id": "516723", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Full Sail University"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Sail_University", "score": 3}, {"id": "614998", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271586", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT TakeOver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_TakeOver", "score": 5}, {"id": "1418353", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Women's professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_professional_wrestling", "score": 3}], "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?&url=https://fansided.com/files/2017/08/brooklyn3.jpg", "timeCrawl": "15:49:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III live stream: Watch online", "originalArticle": null}

No pressure, guys.\n\nWWE's third brand prepares for its biggest show of the year with maybe the deepest, most talented roster they've ever had - one that is only getting deeper, Bay-Bay. The fact that established stars like Roderick Strong, Kassius Ohno, and Nikki Cross can't even sniff getting on this card is a testament to just how stacked NXT is top to bottom.\n\nThere is an argument to be made, that in terms of pure star power, this is the best Brooklyn TakeOver card ever and one of the best TakeOver lineups, period. Top to bottom, there one dud on the card, and every title could conceivably change hands.\n\nWith so much uncertainty, and new talent possibly showing up, let's run down the card match by match and see how many Adam Cole references I can make (ione so far).\n\nWhat I would love is for Cien Almas to go somewhere in any type of capacity. Pairing him with Zelina Vega (FKA Thea Trinidad) is a good start towards developing his character, but he's been in NXT since early 2016. Did it really take 18 months for them to say 'Hey, maybe give him a valet?\" To this point, he's kind of just been the handsome dude with great hair that loses almost every match.\n\nIn his four appearances on TakeOver shows, he has lost to Aleister Black, Roddy Strong, and Bobby Roode and he's only beaten Tye Dillinger, back when Dillinger was the handsome dude that lost every match.\n\nIt's great to see Johnny Gargano back in NXT, where he is probably their best pure babyface since Sami Zayn. His story is pretty easy to tell; he gets betrayed by his partner and best friend, starts a singles run, and when he finally gets to the top, his partner comes back to ruin it. The Gargano/Ciampa feud that's going to happen in like a year is going to be like 178 fire emojis, just the absolute best.\n\nIf that's the direction they go with Johnny 'Sports Entertainment' (shout out to everyone on Twitter I borrowed that from), then just have him lose here as people are still going to love him no matter what. They have a chance to make two guys in one match, especially if Almas doesn't go over clean. I'm very into these two feuding for a couple months. But since the story is too easy, Gargano probably taps Almas in like eight minutes and I keep eating and enjoying my Triscuits and hummus.\n\nHey, hi, hello NXT fans -- are you ready for the best match on the show?\n\nJust let these two cave each others' chests in with kicks and send everyone home happy. Itami has had the worst luck I can ever remember for someone with all his talent. Each potential push has had to be stopped because of serious fluke injuries. It's just a shame that Aleister Black is going to kick his head off.\n\nI can't believe how well Black's character has gotten over considering he just knocks people's heads off with a kick and then sits down criss-cross applesauce style. It's a combination of his incredible look and style that makes everything he does feel like a big deal. Typically when someone gets the type of booking he has, one where he beats everyone, doesn't talk, etc. It's usually someone like Braun Strowman before he started talking and having the best lines ever, not someone 'regular sized' like Black is. It's very cool to see. His entrance is very cool to see too, and might be even cooler if they do some kind of live performance to go with it.\n\nThese two seem to match up so well on paper and both excel in all out sprint type matches. If we get 10-13 minutes, it could steal the show on the level Pete Dunne/Tyler Bate from the last TakeOver.\n\nWho are the fans supposed to be rooting for in this match? Both are essentially heel teams but still get cheered either because of how good the matches are and/or how captivating their personas might be. Apparently in house show matches, SAnitY are coming off as the faces, so let's go with that -- the group that literally is about causing chaos and interferes in tons of matches as the good guys.\n\nI think the Authors of Pain have had great matches with everyone on every stage and are more than ready to get called up to the main roster. That's why I don't mind putting the belts on SAnitY and letting AOP go up to Raw, which has exactly one heel tag team (Cesaro and Sheamus) worth any salt, so they certainly could use an infusion of talent.\n\nSAnity is really in a good spot to carry NXT's tag team division right now. Outside of them and AOP, they're really isn't a whole lot going on which means this is a perfect opportunity for them to have a long run as a dominant heel(-ish?) team. They would be a perfect feud for Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly should WWE decide to reform their old tag team reDragon. They would even be a better match with the stable of ex-Ring of Honor talents that is rumored to soon exist once the likes of Adam Cole and others debut.\n\nEach time I write one of these previews, it's usually something like 'Asuka is the best'. So, Asuka is the best. There is a strong argument to be made that she is the best NXT signing, possibly ever. Completely dominant and tone-perfect in whatever role she plays, Asuka truly is the best performer on NXT, and maybe in the whole company period. She has the winning streak, she's beaten everyone, and there is nothing left for her to do. There are arguments that the NXT women's division needs her to anchor a thin division. But with Ember Moon, Nikki Cross, Ruby Riot, Peyton Royce, Billie Kay and the potential signings from the Mae Young Classic, the division will be just fine if she moves on.\n\nSo, what's up with this match? Do we care? Kind of? I guess? I'm pretty into Moon not being a supernatural wolf/warrior/thing/whatever and just being a wrestler. Her in-ring talent is never in doubt, but the character and mic work is what is holding her back. She's shown signs of improvement over the last few episodes of NXT when given time, but her work pales to even lower card acts like Royce/Kaye.\n\nThere has never been someone like Asuka in NXT. Usually, you can see the 'next champion' or the logical progression of someone up the card. But with someone like Asuka, who is the overpowered, fully leveled up superboss of an entire division, is it ever going to feel like someone can beat them? Nope. It will never feel that way, but she can't stay in NXT forever...just like Monday Nights can't have the same four women wrestling each other every week, right?\n\nIf they do decide to keep the belt on Asuka, they should absolutely let her go to Raw with it and use the Mae Young Classic to determine who gets to face Ember/Ruby Riot/Nikki Cross for the belt at the next TakeOver.\n\nAs is often the case with Roode's matches during his title reign, or his entire NXT tenure honestly, this is the match I'm least looking forward to. I think that all of his matches are fine, but they have a finite ceiling, kind of like a low-rent version of Randy Orton who wrestles exactly like peak-era HHH.\n\nYou know just about what you're going to get out of a Roode match and it's usually good, but I get excited for matches that could be great. That said, I wonder if someone like McIntyre is just the person to get that match out of him. Their styles seem to mesh well from every aspect, so hopefully they can put on something memorable. I would tend to think so considering this is McIntyre's return to the company from a 'Live Special' capacity.\n\nWhat I love the most about McIntyre, and what shows how comfortable he has gotten as a performer, is that he is doing a version of his gimmick from his time in EVOLVE, but doing it completely as a face. In EVOLVE, he was trying to 'save' it, to rebuild it in his image and now he is trying to take back 'our NXT' from Roode.\n\nHis promos have been great and his ring work is beyond impressive; he really is the guy to be the face of NXT, something that hasn't existed since Finn Balor. Sure other guys have had the title, but it was Balor that was associated with the brand most heavily. It was Finn you thought about when you thought about NXT. Drew has the chance to be that guy.\n\nThe great thing about McIntyre's current character is that it can flip between face and heel immediately depending on who the next challenger is. He just flips from our NXT to MY NXT and it's an instant tone shift. If you couldn't tell, I absolutely love what they are doing with him since his return.\n\nShould he take the belt here? Probably not. My favorite thing about NXT is that no matter when you predict or project a result, you also have to think about where the characters go moving forward. Roode doesn't need to be on the main roster, and losing the belt here would hurt him tremendously. Let him retain, but not cleanly and then let Drew win the belt and have him be the face that moves NXT into 2018.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T17:34:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

The Authors have run roughshod over the NXT tag team division since they won the titles about seven months ago, but the key is they've won them against teams who are going to come at them with a logical plan. TM61, Revival and DIY are all smart teams, but they're also teams you can plan for. How do you plan for a pair of crazy monsters? Can the Authors really hang on against these two?\n\nYeah I kind of think they can. The more I think about it, the more I think Sanity is better suited for the main roster (imagine them as part of a re-energized Wyatt Family or just something more like them) than the Authors. The problem is the Authors aren't exactly the most in-depth team in the world and I'm not sure what they would do on the main roster. Once they lose a match, a lot of their mystique goes away. Sanity has a lot more depth and that would suit them better on the main roster, perhaps as the people tormenting Breezango? The Authors retain, pinning Wolfe in the process.\n\nHere's how we got to the title match with a lot of mind games included.\n\nRelive the chaotic rivalry between SAnitY and The Authors of Pain: WWE NXT, Aug. 16, 2017\n\nAleister Black vs. Hideo Itami\n\nThis is all about who can kick the hardest and while the ending may look pretty obvious, that doesn't mean the match won't be entertaining. Itami has had a much better edge in recent months, all starting back when he lost to Bobby Roode in Chicago. Black on the other hand has turned into one of the best characters on the roster as he's just freaking cool. His entrance is awesome, his calm is sweet and that Black Mass kick looks like it could stop anyone.\n\nIn what isn't the most surprising choice in the world, I'll take Black to win after one heck of a hard hitting (or kicking in this case) match. It's pretty clear that Black is going to be one of the bigger stars going forward and I wouldn't be surprised to see him getting the title at a big show in the future. Itami's floundering continues but there's nothing wrong with being the heel gatekeeper who you beat on your way to becoming a bigger star down the line. Black wins, likely with a great looking Black Mass.\n\nWant to see how Black does at kicking people in the head?\n\nIf NXT timed this to coincide with the lunar eclipse on Monday, they're some of the most brilliant people I've seen in years. I don't think that's actually the case but you know Mauro Ranallo is going to mention it about a million times on Saturday. Asuka has been a dominant force for well over a year now but WWE has built up the Eclipse as the deadliest weapon in NXT. Moon isn't as great overall as Asuka, but Asuka doesn't have anything that can hang with that one big move.\n\nI'll take Moon to become the new champion but it doesn't feel like she's ready to win the thing just yet. The problem here is Asuka has been built up as completely unstoppable and that makes it really hard to take the title off of her. Moon is going to need a lot more than just one move to make her a champion and that needs to be showcased in this match. The pinfall is going to be a big deal but if they don't earn their way there, it's risking a major failure. Asuka needs to go straight to the main roster after this as there's just no reason for her left to do in NXT.\n\nFrom this week, the champ gets ready to face her biggest challenge yet.\n\nEmber Moon says Asuka is afraid of the truth: WWE NXT, Aug. 2, 2017\n\nJohnny Gargano vs. Andrade Cien Almas\n\nNow this one actually interests me more than almost anything else all night long for one simple reason: I'm not completely sure who is going to win. There's no reason to believe that either of them should lose as Almas has grown a lot as a heel while Gargano has gotten one heck of a rub since the DIY split. You really could go with either of them winning here, which really isn't something you would expect most of the time on a Takeover.\n\nI think I'll actually take Almas as Gargano seems like someone who can bounce back up from a single loss with a lot less effort. By putting Zelina Vega out there so recently, it would be a huge question mark to have Gargano beat Almas so quickly. Let Almas get a big win for a change and then Gargano can come right back with a win later on. Granted you could say the exact same thing with the names reversed, but I'll take Almas to win here in a pick likely to go wrong.\n\nHere's how the new Johnny Wrestling works on his own.\n\nThe more I think about it, the less I'm sure that McIntyre wins here and it's because of the Roderick Strong match coming up. There isn't much of a story to McIntyre rising up to the title but Strong is right there ready to defeat Roode and take the title. Then you can have McIntyre go down the ladder a bit and rise back up to get the title later. McIntyre keeps talking about how he took things too lightly back in the day and now he needs to be more serious. What better way to test that than by having him lose here and build himself back up?\n\nI'll take Roode to retain the title here, likely through something other than a clean win. Have him get a pin with his feet on the ropes or something like a DQ but I wouldn't be surprised to see him retain the title. McIntyre's day will come, but I have a feeling it's not coming just yet. We'll go with Roode retaining the title, but don't be surprised if they go with McIntyre winning for the feel good moment to end the show.\n\nThis is a show where everything is going to come down to the booking. We could have some great matches and that's all that it needs to have an awesome show, but the right choices really need to work at the same time. It doesn't feel like the biggest show of the year but that's definitely how NXT sees Saturday night. The 15,000 people in the crowd probably won't hurt either.\n\nRemember to check out my website at kbwrestlingreviews.com, follow me on Twitter @kbreviews and pick up the Complete 2002 Monday Night Raw Reviews in either E-Book or Paperback.

Over recent years, some fans will criticize the powers that be for bringing up an NXT star too or keeping a talent in NXT for too long. Passionate fans can feel the momentum of a performer, so the logic is to push them when they're red-hot, but Triple H has revealed the process is a lot more complicated.\n\nThe Game just participated in the regular media call that happens before every NXT Takeover event. With NXT Takeover: Brooklyn II coming up this weekend, Triple H spoke on a variety of topics regarding NXT, and he went into a great amount of detail about how he and Vince McMahon make the decision to call-up a talent from NXT and bring them to the main roster. For starters, The Game revealed his ultimate goal.\n\n\"It's my job to then creatively work with the team both main roster and my own team to say when is the right strategic time to put the person into the right place that they need to go to so they have the best opportunity in front of them and to make sure they're ready.\"\n\nTriple H revealed a lot about how he and Vince McMahon talk about the talent in NXT that are on the cusp of being moved to Raw or SmackDown Live. In a nutshell, The Boss trusts HHH and his team to have their opinion on a talent's progress in developmental. Vince will occasionally ask for an update on someone, but he mostly let Triple H make the call. More than anything, the latter just wants to give him the best chance.\n\nIt's easy for the fans to watch WWE programming and say that Bayley, Finn Balor, or Bobby Roode are \"too good\" for NXT. Neither Vince nor HHH doubts the talent of someone like Bobby Roode. WWE officials are trying to pick the right time based on a talent's progression. The timing has to be right on WWE television as well, and roster moves should benefit the continued growth of NXT as the third brand in the company.\n\nOf course, mistakes are made. However, NXT has also taken over Raw and SmackDown over the past three years. If you look at the main roster, a great number of WWE Superstars on both brands came up through the NXT system. Wrestling fans can have high expectations for a debut on the main roster, especially for a wrestler they've known for awhile. The ultimate goal of the process to make everyone is in the best position to be successful, but it's just a reality that not everyone will be.

This might be the sternest challege that The Glorious One has faced to his title since seeing off Nakamura previous year, and it's going to be interesting to see how he deals with the sheer brute force of McIntyre.\n\nTo round out the card, SAnitY will challenge The Authors of Pain for their tag titles. Nikki Cross and Eric Young will be at ringside.

If you're a fan of WWE and don't pay a lot of attention to their developmental brand, though, this would be a fantastic night to start, because this is shaping up to be a very fun, very meaningful, and very watchable show.\n\nThere's only five matches on the card -- less than half of that of WWE's SummerSlam extravaganza in the same building 24 hours later -- but if the first two Takeover: Brooklyn shows that NXT put on the last two summers were any indication, NXT is going to be setting a very, very high bar of quality for the main roster to live up to.\n\nBoth events saw some absolutely monumental matches, like Bayley winning the NXT Women's Championship from Sasha, the Finn Balor-Kevin Owens ladder match for the NXT Championship, the incredible NXT Tag Team Championship match between The Revival and DIY, and Shinsuke Nakamura winning the NXT Championship from Samoa Joe. Now most of those talents are on the main roster getting ready to put on a show of their own on Sunday, leaving a new batch of top-shelf NXT talent ready to make their mark on what's become their brand's version of WrestleMania.\n\nBobby Roode comes into Takeover as the dominant champion of NXT, but after months of being chased by Roderick Strong, now he has to deal with the focused lethality of Drew McIntyre. The hulking Scotsman is back in the WWE after several years away following his failed first stint with the company, and now he's got a focus and intensity that we never saw from him the first time around. This might be the sternest challege that The Glorious One has faced to his title since seeing off Nakamura last year, and it's going to be interesting to see how he deals with the sheer brute force of McIntyre.\n\nSpeaking of lethal intensity, those are the best words to describe the mood of Ember Moon of late as she's methodically chased down long-reigning NXT Women's Champion Asuka and her record-shattering undefeated streak. Moon still holds a grudge over Asuka turning to underhanded tactics to beat her at Takeover: Orlando earlier this year and then injuring her shortly after, and she's cut a blazing path through the women's division to get her hands on the champion again. Asuka hasn't backed down from that challenge, and given their confrontations over the past couple of weeks, these two women look ready to tear the Barclays Center down to settle their grudge.\n\nThe NXT Tag Team Championship matches at the last two Takeover: Brooklyn shows have been major highlights both years, and this year looks like it will be no different, with the dominant, brute force of the Authors of Pain defending their titles against the unpredictable chaos of Sanity. Eric Young's chaotic faction has set their sights on the tag team champions and manager Paul Ellering, and got them best of them in a surprising confrontation last week. These two teams will put body and soul on the line in this match, and there's every reason to expect this match to be incredibly physical to a degree that no other fight in WWE this weekend can match.\n\nThere's also two non-title matches on the card for Takeover, but they certainly don't lack for importance. Johnny Gargano returns for just his second match since Takeover: Chicago, when he was betrayed and beaten down by his then-tag team partner Tommaso Ciampa after losing a tag titles ladder match to the Authors of Pain. He can't get his hands on the injured Ciampa yet, but he accepted a challenge from Andrade \"Cien\" Almas, who is looking to resurrect his flagging career under the guidance of his new manager, Zelina Vega.\n\nThen there's the ambivalent-but-violent Aleister Black, who so far in his young NXT career has beaten every opponent put in front of him with his patented Black Mass spinning heel kick. A few weeks ago, Hideo Itami put himself in front of Black, interrupting what was supposed to be the start of a match, and Black knocked him out cold before going on to wrestle like nothing happened. That's lead to multiple confrontations, and now the Japanese star whose career is slipping by is set to confront the explosively talented and unbeaten Dutchman in a battle to see who has the more lethal striking ability -- and don't be surprised if the winner of this match has an NXT Championship title shot very soon.\n\nAll in all, this edition of NXT Takover: Brooklyn looks set to be every bit as big and spectacular as the last two times WWE's developmental brand came to the Barclays Center. NXT stole the show in each of those two SummerSlam weekends -- hopefully they can make it three in a row with another spectacular night of wrestling on Saturday.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T15:09:00Z",

Johnny Gargano via pinfall: Talk about a physical and high-energy match to get the Brooklyn crowd going wild early. Did I mention physical? Gargano's aerial tactics were perfectly complimented by Almas' stiff strikes throughout. The two put on a fun sequence of near falls late in the match that had the crowd on its feet. After Gargano kicked out of Almas' running knee finisher into the corner, he countered by launching Almas face first into the second turnbuckle. But just as Gargano went for the finish, Almas' manager, Zelina Vega, perfectly distracted him by tossing a #DIY T-shirt at his chest. Gargano's momentary lapse of attention gave Almas an opportunity to take him down and hit the La Sombra hammerlock DDT for the 1-2-3. Grade: B+\n\nIn the skybox -- Kurt Angle and Daniel Bryan: The general managers of Raw and SmackDown Live were shown hanging out with some NXT superstars not on the TakeOver show.

Here are some submitted Highlights\n\nEVOLVE's Gabe Sapolsky is apparently working with the NXT Creative Team:\n\n\"He's fantastic. He thinks so far ahead. He always just gets me. ...He's in NXT now. He's able to help me out. Gabe is able to say 'Hey, if we give you a mic in the ring, that's like a stronger area for a guy who really wasn't a promo guy before.'\"\n\nDrew thinks his first TakeOver, Brooklyn III will be better than SummerSlam:\n\n\"NXT TakeOver, is only four times a year, they're always a spectacle, everyone busts their ass. And we've got like a silent competition, I'll say it. SummerSlam is the next day. ...We wanna top SummerSlam. We're gonna top SummerSlam.\"\n\nWhat he thinks about old buddy and 3MB cohort Jinder Mahal winning the WWE Championship:\n\n\"I was there that night in Chicago. The pre-show for NXT the night before, I stayed for the PPV the next day. I didn't want to know the results, and I told both of them [Jinder Mahal] and Randy [Orton] don't tell me, I'll watch from the crowd. And when he won, most of the NXT roster were heading to the bus, and I sprinted off like the Ultimate Warrior, straight to 'gorilla.' I was right there waiting for him and I'm busting a 3MB air guitar.\"\n\nHe wants to be the \"John Cena of NXT\":\n\n\"Just think of me as your John Cena of NXT. If there is something going on and someone doesn't want to do it, then I'm your guy. I'm doing this, I'm happy. It's nothing fake, I generally do enjoy this.\"\n\nWhy he'd rather be on NXT instead of Raw or SmackDown:\n\n\"Just the buzz in the locker room, just the way the shows are put together. How much your opinion is valued. It's a team effort, and that's how it feels just one big team effort. I didn't want to be on Raw or SmackDown, I said that publicly before. I wanted to be a part of NXT, and [Triple H] bringing me into his baby, wanting me to be a part of it is such a huge honor.\"\n\nWhat it's like working with Shawn Michaels at the Performance Center:\n\n\"It's not something I've spoken about publicly yet, but Shawn Michaels teaches pro wrestling at the Performance Center. And when I came in with the contract I have, I don't technically have to be there. I mean, I'm fortunate with the deal I have, but then you've got that opportunity you're in that position then it's up to you. You know, whether you want to sit on your ass or you have the opportunity to work with the best in-ring wrestler of all time. It is literally like studying for your Ph.D. in wrestling.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T22:00:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367206", "time": "22:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "206540", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 4}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 1}, {"id": "307750", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Microphone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone", "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 4}, {"id": "315018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Roode"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Roode", "score": 3}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 2}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 2}, {"id": "340541", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shawn Michaels"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Michaels", "score": 2}, {"id": "340544", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Warrior (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_(wrestler)", "score": 2}, {"id": "340551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "score": 3}, {"id": "340566", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heavyweight_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 3}, {"id": "340568", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "score": 3}, {"id": "425728", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Evolve (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolve_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "426499", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jinder Mahal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinder_Mahal", "score": 4}, {"id": "523478", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Heath Slater"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath_Slater", "score": 3}, {"id": "537916", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Sean Waltman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Waltman", "score": 4}, {"id": "609391", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Air guitar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_guitar", "score": 2}, {"id": "614998", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "score": 4}, {"id": "744376", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Gabe Sapolsky"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Sapolsky", "score": 3}, {"id": "760571", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Pac (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac_(wrestler)", "score": 4}, {"id": "1271586", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT TakeOver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_TakeOver", "score": 4}, {"id": "1273130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT (TV series)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT_(TV_series)", "score": 2}], "image": "https://www.fightful.com/sites/default/files/video_embed_field_thumbnails/youtube/4k9OBlSVIVs.jpg", "timeCrawl": "10:48:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Drew McIntyre Proclaims Himself \"The John Cena Of NXT,\" Says Gabe Sapolsky Is Helping With Creative", "originalArticle": null}

This third edition of the show was no different, and it may even have been NXT's best Brooklyn show yet.\n\nWe saw two huge title changes, an even more shocking declaration of intent, and five top-shelf matches, including one of the best women's wrestling matches you'll ever see. It was a tremendous night for wrestling fans, and one that will be long and fondly remembered.\n\nDrew McIntyre has had one thing on his mind ever since re-signing with WWE and joining the NXT roster at WrestleMania weekend earlier this year: winning the NXT championship. On Saturday, he finally got his chance to do just that, finally getting his hands on NXT Champion Bobby Roode.\n\nAnd when he got his hands on Roode, he did his best to give the long-time champion the beating of his life, but Roode's ring smarts and sheer skill kept him alive for a long time, repeatedly turning the tables on the huge Scotsman. He used every tool in his arsenal against McIntye, using the ropes and the champion's advantage rules to stay alive when he was in trouble, and using his pure ability in the ring to hurt McIntyre at every opportunity.\n\nIn fact, Roode had McIntyre on the ropes, hitting a Glorious DDT that nearly won him the match, then hitting another right after his challenger kicked out -- but instead of going for the cover, he picked McIntyre up to hit another Glorious DDT. McIntyre struck back before Roode could lift him all the way up, knocking the champion senseless to set up his patented Claymore kick and finally winning himself the NXT Championship.\n\nEmber Moon has held a massive grudge against Asuka ever since the NXT Women's Champion cheated to beat her at NXT Orlando, then put her out of action and onto the injured list. So it was no surprise when she came absolutely flying out of the gates as soon as the bell rang, taking the match to Asuka and leaving the undefeated champion reeling.\n\nAsuka regained control, though, and started working over the recently-healed left shoulder of Moon, putting her challenger through a series of agonizing submission holds to try and break her will. All that did was anger Moon, though, who responded by fighting her way up with Asuka on her shoulders, and hitting a rarely-seen teardrop suplex to flatten the champion and take control for herself.\n\nThat control was short-lived, though, when a sudden German suplex from Asuka bounced Moon's head off the bottom turnbuckle in the far corner, setting her up for the Asuka Lock submission move. Moon was able to fight out of Asuka's first two tries to put her away, and even tried to get Asuka with her own move at one point, but the champion worked over her left arm some more before going back to the Asuka Lock. Moon broke it by forcing Asuka's shoulders down, and that started a back and forth, wide open stretch of the match that saw both women struggle to take full control of the proceedings.\n\nEmber Moon finally managed to get the upper hand, though, and looked like she had the match won when she finally managed to hit her Eclipse move, a corkscrew stunner that's taken out every other opponent she's faced. Asuka somehow kicked out, though, then used the referee to block Moon's second attempt. Moon kept pushing for the pinfall, but a crucial mistake let Asuka get her deep in the Asuka Lock, giving Moon no choice but to tap out, leaving Asuka still undefeated and still the NXT Women's Champion.\n\nAleister Black has carved an incredible path through NXT since his debut a few weeks ago, using his intimidating Black Mass spinning heel kick to beat everyone that's stepped in front of him -- and to knock out Hideo Itami when the frustrated Japanese star refused to leave the ring when Black was due to have a match several weeks ago.\n\nThat moment set up tonight's clash, and it was a brutal and hard-fought match between two elite strikers, with Black spending much of the match bleeding after an early exchange left his nose bloodied. He didn't let that slow him down one bit, however, coming back with responses to everything that Itami threw at him -- and Itami threw a lot of offense Black's way.\n\nIn fact, at one point it looked as though Itami had the upper hand and had Black all but beaten, especially after a Michinoku driver off the top rope followed soon after by a Falcon Arrow. That set Black up for Itami's Go To Sleep finisher, but Black had just enough left in the tank to fight out of it and start landing shots of his own -- shots that culminated in the Black Mass, leaving Itami unconscious on the mat once more, and leaving Black victorious once more, and with little left for him to do in NXT but challenge for the NXT Championship.\n\nThe NXT Tag Team Championship match pitted two teams of absolute monsters against each other, with the cold calculation of Paul Ellering's Authors of Pain defending their titles against the psychotic manipulation of Eric Young's Sanity. Akam and Rezar wasted no time in assaulting their challengers, starting a brawl that took a long time to sort out before the bell could even ring to start the match.\n\nYoung had a big surprise up his sleeve, though: when the match finally did start, he stepped into the match instead of Killian Dane. Dane and Alexander Wolfe had been brawling with the Authors for weeks, with Young completely absent until helping his allies jump the champions last week. Ellering would have had his men preparing to face Dane and Wolfe, so Young coming into the match threw a big spanner in the works.\n\nThe Authors still dominated much of the early going of the match, isolating the much smaller Young and working him over -- but when he finally got a tag in to Wolfe, the wild German madman completely changed the complexion of the match for a brief spell, suplexing both of the bigger Authors and nearly winning the match on his own before the champions took control again.\n\nThe numbers game got the best of the Authors, though, with Nikki Cross keeping them from executing a two-man superplex on Young by holding his leg, giving Sanity the chance to work their way back into the match after Akam accidentally power bombed Rezar on his own instead of sending Young down with him as intended. Their numbers came into play again, with Cross diving off the top rope, only to get caught by Akam -- who was promptly put through a table by an on-rushing Killian Dane while the referee was distracted.\n\nThat opening was all Young and Wolfe needed to work over Rezar, and one flying elbow from Young later, Sanity were the tag team champions in shocking fashoin.\n\nThe NXT universe has been buzzing with joy ever since Johnny Gargano returned to action, coming back from the beating he suffered at the hands of his former #DIY tag team partner Tommaso Ciampa after losing their match against the Authors of Pain at Takover: Chicago. But on Saturday night, it was Andrade \"Cien\" Almas earning himself the right to party with a big win over the fan favorite.\n\nThe two went back and forth trading absolutely huge moments -- a whiplasah DDT wasn't enough for Gargano to put Almas away, a huge tornado DDT couldn't keep Gargano down, Almas had to fight to get out of the Gargano Escape submission, a buckle bomb and bronco buster weren't enough to stop Gargano, and on and on it went.\n\nIn the end, it was Almas' manager Zelina Vega who made the difference, interrupting Gargano's efforts to set up his finisher on a downed Almas by throwing a DIY shirt in his face. Gargano recoiled when he saw what was on the shirt -- straight into a stiff shot from Almas, setting him up for a hammerlock DDT. It was a much-needed win for Almas, and a sign of a bright future for the young Mexican star at long, long last.\n\nThere were two big celebrations tonight, when Sanity and later Drew McIntyre both won their respective title matches -- but none of those proud men were able to celebrate for long. That's because Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly, two recent NXT debutantes, interrupted Sanity's celebration with a massive beating -- then coming out to face down McIntyre, setting him up for a shocking attack from Adam Cole.\n\nFish and O'Reilly came out of the crowd to attack them, uniting for the first time in NXT as reDRagon, one of the more decorated tag teams outside of the WWE in the last several years. They cleaned house on Sanity and the Authors of Pain, making a major statement of intent to the entire NXT Universe, one followed up loudly by their assist for Cole, who has been one of the most highly-decorated singles wrestlers in recent years, including a wildly successful stint with the Bullet Club.\n\nIt's clear that Cole and reDRagon see themselves as a force to be reckoned with in NXT. Cole has set his sights on McIntyre's NXT Championship, and it appears that Fish and O'Reilly are ready to square off with Sanity for the Tag Team Championships. They're ready to change the landscape of NXT -- and it's going to be fascinating to see just what they have in mind.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:39:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

Matches and moments which Bobby Roode admits means the current roster have a lot to live up to.\n\n\"It's a big pressure, but there's pressure everyday on NXT to go out there and perform\". Roode told Gorilla Position at last night's WWE 2K18 launch party.\n\n\"We're seen as a third brand and we want to make sure we are equal to the Raw's and SmackDown Live's. There's a lot of pride and a lot of passion in that locker-room and we're looking forward to the event and it's really going to set the bar pretty high for those guys on Sunday.\"\n\nOn a card that features Ember Moon challenging Asuka for the NXT Women's Title and Aleister Black's mouth-watering encounter with Hideo Itami, it's the main event all eyes will be on, as Roode defends against Drew McIntyre. An opponent that presents different problems than the Glorious one's previous title challengers.\n\n\"Drew's tough and physically he's the biggest test I've ever had. Shinsuke was very unique, Hideo was very unique, Roderick Strong was young and intense, but Drew is 6'6, 280 pounds, athletic and has youth on his side. I'm going to go out there and do what I've done for the last eight months as champion, and that's outsmart my opponents, use my ability and experience to outsmart my opponent and see what happens.\"\n\nCheck out the full video as Bobby talks changing the face of NXT and a possible main roster call-up in the future.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T21:53:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373927", "time": "21:53:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "218049", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 3}, {"id": "315018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Roode"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Roode", "score": 3}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 3}, {"id": "326957", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "score": 3}, {"id": "328739", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tag team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team", "score": 3}, {"id": "331120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "score": 4}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "score": 3}, {"id": "386419", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mercedes KV"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_KV", "score": 3}, {"id": "386420", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bayley (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayley_(wrestler)", "score": 3}, {"id": "448339", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Women's Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Women's_Championship", "score": 2}, {"id": "479958", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kenta Kobayashi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenta_Kobayashi", "score": 2}, {"id": "614998", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "score": 2}, {"id": "621757", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Roderick Strong"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roderick_Strong", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271586", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT TakeOver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_TakeOver", "score": 4}, {"id": "1273200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Revival (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revival_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "1275615", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Finn B\u00e1lor"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_B\u00e1lor", "score": 3}], "image": "https://talksport.com/sites/default/files/field/image/201708/bobby_roode_bio-dc4b8dac0de3c9e3fa7358e5b7ec1ed7.jpg", "timeCrawl": "21:53:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "'There's pressure every day on NXT' says Bobby Roode", "originalArticle": null}

Highlights are below:\n\nOn his match against Bobby Rhoode at NXT Takeover: Brooklyn III: \"This is what, pretty much, my entire career has led to. So, no pressure. The 17 years, the 10 years of being in America, the past three years of building my brand and my return back home. It's the biggest match of my life and I can say 100 percent I am ready for this. I'm excited to steal the show and have people talking about this match for a long time.\"\n\nOn Vince McMahon calling him the \"Chosen One\" in his first run with WWE: \"He saw something in me when I was younger that I didn't necessarily see myself and maybe others didn't see which is a pretty cool feeling. And finally, years later, after all the things I've been through and growing up, I think, finally, now it's starting to materialize and everyone is starting to see what he saw back in the day. He had that kind of faith in me and saw something in me that he was willing to endorse me in that way and perhaps it just took a minute and took a few life experiences to actually bring out what he saw.\"\n\nOn getting called by Triple H to come to NXT: \"After I got off the phone with him, one, I was very honored that he wanted me to be part of his baby in NXT and two, my mind was made up. I knew I had to be in NXT. I knew that was the next step for me and my family. And walking in the door, seeing all the faces that I knew and faces that I didn't know that I wanted to work with, I thought, wow, this is going to be something.

Here's when it starts.\n\nSummerSlam has become an entire weekend in the WWE Universe, and one of WWE's biggest stretches of the year will start with a fan-favorite: NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III on Saturday night.\n\nAfter the insane card put on last year, with Samoa Joe battling Shinsuke Nakamura for the NXT title and The Revival going up against DIY for the NXT tag titles, there's a lot to live up to this year for the \"developmental\" brand. While it's not as loaded of a card, this year is still incredibly promising, especially with the main event.\n\nIt's not anything like Joe and Nakamura, but this year's main event features NXT champion Bobby Roode defending his belt against Drew McIntyre on Saturday night in what is sure to be a solid matchup to get the crowd hot for what's to come on Sunday night. Meanwhile, Asuka will defend the women's title against Ember Moon, and The Authors of Pain will defend the tag titles against SAnitY.\n\nFans definitely won't watch to miss the action on the WWE Network on Saturday, so you'll want to mark the start time for the event in your phone or on your calendar (if you're into that physical paper calendar stuff) as soon as possible. The event starts at 8 p.m., with a pre-show starting at 7 p.m. for fans who are looking to add an extra hour to their TakeOver night on Saturday.\n\nIt's the perfect solution for fans looking to get a whole long weekend full of wrestling, so be sure to tune in on the WWE Network for the third installment of one of Brooklyn's biggest attractions over the last three years.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:10:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.686274528503418, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373927", "time": "12:10:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 3}, {"id": "315018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Roode"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Roode", "score": 2}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 3}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332492", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "score": 5}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 3}, {"id": "343955", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE Network"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Network", "score": 2}, {"id": "383369", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Tag Team Championship (WWE)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tag_Team_Championship_(WWE)", "score": 3}, {"id": "383378", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Championship", "score": 2}, {"id": "614998", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271586", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT TakeOver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_TakeOver", "score": 3}], "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?&url=https://fansided.com/files/2017/08/brooklyn3.jpg", "timeCrawl": "15:49:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "What time does NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III start?", "originalArticle": null}

What people will accept changes? What people will like changes?\n\n\"People's styles that I bring in, I'm not trying to change these performers, I'm trying to give them a platform and then take them on that platform and make the biggest, global star you can make.

Here's what to expect.\n\nGeneral Manager William Regal did his level best to build toward this weekend's NXT championship match when he brought out champ Bobby Roode and challenger Drew McIntyre for conversation last Wednesday. The two did get a chance to run each other down, as is standard in combat sports (entertainment), and present competing visions for the future of the brand, as is standard for NXT. Thanks in part to Roode's personal security team, we even managed to avoid a fight!\n\nBut it wasn't all smooth sailing for Regal, as Roderick Strong appeared to once again insist on a chance to avenge his and his family's honor. The Glorious One not only beat Strong in the ring, but he ran down Roddy, his fiancee and son every chance he got. The GM tried to keep the focus on McIntyre's bout in Brooklyn, but all three wrestlers agreed to the champion's plan - and the fans loved it - so management's hands were tied.\n\nSo tonight, it'll be Strong vs. McIntyre. If Roddy wins, he gets a match against Roode after TakeOver, a show the #1 contender heads into with a fresh loss. If Drew wins, he's got some momentum, and the Messiah of the Backbreaker is stuck on the outside of the main event scene looking in.\n\nPretty interesting for a 'go home' show.\n\nMr. Regal will try to go two-for-two in terms of keeping the peace during talking segments when he brings out Women's champ Asuka and Ember Moon for a contract signing. Last time these two were in the ring together, the undefeated Empress of Tomorrow was left laying following an Eclipse from the challenger. This isn't the titleholder's first contract signing though, and she's undoubtedly looking for a psychological edge heading into Barclays Center.\n\nSpeaking of mid games, Eric Young's SAnitY stable has been playing them with tag titleholders Authors of Pain - and last week they upped the ante and got physical, tying Rezar to a barricade while they brutalized Akam in the ring, then punishing them both once the self-proclaimed Albanian Psycho freed himself. Will Paul Ellering be able to help his squad regain the upper-hand heading into their defense against Alexander Wolfe and Killian Dain on Saturday?\n\n- Look for a lot of interviews and recaps to build for this weekend's show, especially in the non-title matches, where Regal only recently added Johnny Gargano vs. Andrade \"Cien\" Almas and Aleister Black vs. Hideo Itami.

And finally, years later, after all the things I've been through and growing up, I think, finally, now it's starting to materialize and everyone is starting to see what he saw back in the day. He had that kind of faith in me and saw something in me that he was willing to endorse me in that way and perhaps it just took a minute and took a few life experiences to actually bring out what he saw.\"\n\n\"After I got off the phone with him, one, I was very honored that he wanted me to be part of his baby in NXT and two, my mind was made up. I knew I had to be in NXT. I knew that was the next step for me and my family. And walking in the door, seeing all the faces that I knew and faces that I didn't know that I wanted to work with, I thought, wow, this is going to be something.

The general consensus of you not being most popular is harsh at times but also can be well-founded too. But I still read your stuff because I do enjoy your articles and find your perspective interesting most of the time.\"\n\n\"That said, your article about your friend Megan and trip to Wrestlemnaia was the greatest thing you have ever wrote. Forget about the predictions you brag about getting right. This is your crowning piece. Maybe it is because I can relate as going to Wrestlemania is my ultimate dream and it will be happening next year. But I genuinely loved your article.\"\n\nPretty big week ahead for all of us. Besides the fact I am staring down at yet another 50 hours at work, there is also this little thing called WWE Summerslam. Arguably the biggest wrestling show of the year next to WrestleMania. On top of that is the best NXT card possible for their latest Brooklyn Takeover live special on the WWE Network. Both look solid and while we can complain about the length of Sunday's show, I am looking forward to both. Since my predictions won't be made public until this weekend, why not compare and contrast each event.\n\nWhich Is Better: WWE Summerslam 2017 OR NXT Brooklyn III?\n\nMain event for Summerslam - I'd make the case for Shinsuke Nakamura vs. Jinder Mahal ending the evening provided a new champion is crowned. Still, there is no doubt that the true headlining act is for the Universal Championship. Brock Lesnar defends against Roman Reigns, Samoa Joe, and Braun Strowman. A rare fatal four way for The Beast in his WWE career. The added stipulation made by Paul Heyman is should Lesnar lose he will leave the company, hinting at all the UFC rumors out there. Honestly, RAW numbers are up and while you can point at carious factors, this is the big selling point. It is only fair to see these four and realize fans are drawn in right now. I'd prefer a one on one Brock/Braun bout as teased the night after WM33. However, this works just fine to protect all four...and keep the title in place.\n\nMain event for NXT Brooklyn - Drew McIntyre has been on fire since re-appearing. Bobby Roode has been NXT Champions since January. Both have been kept strong. Both men have a stellar win-loss record. Both men are exact reasons why NXT gets praised so much. They know how to let their talents shine and NOT get dragged down by pointless losses on the weekly shows. Drew and Bobby are on a legitimate collision course where you can't imagine either man losing. Smart money is on a new champ with the loser slowly transitioning to the main roster...but would that be glorious? We'll see.\n\nVERDICT: In terms of unpredictability (for those who love that), NXT gets the nod. In terms of hype and build, WWE wins easily. RAW has delivered the goods in recent weeks, and I expect more of the same on Sunday.\n\nTag Team Titles at Summerslam - On the RAW side, you have a yet to be announced match brewing between Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose vs. Sheamus and Cesaro. On the Smackdown side, you have the 476th match between The New Day and The Usos. Eh, I love the teases of a reunion for The Shield, although my prediction all along has been Dean ends up turning on Seth...down the road. The New Day and Usos is just an excuse to give new champs a title defense. Fairly disappointing. Outside of the entire thing with the former Shield members, the tag scenes are hurting without The Revival (hurt), Hardyz (waiting to be woken up), Big Cass and Enzo separated, Breezango still playing dress up, and American Alpha ending in a splat.\n\nTag Titles at NXT Brooklyn - Feels a little rushed. Still, The Authors of Pain vs. Sanity is what's left of the NXT tag team division. I have no issues with this heel/heel showdown. My belief is Sanity is finishing up with NXT anyways, having never truly taken off. Might as well have a big brawl with the giant unstoppable monsters before exiting for the main roster.\n\nVERDICT: Believe it or not, NXT wins here. All three feuds have had clunky story lines in July and August, so the favorite goes to the fresher bout. That is AOP and Sanity.\n\nWomens Title match at Summerslam - The RAW side will either be Nia Jax vs. Alexa Bliss (ugh) or Sasha Banks vs. Alexa Bliss (again). The blue brand is featuring Naomi versus Natalya, which just feels like a backdrop to Carmella cashing in her Money in the Bank briefcase. Not exactly what I would call Summerslam worthy matches. Sasha Banks as a heel taking on a struggling Bayley - that is money. Jax as an unbeatable monster against a scared Bliss - that is money...except Jax tends to lose more than she should and has been kinda/sorta buddies with the champ. None of this really makes sense. Now to be fair, Bayley getting injured came at the worst possible time ever, so they do get a bit of a pass. Smackdown LIVE has no excuse though. Becky Lynch is doing nothing. Charlotte is doing nothing. Heck, I don't even care too much for Naomi, but it definitely comes across as her just 'holding' the belt for Carmella.\n\nWomens Title match at NXT Brooklyn - The exact match that should be happening. Asuka as the undefeated dominant champion going up against her biggest challenger and the one person she had to cheat in order to defeat in their prior meeting. A lot of folks do not think Ember Moon is the wrestler to dethrone Asuka. I think she is. Minus a Mae Young Classic winner coming in to confront the newly heel Asuka in a few months, nobody else fits the mold. Moon does perfectly. She has all the momentum she needs right now to beat Asuka and start a new era in the NXT women's division. It is time. Asuka can lose on Saturday, lose in a rematch and then lose to a new signee/Mae Young Classic winner before heading up to Raw or Smackdown in 2018.\n\nVERDICT: NXT takes it again. Asuka/Moon is the biggest bout the division can deliver. Naomi/Nattie and Bliss/Jax or Bliss/Banks is not. Easy decision here.\n\nBest of the rest - I am not even going to debate this section. Summerslam is six hours long when you add in the Kickoff Show. NXT Takeover Brooklyn is nowhere near that length. Thus, it is a bit unfair to even imagine how different the cards would be without that reversed. There is just too many stacked performers on the main roster.\n\nJohn Cena vs. Baron Corin, Jinder Mahal vs. Shinsuke Nakamura for the WWE Championship, Big Show vs. Big Cass, Bray Wyatt vs. Finn Balor, Randy Orton vs. Rusev, AJ Styles vs. Kevin Owens, and Neville vs. Akira Tozawa...\n\n...or...\n\nAleister Black vs. Hideo Itami and Johnny Gargano vs. Andrade Almas?\n\nCome on. The six hour show may seem like a marathon on paper, but those matches all look fairly solid. Where NXT Takeover Brooklyn has the more intriguing and less predictable main matches (as noted above), the best of the rest belongs to WWE Summerslam by a landslide. So much potential there.\n\nOVERALL SUMMARY: You tell me. Which card looks better heading into the weekend? Is it WWE Summerslam or NXT Takeover Brooklyn?\n\nNRW: The Match\n\nNow over 1,300 views.

I think most of us figured out that plot point a while ago, but Moon needs practice on the microphone. She did well explaining the story and a decent job of conveying her emotional resolve, so...\n\nFar from essential, especially if you watch every week, but production can use it for Kickoff show video packages on Saturday. And Asuka yelling in Japanese is always worth my time.\n\nWhile I'm excited for the match itself, the story and Moon's character don't rise to the level they should - especially if they put Ember over in Brooklyn. They've built beyond the Eclipse, which is good, but that still doesn't feel like enough considering Asuka's place as an all-time NXT great enshrined in the WWE history books.\n\nBut, hey, General Manager William Regal was able to keep the peace for once!\n\nAfter a week to process my reaction to the Street Profits (and thank goodness nothing else was going which would make anyone reflect about race and their response to it, right?), I'm down with Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins. Really, the only reason I wasn't from the start was my own insecurity about being a middle-aged white guy who says he's \"down with\" things, so seeing middle-aged white guys with red cups and fake gold chains in the Full Sail crowd made me much more uncomforable than anything the Profits were doing. Anyway... thank you for indulging me as I stare into the abyss.\n\nA second helping of Ford and Dawkins definitely cemented my belief that Montez is the star of the group. That's also because we've seen Angelo in three or four gimmicks before this one, but there's a reason none of them stuck. Ford's high-pitched laugh/scream and run through the crowd after his partner decked Silvio might have been my favorite thing on the whole episode.\n\nAlso liked everything about the Sullivan angle, starting with how we joined Regal's Led Zeppelin tour anecdote mid-story, all the way through Lars' clever way to keep his promise to his boss. Hopefully its inclusion on this 'go home' episode means the pace of the story will pick up after Brooklyn, because how infrequently we've visited it is really my only complaint. That, and that at some point we need to know if Sullivan can wrestle, or if he just looks scary.\n\nLooks like Peyton vs. Ruby will be our filmed-pre-TakeOver-shown-post-TakeOver match, for Brooklyn III. And... yeah.\n\nI like all three of these wrestlers, but despite getting a little less than four minutes and giving both Riot and Kay some offense, this did little to nothing for me. Doesn't help that the Iconic Duo are the NXT equivalent of Bray Wyatt, only with mean girl insults instead of bayou prophesy, so there was little suspense about who was winning here, and less about who will win their mini-program.\n\nDecent enough video package, but mostly, I'm shocked no time was spent building Hideo Itami vs. Aleister Black or especially Johnny Gargano vs. Andrade \"Cien\" Almas.\n\nAt least the former established some heat in the one week of set-up it received. The latter is actually just a babyface saying \"I want on the card\", a heel (or, in this case, his associate) saying \"I'll face you\", and management saying \"deal!\" Even something as simple as Zelina Vega and Almas interrupting an interview with Johnny Wrestling could have done a lot. Their match has the potential to be a show-stealer, but they shouldn't rest on that.\n\nRoddy is an amazing pro wrestler. The way he smoothly integrates speed and power moves, regardless of who he's working with, is special. His verbal and acting abilities aren't to the same high level, but NXT's done a really good job of giving us enough outside-the-ring reasons to cheer him when he's in the ring.\n\nHe's got great chemistry with McIntyre, too. This was very much of a piece with the NXT Strong Style (a term I won't stop trying to make happen) bouts like Danny Burch/Oney Lorcan we've been getting since Orlando. The sounds they were able to make on some of the knee strikes and head butts were impressive by themselves. I'd definitely be interested in seeing more of this rivalry down the road.\n\nAnd yet, the whole thing seemed a little disappointing once the run-in we all knew was coming happened.\n\nEven that was well-executed, although if you don't love the champ's megalomaniacal dickhead routine as much as I do, it might not have been as satisfying. But it was telegraphed in a way I expect from the main roster - not NXT. And to make matters worse, there was no follow-up.\n\nMaybe I'm just bitter because I waited to write this expecting to see a Triple Threat announcement (which I shouldn't have expected, since Regal was clear that was never an option), but I'd like some resolution.\n\nStrong should get his rematch with Roode after TakeOver. It'll have more heat, and if \"reverse momentum theory\" holds it'll need it, since then it would be non-title. Drew will have the deck stacked a little higher against him because of how beat up he got, as Mauro Ranallo and crew kept reminding us, \"just 72 hours\" before Brooklyn.\n\nIt all makes serves the story, so maybe I got worked because now there's a new layer to Saturday's match and I'm even more interested in seeing Drew and Roddy finish what they started?\n\nCould be, but I'm still disappointed.\n\nBetter than the worst of 2016's pre-TakeOver shows, but still a frustrating mix of filler and padding. The main event delivered the best action and raised the stakes for this weekend, yet still failed to satisfy.\n\nLuckily, if they deliver as usual on the 19th, this will all be forgiven.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T05:00:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367206", "time": "05:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "303484", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "score": 2}, {"id": "303817", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "score": 5}, {"id": "304095", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Moon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "score": 5}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "306411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "score": 2}, {"id": "306490", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Star"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star", "score": 3}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "309502", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bayou"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayou", "score": 2}, {"id": "315015", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Manager (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 3}, {"id": "324818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 2}, {"id": "325373", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Knee (strike)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee_(strike)", "score": 2}, {"id": "331294", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "score": 1}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332483", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Johnny Gargano"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Gargano", "score": 2}, {"id": "349175", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bray Wyatt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windham_Rotunda", "score": 2}, {"id": "370443", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ruby (programming language)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)", "score": 3}, {"id": "376129", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Led Zeppelin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin", "score": 3}, {"id": "383375", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "William Regal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Regal", "score": 3}, {"id": "448339", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Women's Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Women's_Championship", "score": 4}, {"id": "479958", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kenta Kobayashi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenta_Kobayashi", "score": 2}, {"id": "642680", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mauro Ranallo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauro_Ranallo", "score": 1}, {"id": "648611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Martin Stone (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Stone_(wrestler)", "score": 2}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGDoTjZzmBEVjfRZTrOpNlfa9nU=/0x0:1200x675/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56231701/DHY_ylsV0AAIL9a.0.jpg", "timeCrawl": "05:24:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "NXT recap & reactions: Don't want no problem", "originalArticle": null}

Here then are my idea of the twenty most likely moves, using internal logic (because they have to leave some guys behind), from WWE Network to USA Network in the very near future:\n\n1 Bobby Roode\n\nOf course writing these before the biggest Takeover of the year means a certain amount of having to second guess booking intentions, but surely Roode's time can't last much longer in NXT? He's 40, getting big pops at tour house shows despite his TV commitment to his heel craft, and there's a steady stream of faces, many with logical turning potential, to take the reins, especially if Adam Cole comes in as a heel.\n\n2 Asuka\n\nEmber Moon is beginning to look more like the potential legend killer and there's a tournament winner who might fancy a shot after mid-September, but equally the idea of her retaining, then going up anyway and via some means leaving the NXT title behind (as much as it'd be interpreted as torching the division in her wake) is growing in popularity and either brand could be sharpened up with a force of nature taking over. It should also be added that there's also never been a reliable rumor that she's set for promotion.\n\n3 SAnitY\n\nIt feels a little like their title shot this Saturday, with it being heel vs heel, is a thank you present from NXT - Eric Young's not getting any younger and Nikki Cross - no way she's keeping that first name on the main roster, of course - can add chaos to either divisions' heel stagnancy, and there's a logic to them being the Fashion Police's destructors. Only thought otherwise is that the Dusty Classic is upcoming and it seems ideal to develop the Dain/Wolfe team.\n\n4 Hideo Itami\n\nHe's been around so long that in storyline he brought Balor into NXT and before that the company played up his credentials as so great that even Hulk Hogan was impressed by him. A stop-start run has followed, as much by booking (the long Tyler Breeze feud) as by his injuries, and I wouldn't be surprised if after his heel turn they cut their losses and give him a couple of years on TV to fend off the inevitable Punk chants.\n\n5 Lars Sullivan\n\nSasha and KO were tweeting approvingly about him in 2014! He's rumored to have trained with Lesnar! The Lenny from Of Mice And Men thing he's got going on with tag partners is cute, but NXT hasn't traditionally had a singles hoss and this does feel a little like stalling trying to work out what to do with him. The admittedly far larger Braun Strowman, who deliberately only ever worked house shows for NXT, learnt on the job in the full spotlight glare and maybe the man with the infamously enormous hands could benefit likewise.\n\n6 Liv Morgan\n\nNo, really. There's a lot more deserving candidates, but when the face side on main roster house show loops are a woman down for their six-woman matches they often call for Morgan to fill the gap - she stood in for Charlotte, away on promotional duty, on last week's Smackdown weekend tour - because apparently singles matches or normal tags are anathema to the setup. She has a long way to go, but they like to give Performance Center graduates priority callups and there was a rocket face push at least attempted in NXT.\n\n7 Drew McIntyre\n\nWould more likely take over as the fulcrum of the NXT arena tour shows once Roode goes, and whichever brand he goes to he has a former 3MB colleague waiting for him so you wouldn't blame him for stopping behind, but it's that recognizability factor that may end up working for him.\n\n8 Authors Of Pain\n\nA monster aura the tag divisions haven't seen for a while, bankable presence especially in these days where the hoss is becoming big business again, known quantity manager for retro appeal. Imagine them powerbombing the Hardys or New Day onto the ramp as Ellering rubs his hands together in the background.\n\n9 Mandy Rose\n\nHer Total Divas stint maybe didn't help and it feels a long time ago now, but she's got to have been off television since last October for a reason - she wasn't even in the #1 contender battle royal - and word is she's a lot better than her reputation might suggest.\n\n10 Peyton Royce & Billie Kay\n\nCould the Iconic Duo benefit more from being the Antipodean Laycool than their jobber to the stars status? Royce is a great worker, Kay on previous evidence should kill it when the split comes and she turns face, and as far as NXT TV goes they may already be past the point of being taken seriously against Ember or whoever unseats Asuka.\n\n11 No Way Jose\n\nSeems to have hit a ceiling for now and the dancing is readymade for a mid-card role.\n\n12 Kassius Ohno\n\nThree Takeovers will soon have passed since he returned in a blaze of publicity and his only role in them has been as a late replacement in an eight-person tag match. With Sheamus due to take movie-making time off very soon, imagine if they split Sheasaro and reunited Cesaro with an old friend.\n\n13 Tian Bing\n\nWWE just announced a Network deal for China, and Bing appeared in the Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal at Wrestlemania 33, eliminating both of the Fashion Police. Hasn't appeared on TV since, but, well, you know what's at stake here.\n\n14 Babatunde Aiyegbusi\n\n6'9, 350lbs, former Minnesota Viking. Doesn't even have a ring name yet but as with Braun, if anyone's likely to be surprisingly fast-tracked to TV...\n\n15 Johnny Gargano\n\nYes, there's unfinished business as much with an old partner as establishing Johnny Wrestling as another ultimate underdog babyface, but when Ciampa is ready imagine the Owens-Zayn callup story in reverse and how impactful that could feel.\n\n16 Buddy Murphy\n\nDown to the wild swings now, but two years this weekend on from BAMF losing the tag titles by all accounts he's killing it as a face on the Floridian house show loop without getting anywhere near TV.\n\n17 Roderick Strong\n\nHas a story to see through to some kind of conclusion, but Cole's expected arrival might demonstrate there isn't room for both.\n\n18 Heavy Machinery\n\nThey did get that title shot very early in their run, and Otis Dozovic's lunatic charisma would spawn a million impersonators.\n\n19 Andrade 'Cien' Almas\n\nIf he loses at Takeover, don't be surprised if the act with Zelina Vega continues on the bigger stage while they think there's still Hispanic money in him.\n\n20 Jeet Rama\n\nWWE's other contracted Indian, hasn't been on TV yet but was accompanied by the

To say the NXT stars experienced a travel delay on their way to NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III is an understatement, to say the least.\n\nThe WWE Superstars of tomorrow had to endure a shocking thirteen-hour delay on their way to New York City. It was a rather trying time but at least it was a good opportunity for Adam Cole to bond with his new coworkers.\n\nThere's not a whole lot you can do at an airport when you're stuck there for thirteen hours. But thankfully we live in the modern-age with social media so the NXT stars and head coach Matt Bloom could update fans on the NXT roster's whereabouts.\n\nAs you can see, Johnny Gargano actually got pretty comfy in the airport. After so long waiting to board his flight he was under the impression that the NXT roster just lived at the airport now. Thankfully he had Billie Kay and Peyton Royce to remind him they were on their way to New York City.\n\nThey might have been cutting it close, but at least all of the guys and girls on the NXT roster got to New York City in one piece.

But if you're aware of Drew McIntyre and what he stands for, you'll have a pretty good sense of just how hard he had to work for his second chance in the WWE.\n\nThe current No. 1 contender for the NXT championship first debuted in the WWE almost 10 years ago at the age of 22. After a reset and some seasoning in WWE developmental, McIntyre returned to the WWE in 2009 and quickly picked up both an on-air endorsement from Vince McMahon as a future world champion and the moniker \"The Chosen One.\"\n\nHe showed flashes of greatness -- most notably during a lengthy Intercontinental title reign and a tag team title run with Cody Rhodes -- but by 2011 it was clear something just wasn't clicking. He switched brands several times and had a notable run as part of \"3MB\" with Jinder Mahal and Heath Slater, but in June 2014, McIntyre was released from the WWE.\n\nIt ended up being one of the best things that could have ever happened to McIntyre. But to get to the point where he is today, in the main event of Saturday's NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III show, he had to go back to his roots. He had to figure out who Drew Galloway was, and what he was meant to be.\n\nFrom the WWE's perspective, it wasn't goodbye. It was so long, for now.\n\n\"When he left,\" commented Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque, executive vice president of talent, live events and creative for WWE, \"much like Jinder [Mahal], there was a conversation where it was like, 'It's just not the right time. We tried, you tried. You need to go out, find yourself, find your maturity and continue to develop. Don't forget the things you learned here. Go out to other places, morph to them, and make them morph to you. Accept that role, and when the time is right, you'll be back here.'\"\n\nMcIntyre went off on his own but seemingly took those words to heart.\n\n\"You live inside the bubble so long, but I had to go away and kind of do things and be away from [my wrestling] home for the first time,\" said McIntyre during a recent interview with ESPN.com. \"I moved from home in Scotland to home in WWE, and that was the first time being out on my own in my life.\"\n\nMcIntyre started training in his teens and wrestled in the U.K. for five years before he signed his first WWE contract, but from the time he moved down to Florida, where he resides to this day, McIntyre rarely had the chance to get back.\n\nAs he returned to some of those promotions, and some new ones that had popped up over the previous decade in the U.K., McIntyre was able to make up for some lost time.\n\n\"It was pretty cool. That was one of the biggest things,\" said McIntyre. \"I didn't get home much at all during the eight-year period [I was with WWE]. Simply the nature of the business. I'd see family on the U.K. tours and when they came over here. But it was very difficult. That was the hardest thing, not seeing family, because I was very, very close to my family.\"\n\nWith an eye toward remaining as competitive and relevant in the wrestling world outside of the WWE, which meant a lot of events in the United States, McIntyre couldn't commit to moving back to the U.K. In order to make regular appearances on both sides of the Atlantic, McIntyre had to commit to a travel schedule that saw him rack up an impressive number of frequent-flyer miles.\n\n\"For the past few years, I was basically back and forth every three weeks for about two and a half years straight, if you can imagine, between the U.K. and St. Petersburg, Florida, where I live,\" said McIntyre. \"It was pretty wild, the travel schedule I kept. I don't know how my wife is still with me after everything, just how hard I was pushing and how much I was traveling. I was the busiest wrestler in the world.\"\n\nMcIntyre's rigorous schedule, at different points in his three-year WWE hiatus, had him working for EVOLVE, Impact Wrestling and a variety of other independents in the United States, as well as ICW, WhatCulture Pro Wrestling, OTT and a number of other European companies. He got to face the best performers in the world night after night and learn the responsibilities of being a main attraction.\n\n\"The coolest thing was, I really got all of that battle time. I got that ring time, and I got to grow up a lot,\" said McIntyre. \"There's so much more to being a 'top guy' than what you see on screen that I really learned. I evolved as a performer. I evolved as a man. And I come back ready to lead a company.\"\n\nMcIntyre became a central figure in the world of independent wrestling at a time when business witnessed a major uptick. With the evolution of the distribution systems for pro wrestling, including a number of new streaming networks and far better promotion via social media, companies that put out great content could make stars and bring in huge crowds unlike anything they'd ever seen before.\n\n\"I watched the houses grow -- that became my focus,\" said McIntyre. \"For instance, ICW in Scotland. When I came back, we had 1,500 people at the show. Last November we broke the independent attendance record with 8,000. That was through the hard work of everybody, and it was a really cool feeling that I was giving back in the business.\"\n\nMcIntyre racked up a lot of gold over those three years, including the EVOLVE championship and tag team championship, the ICW heavyweight championship, the TNA championship and Impact Grand championship, and the WCPW world championship, to name a few. He helped to build an audience for each of the companies he worked for, and the wrestlers who worked opposite McIntyre were making names for themselves too.\n\nIt reached a point where it made sense to part ways, and the call from WWE couldn't have come at a better time.\n\n\"I don't think they necessarily needed Drew Galloway anymore. And it was time for Drew McIntyre to come back home and finish what I began.\"\n\nMcIntyre made a memorable return to the WWE fold at NXT TakeOver: Orlando, as he appeared in the crowd just prior to the main event between Bobby Roode and Shinsuke Nakamura. He was singularly focused on taking everything he'd learned over the course of his three years away and channeling it into bigger and better things this time around in WWE.\n\nBut a funny thing happened when he walked into the NXT locker room for the first time. McIntyre saw a lot of the wrestlers he'd spent the past three years going to war with.\n\n\"From the first minute of the first day I walked back in, I looked around the locker room at that TakeOver, and I was just laughing to see so many familiar faces,\" said McIntyre. \"And I thought, 'Wow, we're not going to have any trouble building back up and taking it higher than NXT's ever been.' Because I know these guys, I know how talented they are, and I know what we can do with this brand.\"\n\nThere are always dream opponents when you join a new company and people you'd prefer to keep your distance from. But as currently constructed, NXT's roster presents a dizzying array of possibility in terms of future opponents for McIntyre.\n\n\"I hate singling people out because it's literally everybody. You see guys like Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly coming into the company, which is awesome. Oney Lorcan, who I [already faced], you know I love that physical style. There's a bunch of us that have that physical style, which makes NXT so unique. Killian Dain and I had a chance to tango before, and we're going to do it again.\n\n\"I've been in companies where I'm like, 'Oh, god, I hope it's only this guy or this guy.' But it's literally, an entire roster of people. Roderick Strong, we've had some of my favorite battles. Aleister Black, we've battled in the past, across the world. I've enjoyed his build, to watch his evolution as well. We're doing our thing separately, just building up, and hopefully when we come together, it won't just be the good matches we've had, we'll have great matches. Basically, I'm just going to sum it up by saying this is why I love NXT. Our whole roster is so damn talented, I want to fight them all.\"\n\nFour months after making a grand entrance to NXT, McIntyre gets his first crack at the NXT championship against Roode, an opponent he's only faced a handful of times but who suits him well, stylistically speaking.\n\n\"The opportunity to give my first TakeOver on the biggest show of the year, against Bobby Roode for the title, you know, it's pretty incredible. But everything I've done and everything I've been through has prepared me for this moment, prepared me for this match.\"\n\n\"I feel like Drew has finally gotten to a place in his life where he's willing to work hard enough to be what he should have always been,\" said Levesque. \"He's had a look, he's had charisma, he's had talent, he's had all these things, but he'd be the first guy to tell you that it didn't work out the first time, for a lot of reasons.\"\n\nIt's the realization of a moment more than three years in the making or, if you're looking at the big picture of McIntyre's wrestling career, far longer.\n\n\"I set out with these short-term goals, and I hit them one at a time. What's about to happen is basically the biggest match I've ever had in 17 years of wrestling,\" said McIntyre. \"[I've spent] the past three years building myself up, building my brand, going out in the world, and now I'm returning back home.\"\n\nIt may not happen on Saturday, but it certainly seems as though the next wave of NXT champions could take over the mantle after such seemingly dominant stretches from Roode, Asuka and the Authors of Pain. That McIntyre could be on the precipice of such a key role in WWE speaks volumes as to how far he's come in just three years.\n\n\"Drew McIntyre is a stud. He works his butt off. He's here for everybody, not just himself, to put on the best performance for our fan base,\" said Levesque. \"I couldn't be happier for him and the spot he's in. He's really earned it.\"\n\nFor those who haven't followed McIntyre's career since he left WWE, the past few months have provided a window into just how exciting a competitor he's become. But given the stage he's about to take, it appears he's ready to blow the roof off of the Barclays Center with Roode at NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III.\n\n\"I promise, I will guarantee everybody an absolute spectacle. They'll be talking about this match for years. It's a perfect opponent and the perfect situation for me to come home.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T19:38:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 927, "textStart": 918, "date": "2014-06-", "amb": false}],

Here is a report from the call, courtesy of PWInsider.com...\n\nPaul \"Triple H\" Levesque met with reporters today on a conference call in advance of Saturday's NXT Takeover event.\n\nAdam Hopkins welcomed us to the call and turned it over to Paul.\n\nHe opened by thanking us for being the call. He is excited for the Barclay Center and Takeover as it's NXT's version of WrestleMania, where things finish up and then start again for next year. He is excited and they have a lot of things in store. The Mae Young Classic is on the docket today as well. He said it was an amazing experience.\n\nHe then put out his thoughts and prayers for Ric Flair. He is one of H's best friends, idol and mentor. It's been a rough week for him and his family. He said Ric is a fighter and he won't go down without a fight. He hopes to see him strutting down the aisle again real soon.\n\nThe first question came from Mike Johnson. Of course. Mike asked about Dave Prazak and Gabe Sapolsky working down at the Performance Center, as well as Progress Wrestling. Mike asked to clarify the relationships with NXT and WWE. He also asked if they have added to the creative process with NXT.\n\nH made a joke about the Progress guys being in Florida, as if he didn't know (which of course he did). He said that he wants to work with people that are in the business of cultivating talent, not people that are just interested in running shows. He said that there is an opportunity on both sides working with them. They can each learn from each other. And they can learn what WWE is looking for when they cultivate new talent for WWE in something of a feeder system. He said that Dave Prazak has been very supportive of women in the business and he thought it was important to bring him in. H said that he called him into a meeting to discuss something and Prazak was surprised that he would ask for his advice. All of that is important to H. He said that there was speculation about Gabe. He said he likes Gabe. He is a smart guy and when he has an opportunity to bring him and learn from him it's good for everybody. They aren't driving anything in particular but we will wait and see. He likes talent, wherever it comes from and he wants to work with people like that. They aren't officially employed by the company but it seems like them are more learning consultants.\n\nHe was asked how a young Triple H would do in NXT.\n\nHe talked about the opportunity is there and the slate is fresh when people come in. When people are in developmental you give them opportunities and it's up to them to make the most of it. It's a process where he has to gauge where people are and what they are ready for. You also need to be cognizant of how they workers are paired. It's a giant puzzle and they have to see where people fit.\n\nHe was asked if WWE and wrestling and general could have done more for the women's wrestler earlier?\n\nH said maybe but he just thinks that now is the right time for it. He said that at this point in time, women are getting to be the heroes in entertainment. Maybe that means that people are more ready now. All he knows is that the time is right for it now. People like it and are excited for it. He said when he came up with the idea he pitched it and took a while to get it accepted. He originally thought it would be 16 women but then he said that there were at least 32 he could use and it was hard to exclude people. He said that when they got to the tournament and he expected it to be good but he was blown away by how good it was. So was Shawn Michaels. Some of his people said they thought it was better than the Cruiser tournament. He said that these are all women that got into the business for the same reason he did, they saw wrestling as a youngster and thought it was great and wanted to do it. For the guys, there was always the pot of gold at the end but it didn't exist for the women. They went for the ride anyway. He said that it was even hard to find footage of some of them due to lack of opportunities. He hopes that little girls watch the tourney and they say they have to do it too. He is excited to show this to the world. He can't wait for them to see it.\n\nDave Meltzer asked about WWE releasing many episodes of the Mae Young at once.\n\nH said that the world is changing. His kids are 11, 9 and 7 and they don't get the concept of watching something at a specific time. He said it's an experiment to get the episodes out in a big way. You can watch the first round in a week, then watch the rest the next week. He thinks people will binge watch it and in a couple of weeks they will go to the live show in Vegas on 9/12. He is interested to see how the binge works.\n\nHe was asked about the final on the 12th. What is the plan?\n\nH said he isn't 100 percent sure yet. His intent is to make a big promotion around the final match, with a big build. He isn't sure how 205 Live will shake out that day. The logistics are being worked on.\n\nHe was asked how many of the women he thought that WWE would sign. Is there a plan for a Women's Only show?\n\nH said he would never say never. We could end of there. We are experimenting and watching how the world shifts and move. With the women, it could be different because they could send women to the three brands and beef up the rosters, plus the UK. He doesn't know that they need their own show. It might make it less than more.\n\nHe was asked about adding more Spanish wrestlers to WWE.\n\nH said that they are constantly looking and recruiting. They look everywhere but they don't always find it, but they are always working on it.\n\nHe was asked about bringing NXT to Spain.\n\nH said that at this point it just has to make sense logistically. They are trying to get there but nothing has been finalized yet.\n\nJim Varsallone mentioned that there are NXT alumnus all over the SummerSlam card. That means the system is working right?\n\nH said yes. Sure they take guys from other places but they have to teach them. But they have also created people like Braun Strowman, Baron Corbin, Nia Jax, Alexa Bliss and Charlotte. They are bringing them in and cultivating them. It's about 80% of the roster so the system is working as it should. It will never be everything he wants it to be, but that is because he has such high standards. They do all they can to make the talent succeed and then they need to go and do it. He is thrilled with the process and where they are.\n\nHe was asked about taking talent from the main roster and bringing the back to the Center. He talked about Jinder and how they always had faith in him. It didn't pan out when he got to the main roster. Drew McIntyre the same thing. They both left to figure some things out and come back ready, and they did. Sometimes guys need to go away and learn to come back and be better.\n\nOur last call came from Scott Fishman. He asked about the overall card for Saturday.\n\nThe premise of the show is kind of coming home and redemption. The first year in Brooklyn was the turning point for the brand. He talked about NXT alumni wanting to come on Saturday and be a part of it. It is kind of a homecoming for Drew McIntyre too. He mentioned Bobby Roode spending the year as pompous champion. Ember and Asuka are ready to go. He talked about the perseverance of Hideo Itami and his heel turn has been great. He put over Aleister Black and how cool he is. He is looking forward to Sanity vs. AOP. And finally Cien Almas and Johnny Gargano. He wants to see it. Can Andrade reinvent himself. Can Johnny start a singles run. And that doesn't even take into account all of the great talent that are not even on the show. NXT is the hotbed and place to be. This card is the finish of the season, on a high note, but we are also starting a new season in high gear.\n\nHe was asked what Vince McMahon says when they talk about it?\n\nH said that Vince is excited about. Some people he asks when he will get them. So he works with his team to get that person ready. There are a lot of things he has to get them ready for. When they talk they exchange what they see with each other. Sometimes that means he has to tell Vince he is protecting people, for instance, so Vince relies on H and his team. H wants it to be the best that it can be for all of the talents. They can't all be the main event, but he wants them all ready when they get their opportunity when they make the main roster. They have to give them the tools to do it.\n\nH apologized for being late, but that is SummerSlam week. He hopes we all enjoy Takeover and Mae Young, and left with a get well soon for Ric Flair.", "dateTime": "2017-08-15T22:00:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367206", "time": "22:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "76", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 1}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "315017", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE", "score": 5}, {"id": "315018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bobby Roode"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Roode", "score": 1}, {"id": "324818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 1}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332483", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Johnny Gargano"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Gargano", "score": 1}, {"id": "332488", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Triple H"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_H", "score": 5}, {"id": "340541", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shawn Michaels"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Michaels", "score": 3}, {"id": "340548", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ric Flair"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Flair", "score": 3}, {"id": "343925", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dave Meltzer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Meltzer", "score": 2}, {"id": "343927", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WWE Performance Center"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Performance_Center", "score": 3}, {"id": "345417", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 31"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "score": 4}, {"id": "479958", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kenta Kobayashi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenta_Kobayashi", "score": 1}, {"id": "614998", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "score": 2}, {"id": "744376", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Gabe Sapolsky"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Sapolsky", "score": 3}, {"id": "760572", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mae Young"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Young", "score": 4}, {"id": "1271586", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT TakeOver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_TakeOver", "score": 4}, {"id": "1272200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Braun Strowman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braun_Strowman", "score": 2}, {"id": "1272228", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nia Jax"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nia_Jax", "score": 2}, {"id": "1273434", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Alexa Bliss"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexa_Bliss", "score": 2}, {"id": "1274824", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baron Corbin"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Corbin", "score": 2}], "image": "https://411mania.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Triple-H-Smug.jpg", "timeCrawl": "10:48:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Triple H Media Call Notes: Releasing The Mae Young Classic, Brooklyn Being NXT's WrestleMania, More | 411MANIA", "originalArticle": null}

While the past two years created memorable moments such as the Bayley vs. Sasha Banks NXT Women's Championship match, Shinsuke Nakamura winning the NXT Championship from Samoa Joe, The Vaudevillains winning the NXT Tag Team Championship from Blake & Murphy, and Jushin \"Thunder\" Liger competing against Tyler Breeze, this year aims to be the best one yet.\n\nThe title matches have come with weeks of build and anticipation. Drew McIntyre became the No. 1 contender for the NXT Championship by defeating Killian Dain, Ember Moon worked her way up to becoming the top contender for Asuka's NXT Women's Championship, and Sanity became No. 1 contenders for the NXT Tag Team Championship after dominating the division for months.\n\nWhile the match between Sanity and the Authors of Pain has an appeal of a hard-hitting brawl, the issue rests in the fans not having a legitimate babyface team to cheer for, since both Sanity and AOP are two of the most villainous teams in NXT. Typically, this leads to a match without a strong level of support from the fans.\n\nThis concern was further affirmed during recent event where the two teams competed against each other.\n\nAccording to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, the match at the SUREC Arena in San Jose, California pitted the Sanity combination of Eric Young and Alexander Wolfe competed against the AOP. The Newsletter reports that \"This was the worst match on the show. It just didn't click, was short, had the least level of crowd heat, and had a crap ending.\" Outside of having numerous botches during the match, Sanity worked as faces despite being strong heels on television.\n\nWhile the crowd did manage to get behind Sanity, they hated the finish and reacted accordingly. As a result, the hopes that Sanity would get over a babyfaces failed. In addition, Killian Dain was not used or seen during to match due to being a very strong heel and potentially hurting Sanity's attempt at being babyfaces.\n\nCome TakeOver: Brooklyn III, it should be interesting how the New York crowd evaluates this match, especially with both teams being disliked. Unfortunately, it may substantially effect the reaction and energy of the match, similar to the crowd in San Jose.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T20:24:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.572549045085907, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367206", "time": "20:24:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373927", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "216991", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "218051", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "229201", "label": {"eng": "San Jose"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jose"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "304688", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of professional wrestling terms"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms", "score": 3}, {"id": "307120", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "315019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Samoa Joe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_Joe", "score": 3}, {"id": "324818", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "score": 3}, {"id": "332481", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "score": 5}, {"id": "332493", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Nakamura"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Nakamura", "score": 3}, {"id": "343925", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dave Meltzer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Meltzer", "score": 2}, {"id": "358626", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jushin Liger"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jushin_Liger", "score": 3}, {"id": "383378", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Championship", "score": 4}, {"id": "386419", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mercedes KV"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes_KV", "score": 3}, {"id": "386420", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bayley (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayley_(wrestler)", "score": 3}, {"id": "388249", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tyler Breeze"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Breeze", "score": 3}, {"id": "448339", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Women's Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Women's_Championship", "score": 4}, {"id": "510496", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Eric Young (wrestler)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Young_(wrestler)", "score": 2}, {"id": "516462", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "NXT Tag Team Championship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXT_Tag_Team_Championship", "score": 4}, {"id": "614998", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "score": 3}, {"id": "1282017", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Vaudevillains"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vaudevillains", "score": 3}], "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Authors-of-Pain-v-Sanity.jpg", "timeCrawl": "20:24:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Major Concern Regarding Sanity Vs.

The first four episodes will be released Aug. 28.\n\nOne thing the veteran performers all share -- other than a history of matches in some combination against each other -- is a feeling that their path has been instrumental in how quickly they have elevated in WWE. Still, all but Styles spent time in NXT -- WWE's third brand that is focused on development -- and WWE's Performance Center in Orlando because working for a wrestling company and working for a television company that produces wrestling are different things.\n\n\"They've got a lot of experience and been a lot of places, but no one has taught them how to do television; no one has taught them camera angles or the subtleties,\" said Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque, WWE's executive vice president for talent, live events and creative. \"We shoot a television show with a backdrop that happens to be the WWE Universe, a WWE ring and the competitors work in that ring, but it's still a television show. Nobody has taught them that way, nobody is doing the things that what we're doing in terms of the difference in the product. No matter where you come from, you have to learn that and have the learning curve.\"\n\nMORE:\n\nSamoa Joe's long journey to WWE shows he's always ready to fight\n\nWWE's Alexa Bliss embraces being 'Five Feet of Fury'\n\nWWE's Seth Rollins makes film debut\n\nAs Levesque notes, the route to superstar begins with the tools to success, but there is much more even in an industry in which the winners and losers are predetermined.\n\n\"Sure, in some ways it's up to us, but in a lot of ways up to them. They have to deliver,\" he said. You could be the best college football player in the world, win the Heisman Trophy, get drafted really high and then go to the pros and not make it. Why? There are a lot of factors and this is no different. We try to give everyone the opportunity to be the absolute best they can be. We give them the tools to success ... and then set them free.\"\n\nStyles' WWE debut was at the Royal Rumble in 2016 and he has acknowledged that he faced a more difficult route to get acclimated to the WWE way by bypassing time in NXT. Levesque said it depends on the particular talent and the needs of the main roster as to whether another performer might join the main roster without working in NXT. At the Performance Center, the company can work with talent without being in front of a live crowd to explain camera angles and production.\n\n\"They don't have to necessarily have be on NXT television, but they have to be around it and learning it,\" Levesque said.\n\nFor Roode, his NXT debut was in August 2016 and became NXT champion in January when he beat Nakamura.\n\n\"This has been a learning curve for me,\" Roode said, \"but it's been a lot of fun learning and trying to get better. ... The greatest decision I've ever made in my career was to come here.\"\n\nOwens recently marked three years with WWE, was the subject of a DVD set in April and hit 1 million Twitter followers last week. He won the NXT title in February 2015, just two months after his debut. Since joining the main roster in May 2015, he has been Universal champion, a three-time United States champion and two-time Intercontinental champion. Before coming to WWE, Owens worked under his given name, Kevin Steen.\n\n\"Over the three years, there wasn't really a time when I was treading water and not really doing anything important,\" Owens said. \"It's all been pretty incredible if I'm being completely honest. ...\n\n\"It felt like it took me a while to get here -- it was 14 years from the time my first match happened to when I got my WWE contract -- but it really does feel like since I've been here, I've made up for lost time.\"\n\nOwens also has learned what the exposure from WWE means in life away from the ring. At one point, he was besieged with photo requests during a family vacation to Disneyland with his two young children. He turned down the fans but then thanked them on Twitter for being respectful and understanding of his family time.\n\n\"It's definitely something that comes with it in a way I didn't expect,\" he said of the attention. \"I go on my daily routine when I'm at home and people see me, want to take pictures and talk to me about what I'm doing. It's so humbling and really cool because to me, I'm just this guy who is walking around getting my kids shoes at Target and stuff like that. I don't feel like I'm a big deal. I just feel like a regular dude. I'm just me.\"\n\nJoe sees the group of veteran newcomers as potentially opening a new pathway for other talent.\n\n\"We've helped shine a spotlight on talent from alternative places,\" Joe said. \"I don't want to say it was neglected, but it was overlooked because of protocol within the company. They are broadening their search and looking at more guys, possibly more than they ever have. If we can be the catalyst for that, then that's pretty awesome.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Day in sports\n\nDay in Sports Fullscreen Michelle Wie of the U.S. tees off on the 18th hole during the second practice round for The Solheim Cup International Golf Tournament at Des Moines Golf and Country Club in West Des Moines, Iowa.

And we're back to the show that innovated the concept of the pre-\"Big 4\" event with TakeOver: Brooklyn III on the eve of SummerSlam.\n\nThe card comes our way from Barclays Center at 8PM Eastern, exclusively on WWE Network. NXT champion Bobby Roode fighting for his NXT against Drew McIntyre, who's trying to make the most of his second chance by winning the title for the fans. Ember Moon tries to end undefeated Women's titleholder Asuka's historic run with that belt, while tag champs Authors of Pain may have met their heel-ish match in Eric Young's SAnitY.\n\nIn non-title action, Johnny Gargano is looking to make his mark as a singles wrestler, but he'll have to beat Andrade \"Cien\" Almas in Brookyn, and Cien's been re-motivated since his associate Zelina Vega arrived in NXT. And Hideo Itami hasn't much cared who he's pissed off of late, but he may have bitten off more than he can chew with the undefeated Aleister Black.\n\nIf you're new or someone who only checks out NXT for the live specials, we've got a full preview of the matches coming up for you between now and belltime. Right now, we've assembled a motley crew of Cagesiders who watch & love NXT to give us their thoughts & predictions on each.\n\nSean Rueter: There's still mileage in The Glorious One's run, especially since he's got the best angles of his championship set up with Drew and Roderick Strong, and more (currently babyface) challenges lined up in Aleister Black and possibly even Johnny Gargano. Whether or not this goes on last will tell us a lot... because if the women are main eventing, we might get the first NXT title non-finish in TakeOver history due to Roddy-ference. Pick: Bobby Roode\n\nKyle Decker: Not really sure about this one. Roddy is going to be involved in the future. If both Roddy and Drew are going to be party of the title picture, and win or lose, so will Bobby, things are better with the belt on the heel. Pick: Bobby Roode\n\nReverendKain: After the way Strong/McIntyre went and ended, I want nothing more than for Drew to knock Bobby off his pedestal, let absolute power corrupt absolutely, and have the TakeOver: New Orleans feud be a rerun of their Evolve feud with the alignments flipped. I might not GET that, but I can't not vote with my mark hat on, with this one. Pick: Drew McIntyre\n\nStella Cheeks (of the always awesome NYD podcast): Well, I can't exactly go against my heart here. McIntyre (affectionately known as Drewboo) is my guy. Additionally, Drew is so good at the fighting champ/open challenge gimmick that it makes sense to have him hold the belt considering how many indie singles men they are bringing in (hint: BAYBAY). Roode has been a fun champ but would also fit well in the main roster or in a grudge feud with The Room star, Roderick Strong. Pick: Drew McIntyre\n\nOurLadyJustice (aka Dea): This is actually kind of a tough one for me. On one hand, Bobby Roo's held the title for quite a long time now, and while I AM the type to dig on his brand of character, I get that a change is due. The story they've been telling, however, says that Roode needs to hang onto to the title in order to keep things going with Roderick Strong. I'm just so torn. All right, I'mma go with the happy ending, and say we'll get a new champ that can open things up. Pick: Drew McIntyre\n\nErin Cline (the more enigmatic half of Not Your Demographic): WHY DON'T I CARE ABOUT EITHER OF THESE GUYS?????? Individually, and out of the ring, I like both of them just fine. But Bobby has been so bland in ring that I'm not at all hype for anything past his entrance (which will definitely be dope), and I just am not here for Drew winning the title already. What is he doing that is any more interesting than Ohno or Itami or Black or Cien or Fish or Kale O'Reilly? He also just got there and other than having beautiful thighs and a dreamy accent I just don't understand the push to immediately put the belt on him. But, it feels inevitable - there is nothing left for Bobby to do on NXT and with the rumors of another shuffle after SummerSlam it feels like we're going to be closing with a new champ. Pick: Drew McIntyre\n\nSean Rueter: It's time, I suppose. While I wish it felt more epic, I'm not sure anything short of a challenge from Goldberg himself could. Going out with a great, 20 minute classic would help. I'm pulling for you, ladies. Pick: Ember Moon\n\nKyle Decker: It's time. Asuka has been undefeated for all this time, but it's time for someone to beat that streak and for the Empress to move on to Raw or SmackDown. They were smart not doing the change at Orlando and decided to build this story up more. But it's at a point where the title change feels right. Pick: Ember Moon\n\nReverendKain: All good things, and so on. 506 days ain't bad, all things considered. Pick: Ember Moon\n\nStella Cheeks: Ember Moon is rising. <werewolf noise> But seriously if Ember can't beat Asuka who can? Asuka is literally the longest reigning champ in the new era, we need her on the main roster and NXT needs the roster space for all the Mae Young Classic signees. This match will be a show stealer, I love these women, I love wrestling (dissolves into tears). Pick: Ember Moon\n\nOurLadyJustice: Same kind of thing applies here in that I know it should be time for a new champ, but am I the only one who feels like Ember hasn't really earned it? I think I'll actually be disappointed if she does win this right now because Asuka seem like a truly unbeatable force at this point. I've talked myself into her retaining. Pick: Asuka\n\nErin Cline: It feels inevitable that Asuka is dropping the title at TakeOver. She'll have just passed the record to become the longest running champ of any kind in the modern era, which is what they have really wanted for some time and Asuka happens to be the person they could keep a belt on long enough to actually do it. However, after such a long build that included an injury for Ember, there is no better time to do it. Ember is not the unstoppable monster that Asuka is and this will give the feeling of competition back to the women's division on NXT, which it has not felt like they've had for some time. Even with Nikki and Ruby, once it became clear that Asuka was going to break all the records, it never felt like they were really willing to take the belt off of her. Ember is the person to do it and reset the division while Asuka moves up and we can maybe see her wrestle more than once a month. Pick: Ember Moon\n\nSean Rueter: Something tells me Team EY is showing up on SmackDown soon, possibly laughing over Breezango and The Ascension's broken bodies. And I think Shane Thorne is due back shortly, too. Pick: Authors of Pain\n\nKyle Decker: This has the feel of a time killing feud until they try to establish a true babyface team to oust the Authors. It'll be fun and a bit out of control, but the ending will be something we've seen before: Ellering's team victorious. Pick: Authors of Pain\n\nReverendKain: SAnitY haven't exactly been great, but just conceptually it's a shame they never really had a chance to run roughshod with a reign of terror over NXT, and I can't see one starting here. Pick: Authors of Pain\n\nStella Cheeks: I have high hopes for this match - if only for the Nikki Cross snarling around the ring. AoP has proven that they can have great matches and the idea of their size in contrast to SAnitY's craziness is exciting. I do think AoP retains but I bet this match really takes people off guard with how good it is. Pick: Authors of Pain\n\nOurLadyJustice: I really hope this match is balls-out crazy. AoP is big and methodical, while SAnitY is I-don't-even-know on any given day. That alone should provide for an interesting go in the ring. If I'm honest, though, I'd like to see this championship change hands, especially since I think this match is \"Most Likely To Involve Shenanigans\". Pick: SAnitY\n\nErin Cline: Guys. I just... don't care about this match at all. I'm sure it's going to be fun and the AoP have really brought me around on their wrestling... but I still don't care at all about Paul's children or whatever they are. Paul Ellering just is not enough personality for all three of them for me. And I also feel like Dain is set for a singles run so it would be strange to put the tag belts on him right now. It seems sort of silly to put Dain in a ring with people who diminish his size, but with such a stacked title card picture (also full of giants) there isn't really room for him anyway. Pick: Authors of Pain (I guess?)\n\nSean Rueter: As Dr. Ishiro Serizawa once said, \"Let them fight\". Then light one of the them sit stoically cross-legged in victory. Pick: Aleister Black\n\nKyle Decker: I'm looking forward to this bout the most. Aleister's roll out has been great and heel Itami has been on point. Black is one of the leagues of undefeateds in NXT and this is a good time to get that first loss out of the way. Hideo can be dirty (perhaps a low blow when the ref isn't looking) to get the win and maybe give an excuse to see this match again. Pick: Hideo Itami\n\nReverendKain: Men may never be truly good nor truly evil, but they can well and truly be knocked out with Black Mass. It bums me out a little, but in neither kayfabe nor reality can I see the former NOAH man taking Black out here. Pick: Aleister Black\n\nStella Cheeks: Aleister Black is unstoppable. Super hot and unstoppable. AB wins and further progresses Itami's heel turn into full blown monster heel. Would not be surprised if after AB wins, Itami loses his sh*t and there is a post match beat down. Either way AB = V hot. Pick: Aleister Black\n\nOurLadyJustice: I like the change in Hideo, and I like the way that most of his new story has been handled. On the other side of that, Aleister Black is pretty fantastic, and he's been one of the best handled stars new to NXT that they've done in a while. How many others can say that? I think this has really good MOTN potential and could go either way, but I think I'm going to go with my gut feeling on this, and Aleister Black will not go to sleep. Pick: Aleister Black\n\nErin Cline: They've been building Black as a monster who is inevitably going to be in the title picture, and is thus far undefeated - however, Hitami could also really use a good win. Since he's the bad guy here though he can take a loss in a way that doesn't really make sense for Black at the moment. Honestly I'm just looking forward to watching Itami get Black up in position for a GTS. GTS into a dope Black Magic maybe? I'm here for it. Pick: Aleister Black\n\nSean Rueter: He can't lose his first spotlight match with Zelina Vega by his side. And maybe a certain sling-wearing Sicilian shows up, even just as a guest of Kevin Owens, to distract J. Wrestling? Pick: Andrade \"Cien\" Almas\n\nKyle Decker: This looks like a match of two guys who could use a win. Johnny is kicking off his single's career while Almas is a guy who is trying to break a pretty nasty losing streak. Andrade really needs the win more though. If he is still losing with the help of Ms. Vega, then what's the point of all this? Pick: Andrade \"Cien\" Almas\n\nReverendKain: Almas is just a little too set in his Ingobernable ways, and Johnny Wrestling is gonna teach him a lesson that he and Vega can study over the next few weeks. Pick: Johnny Gargano\n\nStella Cheeks: Maybe I'm crazy, but I really think Cien is going to win this. He lost for so long and has been on a tranquilo fast/winning streak since Zelena joined his side. It would make sense to have her be the reason he got his act together and finally strung together a couple big wins. Especially since she's the one that made the match. Gargano went through a trauma so he's still making his comeback. He can take the loss. Pick: Andrade \"Cien\" Almas\n\nOurLadyJustice: This one kind of depends on what they want more: feel-good comeback for Johnny or more heat on Andrade. I think it makes more sense to go with heat on Andrade because Johnny as underdog is everyone else's favorite story. Also, fuck Johnny Wrestling, I hate that guy. Spite Pick: Andrade \"Cien\" Almas\n\nErin Cline: One of these days Cien will actually get to win AND I WILL FEEL SO VINDICATED but that day is not today. These guys will have a great match that will ultimately end with the greatest babyface of all time, Johnny, coming up with the victory.

The glory lies in rising back up N.M pic.twitter.com/zBst0RTW93 -- Drew McIntyre (@DMcIntyreWWE)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nIt's the latest step in his lifelong wrestling journey: one that includes a previous stint with the WWE. McIntyre used his release from WWE in 2014 as an opportunity to rebuild himself and set out on a quest to prove he is one of the top stars in the business.\n\nHe embarked on an ambitious plan that saw him work with top independent promotions around the world. It was an exhausting schedule that saw him on the road week after week with countless plane rides and little sleep or time with his family. But it was working: people and promotions were taking notice.\n\nThat included WWE and NXT executive Paul Levesque -- better known as Triple H -- who had a phone conversation with him in April. He wanted McIntyre to join the NXT brand and make a surprise appearance at that night's \"TakeOver\" event in Orlando, the night before \"WrestleMania 32.\"\n\n\"After I got off the phone with him, one, I was very honored that he wanted me to be part of his baby in NXT and two, my mind was made up,\" said McIntyre. \"I knew I had to be in NXT. I knew that was the next step for me and my family.\n\n\"And walking in the door, seeing all the faces that I knew and faces that I didn't know that I wanted to work with, I thought, wow, this is going to be something. We have something special here, and we really do.\"\n\nMcIntyre knows that Levesque keeps his finger on the pulse of wrestling around the world. That included McIntyre and his evolution since leaving WWE three years earlier.\n\n\"They always say that I grew up in Scotland at home, then I moved to America and straight to WWE and that was home,\" said McIntyre. \"I finally left the nest at 29 to go out on my own. He's very happy and proud of everything that I was able to achieve which was a pretty cool feeling. But an even better feeling getting the opportunity to come in and be one of the top players in his brand and one of the top brands, if not the top brand, in the entire world.\"\n\nHis journey has seen him grow up in front of the world. He signed with the WWE at the ripe age of 21 and was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling a former training ground for the company. It took just three weeks before he made his television debut on \"SmackDown\", the fastest ever for someone in their developmental system.\n\nHis time on the main roster only lasted a few months before he was sent to OVW and Florida Championship Wrestling to sharpen his skills. Come to find out, he had a huge fan in Vince McMahon. On an episode of \"SmackDown\" in September 2009, the WWE Chairman introduced McIntyre as a \"future world champion\" and dubbed him the \"Chosen One\" which McIntyre calls one of his career highlights.\n\n\"He saw something in me when I was younger that I didn't necessarily see myself and maybe others didn't see which is a pretty cool feeling,\" said McIntyre. \"And finally, years later, after all the things I've been through and growing up, I think, finally, now it's starting to materialize and everyone is starting to see what he saw back in the day. He had that kind of faith in me and saw something in me that he was willing to endorse me in that way and perhaps it just took a minute and took a few life experiences to actually bring out what he saw.\"\n\nThe \"Chosen One\" character never fully panned out and several years later, McIntyre found himself in the comedic group 3MB alongside Heath Slater and current WWE Champion Jinder Mahal. Even though the \"Chosen One\" didn't work as hoped, he doesn't shy away from it either.\n\n\u1f633 @DMcIntyreWWE is about to take our breath away during @WWE #SummerSlam weekend. Don't miss @WWENXT Takeover 8/19! https://t.co/sHSSjiOC8j pic.twitter.com/pH9HOwNdAU -- Barclays Center (@barclayscenter)\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\n\"We have that past,\" explained McIntyre. \"We have that story. Why not talk about it because in the end, now, it's who I needed to be all along. It just took that journey to get there and sometimes, the journey is the exciting part and we have a built-in story. I want to talk about it. I want to inspire people and show people no matter what happens, no matter how much you get knocked down, you can pick yourself up. Just keep pushing forward, keep being positive.\"\n\nThat attitude comes from him being an obsessed wrestling fan since he was ten years old growing up in Ayr, Scotland. To this day, he'll tell you that he'd be surprised if you could find a bigger fan than him.\n\n\"I sent away to America for 'The Inside Secrets of Wrestling' that Percy Pringle and Dennis Brent wrote and Volume 1 told me to keep kayfabe of the book,\" said McIntyre. \"So I used to keep it in a briefcase and I'd go to school every day and everyone would talk about wrestling and they didn't know what was going on but I knew what was going on. I wasn't telling them that I knew what was going on backstage because I was keeping kayfabe, brother, at 10. I started training when I was 15.\n\n\"I've just been obsessed and been pushing and pushing and pushing and the whole time, I've never forgotten that, in the end, I'm a fan. It's been my life and it always will be my life.\"\n\nWhen the opportunity arose that he could learn from Shawn Michaels, who is now an instructor at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Fla., the fan in McIntyre couldn't turn down the opportunity to work with the legend even though what they discuss is under lock and key.\n\n\"I have to say first off: the first rule of Shawn Club is you don't talk about Shawn Club,\" explained McIntyre. \"I feel very fortunate to get the chance to work with him. I didn't necessarily have to go to the Performance Center but I live two hours away and Shawn Michaels, the best wrestler ever, is teaching a class.\n\n\"The guys in there, it's a great situation. We all get in these healthy debates about things and we're really all working on our Ph.D. with the man himself.\"\n\nIt's a refined, grown up version of McIntyre that we now see, one that he says is different in every way. That comes with a new calm both in the ring and on the microphone.\n\n\"When you're relaxed, the crowd can see it, they can feel it, they can tell when you're being real or they can tell when you're forcing it,\" said McIntyre. \"I'm actually just taking it all in and just, as Undertaker used to tell me, being the wrestler rather than playing the wrestler, I finally found that.\"\n\nIt hasn't just been a journey of wrestling that the 32-year-old McIntyre has been on but a journey of life, of finding himself and growing into the person he is now. He got married over the past year and credits his wife, Kaitlyn, for helping him grow up.\n\n\"She put up with me being gone for basically three years straight and being the busiest wrestler in the world,\" said McIntyre. \"She's been a big part in that. Sometimes when you're traveling for a long time as a kid, you don't have a sense of what's normal, what's not normal in the real world I guess. It took a minute.\n\n\"I'm exactly where I need to be in every area because what you see on TV is not the be all, end all,\" explained McIntyre. \"It's the minimal of what it takes to be a top guy in this business. I really learned everything else outside the ring to truly be a guy that can come in and lead a publicly traded company like WWE. Now, I'm finally ready for that responsibility.\"\n\nThe next step is Saturday night at \"NXT TakeOver\" and putting on a show-stealing and weekend-stealing performance with Roode.\n\n\"I'm ready to bring something special and, as I've said before, we have a silent competition with 'SummerSlam' the next night and competition is very healthy for everybody. We're looking to put on a show that will have people talking.\"\n\nBrian Fritz can be reached at btrfritz@\n\nBrian Fritz can be reached at btrfritz@gmail.com.

So who represents the spirit of the brand?\n\nLet's just say it's a new day in NXT.\n\nIt was apparent early on that McIntryre had the size and intensity edge. And outside a failed attempt at the Glorious DDT, the beginning of the match was all Drew, controlling the champion inside the ring and out.\n\nBut Roode is crafty. There's a reason he's the undefeated champion. He landed a neck breaker on the rope to the challenger and started working over McIntyre's head and neck.\n\nDrew endured some punishment, but of course he fought back. They would exchange blows and momentum until McIntryre hit his Future Shock DDT. But the champ kicked out. The fight would continue.\n\nAfter a slugfest in the middle of the ring, Drew hit his Claymore kick finisher. Unfortunately for him, Roode got his foot up on the rope to prevent defeat. Bobby rolled out of the ring to take a breather but McIntyre hit a tope con giro onto the champ!\n\nHowever, by the time Drew got Roode back in the ring, the champ was ready to fight again. An exchange of moves led to a Glorious DDT. But McIntyre kicked out!\n\nThen Roode hit a second which he tries to chain into the third... but the challenger delivered a headbutt!

There were also some major championship losses which could mean some main roster debuts are on the way. The latest event featured two championships changing hands, while another remained in the possession of its longtime owner. Could this have been a major turning point in the landscape of the various WWE rosters? Here's what came about during the first of the WWE's big events this weekend from Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nAccording to a results report from Pro Wrestling, the second match of the night on the card had the Authors of Pain defending their NXT Tag Team Championships against Sanity. Killian Dain and Alexander Wolfe represented their team as Nikki Cross and Eric Young were ringside. The match lasted 12 minutes in total time with the finale featuring a big spot where Dain hit a cross body to crash through a ringside table with one of the Authors and Nikki. Moments later, Sanity hit a back suplex and diving neck breaker move to finish off the champs. With that, Sanity became the new tag team champions.\n\nThe celebration in the ring was short-lived, though. Moments after they had won the title, a pair of attackers rushed into the ring. It ended up being Kyle O'Reilly and Bobby Fish. They didn't just put down the new champions but also the Authors of Pain. After laying out all of the NXT stars, Fish and O'Reilly grabbed the tag team belts to give them a look before leaving the ring.\n\nThe NXT Women's Championship was also on the line at the latest NXT TakeOver event. Asuka has held the title for a reign of over 502 days, surpassing Rockin' Robin's WWF Women's Championship run as the longest reign in WWE history. On Saturday night, she took on her rival Ember Moon. The two women's superstars battled for nearly 15 minutes, going back and forth with near falls and finishers.\n\nLate in the match, Moon nearly was able to go for the Eclipse but Asuka wisely hid behind the referee. Moon had another near fall after connecting on a super kick. The finish came when Asuka put on a cross armbar and then the Asuka Lock. Eventually, the challenger had to tap out, meaning the longest reign in history will continue.\n\nThe grand finale of the night was the NXT Championship match featuring Bobby Roode defending the title against Drew McIntyre. The former WWE star has been on an impressive run since making his return to the company after spending time with TNA Impact Wrestling. In tonight's match, not only did fans see a tremendous back and forth battle, but also a surprising debut.\n\nThis match went for over 22 minutes. The closing moments saw the champion attempt a DDT and after failing on that, hitting a tilt-a-whirl followed by the Glorious DDT. However, the challenger was able to kick out of the pinfall. Moments later, Roode hit a second Glorious DDT. He was about to go for another, but McIntyre countered by head butting Roode and then delivering the Claymore Kick. After that, Roode was down for the three count as Drew McIntyre claimed the NXT Championship from him.\n\nIt was another championship celebration on NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn III, and yet another one that was interrupted. Once again, Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly showed up. The duo hopped onto the apron, causing a distraction to McIntyre. Suddenly, another attacker rushed into the ring, and fans soon realized it was former Ring of Honor star Adam Cole. The former ROH Champion launched an all-out beatdown on McIntyre and had O'Reilly and Fish help out. The show closed out with the trio standing tall over the brand new champion who was laid out on the mat.\n\nWith tonight's big developments and championship losses, it seems to point towards some new possibilities. There have been rumors that various WWE officials want to call up several NXT stars to the main roster. Among the names mentioned have been Asuka, Bobby Roode, and Authors of Pain. Roode and the Authors were on the losing end of their matches tonight, bringing their title reigns to an end. While they may lay claim to rematches, one has to think it will be a matter of time before they hit Raw or SmackDown Live.\n\nAs for Adam Cole, Kyle O'Reilly and Bobby Fish, it would seem like just the beginning of an interesting new path for these wrestling stars on the NXT roster.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:02:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "dateCrawl":

(Ricardo Ramirez Buxeda/Orlando Sentinel/Tribune News Service via Getty Images) TNS The failure of Disney\u2019s \u201cStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser\u201d \u2014 a spaceship-themed hotel marketed as an immersive roleplaying experience \u2014 is under the spotlight thanks to a viral YouTube video. The hotly anticipated Star Wars hotel opened its doors in 2022, only to close them a year later. In the wake of the unexpected shutdown, the Washington Post concluded that the Starcruiser was too niche and too expensive to attract a consistent flow of guests. YouTuber Jenny Nicholson took a deeper dive, releasing a four-hour video essay titled \u201cThe Spectacular Failure of the Star Wars Hotel,\u201d arguing that Disney oversold and under-delivered. Nicholson relayed her own underwhelming stay at the hotel and concluded that her disappointing experience reflected the decay of Disney\u2019s theme parks, riddled with inconveniences and paywalls. Despite its intimidating length, the video essay has been watched more than 5 million times, launching the failed Starcruiser back into the discourse.

Nicholson has more than 1.1 million subscribers on YouTube, and is known to cover fan culture and media. Nicholson seemed prepared for this topic, as she has released several videos discussing Star Wars and reviewing theme parks in great detail, such as Disney\u2019s \u201cPandora\u2014 The World of Avatar.\u201d Nicholson\u2019s earnest enthusiasm for roleplay and fandom makes her critique seem all the more devastating \u2014 one gets the impression that she very much wanted to enjoy her time at the Starcruiser. One commenter described Nicholson as an enthusiast who \u201costensibly worships Disney parks/products but remains logical instead of fanatical about it.\u201d Following the release of her Star Wars video, movie critic David Ehrlich jokingly described Nicholson as \u201cAmerica's greatest filmmaker.\u201d What Did Jenny Nicholson Say About The \u2018Star Wars\u2019 Hotel? Nicholson says that she paid more than $6,000 for a two-night stay in the hotel, which in her estimation, amounted to $2 per-minute, and spends a great deal of time explaining why the Star Wars hotel just wasn\u2019t worth it. The Starcruiser was marketed as a deeply immersive roleplaying experience (like an elaborate escape room or real-life video game), featuring interactive storylines, quests, and meaningful choices. Costumed staff members were performing as Star Wars characters, meant to react appropriately to guest\u2019s choices with the help of an AI-driven app designed to organize activities and events. In order for the games to run smoothly, guests were expected to keep to a densely scheduled itinerary, with even their mealtimes planned in advance. Despite sticking to her itinerary, Nicholson explains how her experience fell comically short of what was promised by Disney. While Nicholson acknowledges that there were guests who had no issues, she says the app was constantly malfunctioning for her group, rendering their choices irrelevant and the staff unaware of their actions. The roleplay element wasn\u2019t the only failure \u2014 Nicholson attests that the interior of the hotel was cramped, disorienting and surprisingly bland. These criticisms have been made before; the Starcruiser has even been compared to the prison featured in Andor). As a running joke throughout the video, Nicholson repeatedly mentions that she was seated behind a pillar during a scheduled mealtime performance, blocking her view. The video wasn\u2019t all negative \u2014 Nicholson also made suggestions on how the experience could have been improved, making sure to mention the highlights of the trip and praising the efforts of the staff, who seemed to be trying their best despite lacking the needed resources. Overall, Nicholson described the Starcruiser as \u201dDisney's boldest experiment in exorbitant upcharges.\u201d How Did The Internet React To Jenny Nicholson\u2019s Video? On social media, many commentators expressed surprise that such a lengthy video on a random subject could prove so entertaining, and the video soon sparked memes, skits and further criticism of Disney. TwitterLi Speaks on Twitter: \"the jenny nicholson star wars hotel video has given me a new lease on life. no matter how much of a bad time i'm having, i can tell myself \"at least i'm not paying $2 per person per minute for this\" / Twitter\" TwitterKatie Rife on Twitter: \"Hour two of this Jenny Nicholson Star Wars hotel video and I'm enthralled. I've never watched one of her videos before, but this tiny woman brings the RECEIPTS. / Twitter\" This isn\u2019t the first time that the Star Wars hotel has been condemned by disappointed guests, but Nicholson\u2019s detailed coverage, along with her pictures and videos from the event, proved particularly damning; the video makes the Starcruiser seem like Disney\u2019s Fyre Festival. Days after Nicholson\u2019s video went viral, an article passionately defending the Star Wars hotel was published in Screenrant, written by a former employee who claimed that their experience of the Starcruiser had been nothing but positive, describing the job as a life-changing experience. While Nicholson\u2019s video was not mentioned by name, the article argues that there was nothing to gain from publishing negative reviews of the Starcruiser and that such commentary only hurts the feelings of former staff (commentators noted that Nicholson did not criticize the staff, only the Disney execs who oversaw the project). The success of Nicholson\u2019s video reflects the increasing popularity of long-form content on YouTube, and the power of trusted influencers. Content creators who have cultivated a reputation for honest, thoughtful critique, such as Marques Brownlee and Keith Lee, are capable of shifting the discourse. For Disney, the \u201cspectacular\u201d failure of the Starcruiser is the latest in a long line of Star Wars controversies, as many fans believe that the entertainment giant has mishandled the franchise by releasing too much content, too soon, and leaning too heavily on nostalgia and fan service. In her review of the critically panned conclusion to the Star Wars sequel trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker, Nicholson made a point that seemed to reflect her Starcruiser experience, stating: \"The worst thing a franchise ending can do is make you feel kind of stupid and embarrassed for being so excited about it in the first place.\" Follow me on Twitter.

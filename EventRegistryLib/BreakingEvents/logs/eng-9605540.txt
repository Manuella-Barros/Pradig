We will stop the anxiety of wondering if an ambulance will come on time. We will bring back the family doctor.\n\n\"The NHS has been there for my family when we needed it. I'll make sure it's there for everyone.\"\n\nThe Labour leader said he was inspired by Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, where staff had high-intensity theatre lists on weekends up and running within six weeks.\n\nHe said: \"It was NHS staff working in the hospital I can see from my office in Parliament who led the way on this new model.\n\n\"Labour will take the best of the NHS to the rest of the NHS, so patients in every part of the country can be treated on time.\"\n\nKathryn Marszalek, senior analytical manager at the Health Foundation, warned tackling waiting lists through weekend and evening work \"must not come at a cost to staff wellbeing\".\n\nShe also called on the next government to \"provide stable, long-term investment to meet the high demand for both hospital and primary care\".\n\nEarlier this month, figures from NHS England revealed the size of the waiting list for routine hospital treatment in England was unchanged in March, following five consecutive monthly falls.\n\nAn estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients, the same numbers as in February.\n\nHowever, some 309,300 patients had been waiting more than 52 weeks to start routine hospital treatment, up from 305,050.\n\nThe number of people waiting more than 65 weeks to start treatment fell from 75,004 to 48,968.\n\nThe Government and NHS England had pledged to eliminate all waits of more than a year by March 2025, while the target to eliminate all waits of more than 65 weeks has been moved to September 2024, having previously been March 2024.\n\nThe party highlighted that Tony Blair's Labour government cut maximum waiting times from 18 months to 18 weeks.\n\nShadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \"Over 14 years the Conservatives have taken the golden inheritance left by the last Labour government and wrecked it.\n\n\"Their neglect, incompetence and underinvestment in the NHS has left millions of people waiting in pain and agony.\"\n\nHe accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of having \"given up on the NHS\" with \"no plan to turn this crisis around\".\n\n\"Patients deserve solutions not scapegoats,\" Mr Streeting added.\n\nHowever, Health Secretary Victoria Atkins described the plans as \"more 'copy and paste' politics from Labour, who have no plan\".\n\n\"Last week we exposed Labour's 'no new hospitals' pledge, in which they have said they will delay the Government's building programme for new hospitals,\" she added.\n\nMs Atkins said the health service \"has faced unprecedented challenges which it can only overcome if supported by a strong economy\".\n\nShe insisted the Conservatives \"have a clear plan and will take bold action to strengthen the economy and continue to deliver the technology and innovation the NHS needs to keep cutting waiting lists\".\n\nThea Stein, chief executive of think tank the Nuffield Trust, welcomed Labour's focus on waiting lists, but warned the estimated \u00a31.3 billion will \"cover only a limited amount of extra care\".\n\n\"Labour is right to focus on waiting lists, where progress has been slow and our analysis of the British Social Attitudes survey shows public concern is very high.\n\n\"We support the intention to spend more money on equipment, historically the victim of short-termism.\n\n\"However, the sum of money they are proposing will cover only a limited amount of extra care, not enough for a rapid or sudden improvement.\n\n\"It is unclear how more private sector capacity could be used without additional funding - or how much capacity there is left after rapid recent increases in reliance upon it.\n\n\"The problem of NHS productivity, which has fallen for complex reasons since the Covid-19 pandemic and which needs careful national leadership to tackle, also needs to be more of a priority.\"\n\nSarah Woolnough, chief executive of The King's Fund, said plans to tackle the backlog in five years \"would almost certainly require a swift resolution to ongoing industrial action\".\n\nShe added: \"Addressing long waits for care will also need greater government focus on preventing ill health in the first place, and crucially, shifting more care outside of hospitals into the community so people's conditions can be managed without the need for acute care.\"\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said Labour's pledge to clear waits of more than 18 weeks within five years would be \"highly stretching\".\n\nIFS research economist Max Warner said: \"Big reductions in waiting times were made by previous Labour governments but these were alongside large increases in health spending - increases of over 7% a year in real terms.\n\n\"The challenging fiscal situation facing the next government will make it incredibly difficult to increase health spending at anywhere near similar rates, and will make achieving this commitment much harder.\"", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com",

For the last year it has hovered at under 60 per cent. Of the 7.5 million people on the waiting list for NHS treatment, 3.2 million have been waiting for more than 18 weeks.\n\nMr Streeting and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will appear on the election campaign trail together on Wednesday as the party puts its focus on the NHS.\n\nTraditionally in modern election campaigns the NHS has been a political strong suit for Labour, under whom the NHS was created in the years after the Second World War.\n\nRishi Sunak named reducing NHS waiting lists as one of his five priorities for office in a speech in January 2023. They have begun to fall in recent months but remain higher than when he took office.\n\nMr Streeting has often talked about leaning on the private healthcare sector to help clear the record waiting lists, while defending the principle that the NHS will remain free to use.\n\nSir Tony's premiership, which ran from 1997 to 2007, saw the private sector play an increased role in the NHS.\n\nMr Streeting says he wants to go further, writing: \"I first called for the NHS to use spare capacity in the private sector to bring down waiting lists two and a half years ago. Or to put it another way, five health secretaries ago. Had the Conservatives listened, an extra 270,000 people would have been treated and off waiting lists today. The last Labour government did this and delivered the shortest waits in history.\n\n\"We will go further than New Labour ever did. I want the NHS to form partnerships with the private sector that goes beyond just hospitals. Here's one example. High street opticians have the staff and equipment to provide basic tests. Meanwhile 220,000 patients have been waiting more than 18 weeks for eye care. Specsavers have welcomed Labour's plan to use high street opticians to cut waiting lists, saying they stand ready to help.\n\n\"This is how we will beat the Tory backlog - a national mission that pulls together all parts of our country to deliver it. That's the change the NHS needs. I'm appealing to Telegraph readers to give Labour a mandate to reform the NHS.\"\n\nLabour will also claim on Wednesday that the NHS waiting list will hit 10 million if the Tories remain in power. Sir Keir and Mr Streeting will point to new analysis and claim that, based on it rising by 600,000 in the 17 months since Mr Sunak became Prime Minister, it would hit 10 million after another five years at the same rate.\n\nLabour's plans to tackle record NHS waits include putting on 40,000 extra appointments each week by utilising weekend and evening slots, as well as doubling the number of scanners available to run diagnostics on patients. The initiatives will involve paying staff over-time and are set to cost the taxpayer \u00a31.3\u2009billion. It will be paid for by \"clamping down on tax dodgers and closing non-dom tax loopholes\", Labour says.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing said: \"Across NHS settings, nursing staff provide the vast majority of care but we're missing tens of thousands. Labour's plan to tackle the backlog is urgent and necessary, but it cannot simply rely on asking an already burnt-out workforce to do more with less.\"\n\nNHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: \"If political pledges are going to become a reality, trust leaders know that the next government needs to commit to sustained investment in NHS capital and digital infrastructure, staffing and social care reform - as well as resolving outstanding pay disputes and industrial action - so that patients get the timely care they deserve.\"\n\nVictoria Atkins, the Health Secretary, said: \"This is more 'copy and paste' politics from Labour, who have no plan. By contrast we published our long-term workforce plan for the NHS a year ago.\"\n\nIf Sunak cannot diagnose NHS ills, how can he cure them?\n\nBy Wes Streeting\n\nStephen served our country in the Royal Air Force. The spinal injuries he suffered during his service eventually forced him to leave the RAF on medical grounds 30 years ago, and have plagued him ever since.\n\nHe was referred for another operation on his spine, but 15 months on he is still waiting to be given a date for the surgery, forced to take daily painkillers to keep the agony at bay.\n\nDespite Stephen's service to his country, after 14 years of Conservative mismanagement, our country's health service isn't repaying our debt to Stephen. He is just one of the millions of people whose lives are put on hold while they wait for the NHS. Few can honestly say they are getting what they have been promised from the NHS.\n\nIt should not be controversial to say the NHS is failing patients today, that it is not the envy of the world, it is broken.\n\nIt is blindingly obvious to patients who routinely wait 24 hours to be seen in A&E, and the staff suffering the moral injury of seeing their patients failed. Yet Rishi Sunak won't admit it.\n\nThere has been a conspiracy of silence from the Conservatives on the NHS so far in this election campaign. A leaked copy of the party's campaign script barely mentions the NHS. The health service accounts for almost \u00a34 in every \u00a310 government departments spend day to day.\n\nIt's the \u00a3168\u2009billion elephant in the room. If Rishi Sunak cannot even diagnose the problem, how can he expect to be trusted to treat it? Voters will conclude from his silence that five more years of the Conservatives will mean nothing changes, the crisis will get worse, and the bill continues to soar in line with waiting times.\n\nAnalysis from Labour today finds that NHS waiting lists will hit 10 million, if the Conservatives are given another five years. That's 111 Wembley stadiums, full of people in need of treatment. If you lay them down, head to toe from Hadrian's Wall, they would stretch all the way to Australia. We cannot give the matches back to the arsonists who set the house on fire. It's time for change.\n\nClearing the backlog\n\nIt will be the mission of the next Labour government to clear the NHS backlog, so patients like Stephen are treated on time again. While patients today are waiting up to 18 months and longer for treatment, we will make sure the NHS treats patients within 18 weeks. This hasn't been achieved for almost a decade.\n\nOur first step will be to deliver 40,000 extra appointments a week, by running evening and weekend clinics. In the hospitals already doing this, they can get through a week's worth of procedures in a day, running side by side operating theatres like a Formula 1 pit stop. As will be the case for all our NHS policies, the \u00a31.1\u2009billion investment is tied to that reform.\n\nI first called for the NHS to use spare capacity in the private sector to bring down waiting lists two and a half years ago. Or to put it another way, five health secretaries ago. Had the Conservatives listened, an extra 270,000 people would have been treated and off waiting lists today. The last Labour government did this and delivered the shortest waits in history.\n\nWe will go further than New Labour ever did. I want the NHS to form partnerships with the private sector that goes beyond just hospitals. Here's one example. High street opticians have the staff and equipment to provide basic tests. Meanwhile 220,000 patients have been waiting more than 18 weeks for eye care.\n\nSpecsavers have welcomed Labour's plan to use high street opticians to cut waiting lists, saying they stand ready to help. This is how we will beat the Tory backlog - a national mission that pulls together all parts of our country to deliver it. That's the change the NHS needs.

We will stop the anxiety of wondering if an ambulance will come on time. We will bring back the family doctor.\n\n\"The NHS has been there for my family when we needed it. I'll make sure it's there for everyone.\"\n\nThe Labour leader said he was inspired by Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, where staff had high-intensity theatre lists on weekends up and running within six weeks.\n\nHe said: \"It was NHS staff working in the hospital I can see from my office in Parliament who led the way on this new model.\n\n\"Labour will take the best of the NHS to the rest of the NHS, so patients in every part of the country can be treated on time.\"\n\nKathryn Marszalek, senior analytical manager at the Health Foundation, warned tackling waiting lists through weekend and evening work \"must not come at a cost to staff wellbeing\".\n\nShe also called on the next government to \"provide stable, long-term investment to meet the high demand for both hospital and primary care\".\n\nEarlier this month, figures from NHS England revealed the size of the waiting list for routine hospital treatment in England was unchanged in March, following five consecutive monthly falls.\n\nAn estimated 7.54 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of March, relating to 6.29 million patients, the same numbers as in February.\n\nHowever, some 309,300 patients had been waiting more than 52 weeks to start routine hospital treatment, up from 305,050.\n\nThe number of people waiting more than 65 weeks to start treatment fell from 75,004 to 48,968.\n\nThe Government and NHS England had pledged to eliminate all waits of more than a year by March 2025, while the target to eliminate all waits of more than 65 weeks has been moved to September 2024, having previously been March 2024.\n\nThe party highlighted that Tony Blair's Labour government cut maximum waiting times from 18 months to 18 weeks.\n\nShadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \"Over 14 years the Conservatives have taken the golden inheritance left by the last Labour government and wrecked it.\n\n\"Their neglect, incompetence and underinvestment in the NHS has left millions of people waiting in pain and agony.\"\n\nHe accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of having \"given up on the NHS\" with \"no plan to turn this crisis around\".\n\n\"Patients deserve solutions not scapegoats,\" Mr Streeting added.\n\nHowever, Health Secretary Victoria Atkins described the plans as \"more 'copy and paste' politics from Labour, who have no plan\".\n\n\"Last week we exposed Labour's 'no new hospitals' pledge, in which they have said they will delay the Government's building programme for new hospitals,\" she added.\n\nMs Atkins said the health service \"has faced unprecedented challenges which it can only overcome if supported by a strong economy\".\n\nShe insisted the Conservatives \"have a clear plan and will take bold action to strengthen the economy and continue to deliver the technology and innovation the NHS needs to keep cutting waiting lists\".\n\nThea Stein, chief executive of think tank the Nuffield Trust, welcomed Labour's focus on waiting lists, but warned the estimated \u00a31.3 billion will \"cover only a limited amount of extra care\".\n\n\"Labour is right to focus on waiting lists, where progress has been slow and our analysis of the British Social Attitudes survey shows public concern is very high.\n\n\"We support the intention to spend more money on equipment, historically the victim of short-termism.\n\n\"However, the sum of money they are proposing will cover only a limited amount of extra care, not enough for a rapid or sudden improvement.\n\n\"It is unclear how more private sector capacity could be used without additional funding - or how much capacity there is left after rapid recent increases in reliance upon it.\n\n\"The problem of NHS productivity, which has fallen for complex reasons since the Covid-19 pandemic and which needs careful national leadership to tackle, also needs to be more of a priority.\"\n\nSarah Woolnough, chief executive of The King's Fund, said plans to tackle the backlog in five years \"would almost certainly require a swift resolution to ongoing industrial action\".\n\nShe added: \"Addressing long waits for care will also need greater government focus on preventing ill health in the first place, and crucially, shifting more care outside of hospitals into the community so people's conditions can be managed without the need for acute care.\"\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said Labour's pledge to clear waits of more than 18 weeks within five years would be \"highly stretching\".\n\nIFS research economist Max Warner said: \"Big reductions in waiting times were made by previous Labour governments but these were alongside large increases in health spending - increases of over 7% a year in real terms.\n\n\"The challenging fiscal situation facing the next government will make it incredibly difficult to increase health spending at anywhere near similar rates, and will make achieving this commitment much harder.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com",

For the last year it has hovered at under 60 per cent. Of the 7.5 million people on the waiting list for NHS treatment, 3.2 million have been waiting for more than 18 weeks.\n\nMr Streeting and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will appear on the election campaign trail together on Wednesday as the party puts its focus on the NHS.\n\nTraditionally in modern election campaigns the NHS has been a political strong suit for Labour, under whom the NHS was created in the years after the Second World War.\n\nRishi Sunak named reducing NHS waiting lists as one of his five priorities for office in a speech in January 2023. They have begun to fall in recent months but remain higher than when he took office.\n\nMr Streeting has often talked about leaning on the private healthcare sector to help clear the record waiting lists, while defending the principle that the NHS will remain free to use.\n\nSir Tony's premiership, which ran from 1997 to 2007, saw the private sector play an increased role in the NHS.\n\nMr Streeting says he wants to go further, writing: \"I first called for the NHS to use spare capacity in the private sector to bring down waiting lists two and a half years ago.

I'm appealing to Telegraph readers to give Labour a mandate to reform the NHS.\"\n\nLabour will also claim on Wednesday that the NHS waiting list will hit 10 million if the Tories remain in power. Sir Keir and Mr Streeting will point to new analysis and claim that, based on it rising by 600,000 in the 17 months since Mr Sunak became Prime Minister, it would hit 10 million after another five years at the same rate.\n\nLabour's plans to tackle record NHS waits include putting on 40,000 extra appointments each week by utilising weekend and evening slots, as well as doubling the number of scanners available to run diagnostics on patients. The initiatives will involve paying staff over-time and are set to cost the taxpayer \u00a31.3 billion. It will be paid for by \"clamping down on tax dodgers and closing non-dom tax loopholes\", Labour says.\n\nThe Royal College of Nursing said: \"Across NHS settings, nursing staff provide the vast majority of care but we're missing tens of thousands. Labour's plan to tackle the backlog is urgent and necessary, but it cannot simply rely on asking an already burnt-out workforce to do more with less.\"\n\nNHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: \"If political pledges are going to become a reality, trust leaders know that the next government needs to commit to sustained investment in NHS capital and digital infrastructure, staffing and social care reform - as well as resolving outstanding pay disputes and industrial action - so that patients get the timely care they deserve.\"\n\nVictoria Atkins, the Health Secretary, said: \"This is more 'copy and paste' politics from Labour, who have no plan.

That's 111 Wembley stadiums, full of people in need of treatment. If you lay them down, head to toe from Hadrian's Wall, they would stretch all the way to Australia. We cannot give the matches back to the arsonists who set the house on fire. It's time for change.\n\nIt will be the mission of the next Labour government to clear the NHS backlog, so patients like Stephen are treated on time again. While patients today are waiting up to 18 months and longer for treatment, we will make sure the NHS treats patients within 18 weeks. This hasn't been achieved for almost a decade.\n\nOur first step will be to deliver 40,000 extra appointments a week, by running evening and weekend clinics. In the hospitals already doing this, they can get through a week's worth of procedures in a day, running side by side operating theatres like a Formula 1 pit stop. As will be the case for all our NHS policies, the \u00a31.1 billion investment is tied to that reform.\n\nI first called for the NHS to use spare capacity in the private sector to bring down waiting lists two and a half years ago. Or to put it another way, five health secretaries ago. Had the Conservatives listened, an extra 270,000 people would have been treated and off waiting lists today. The last Labour government did this and delivered the shortest waits in history.\n\nWe will go further than New Labour ever did. I want the NHS to form partnerships with the private sector that goes beyond just hospitals. Here's one example. High street opticians have the staff and equipment to provide basic tests. Meanwhile 220,000 patients have been waiting more than 18 weeks for eye care.\n\nSpecsavers have welcomed Labour's plan to use high street opticians to cut waiting lists, saying they stand ready to help. This is how we will beat the Tory backlog - a national mission that pulls together all parts of our country to deliver it. That's the change the NHS needs. I'm appealing to Telegraph readers to give Labour a mandate to reform the NHS.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optician", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Streeting", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wes Streeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Health_and_Social_Care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Health and Social Care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Atkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victoria Atkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal College of Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Providers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHS Providers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHS trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Labour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industrial action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_avoidance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax avoidance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian's_Wall", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hadrian's Wall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Musculoskeletal_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Musculoskeletal Disorders", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/INy.A44ezgGznVZr1XvnHg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/2157e832df8b1e91e272f4a792107398", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605540", "eventUri": "eng-9605540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

After all, he hopes to become our next secretary of state for health and social care in a matter of weeks, and he's certainly not the quiet, retiring type.\n\nIn fact, he has a particular style of communication which has emerged over the past year or so, and I thought I'd explain what I've observed.\n\nWes Streeting is a journalist's dream, because he makes bold statements which lend themselves to the sort of inflammatory headlines which drive a huge amount of outrage, clicks, and ad revenue. Streeting has also been interviewed by a whole range of media outlets in recent months, which allegedly span the range of the political spectrum.\n\nThis, in itself, is incredibly revealing. We're meant to believe that certain media outlets have a politically progressive editorial agenda, when they're printing very similar content and opinion pieces to some proudly right-wing publications.\n\nI've been campaigning for the NHS for almost a decade now, and I've learnt that politicians have different styles when they want to convince us that they will save the NHS.\n\nFor many years now, politicians have undermined the NHS through the policies they have pushed through parliament, and through budgetary restraints that they have intentionally enacted. Meanwhile, they have enabled the proliferation of privatisation in various ways, and there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that it has helped.\n\nDuring this time, however, those in charge have been keen to tell the public that they are doing these things to help, and that their actions are in the best interests of the public and the future of the NHS.\n\nEach health secretary has taken on a different persona; a political personality.\n\nMatt Hancock liked to be seen as a nice guy. He'd tell us that he loved the NHS, and seemed to take every opportunity to associate himself with the service, in a bid to bask in the glow of its public support.\n\nSajid Javid had a tougher approach; he seemed to like pitching himself as a sensible person who was willing to have the tough conversations that others avoided.\n\nWes Streeting's persona is different to both of these, and all of the other recent health secretaries too. In fact, it's a persona which only seems to emerge in reaction to other things, other people, who he sees as threats.\n\nHe is very keen to impress upon us that he is not afraid of any of these imaginary threats, and will fight them (presumably on our behalf?).\n\nStreeting likes to tell us that he's unafraid of pushing back on trade unions, and he would like you to know that he \"won't give in\" to striking NHS workers who are fighting for a fair wage.\n\nHe received a lot of attention recently when he attacked \"middle class lefties\", who he is concerned are somehow trying to thwart his planned revival of the NHS.\n\nThose pesky trade unions, and NHS workers holding our crumbling health service together, and politically active members of our society who are advocating for an end to profit-creation within public healthcare! If any of these groups feel irksome to you, then don't worry, Streeting's on the case!\n\nHowever, the case he is actually making, when it comes down to it, is to involve more privatisation in the NHS, which he claims will help to bring down the waiting lists.\n\nThe waiting lists are terrifyingly long, even longer than they were when Rishi Sunak pledged to reduce them back in January 2023, with around 7.5 million cases currently awaiting treatment. It therefore makes perfect sense for any new government to tackle the situation.\n\nHowever, Streeting has the wrong approach.\n\nThe private healthcare sector does not have any meaningful \"spare capacity\" to save the NHS, and the vast majority of doctors working in the private healthcare sector in the UK have NHS jobs too. If Labour wins the next election and expands the workload of the private sector, this will simply result in private healthcare companies poaching (yet more) NHS staff to do the work.\n\nFor months now, NHS campaigners have been speaking up about this, because the plan simply isn't logical, and we haven't been alone.\n\nMany organisations have questioned Labour's plans, and many members of the public have been extremely vocal too. Now, even a private healthcare boss has criticised the plans. Justin Ash, the CEO of Spire Healthcare, spoke to the Times to say that Labour's plans to rely on private hospitals to bring down waiting lists is \"unlikely to work\".\n\nIf Wes Streeting wants to be taken seriously as a future health and social care secretary, and truly wants to rebuild the NHS, he needs to have a re-think.\n\nFirstly, he and Keir Starmer need to change their plans, because their bid to increase NHS privatisation isn't going to help patients.\n\nSecondly, Streeting needs to stop attacking the people who are holding the NHS together, and those fighting for its future too.", "source": {"uri": "thecanary.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Canary"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Streeting", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wes Streeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Health_and_Social_Care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Health and Social Care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Hancock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Hancock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajid_Javid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sajid Javid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Publicly funded health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Living wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Healthcare_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Healthcare Management", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Public_Art", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Public Art", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.thecanary.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-79-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605540", "eventUri": "eng-9605540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

or how much capacity there is left after rapid recent increases in reliance upon it.\n\n\"The problem of NHS productivity, which has fallen for complex reasons since the Covid-19 pandemic and which needs careful national leadership to tackle, also needs to be more of a priority.\"\n\nSarah Woolnough, chief executive of The King's Fund, said plans to tackle the backlog in five years \"would almost certainly require a swift resolution to ongoing industrial action\".\n\nShe added: \"Addressing long waits for care will also need greater government focus on preventing ill health in the first place, and crucially, shifting more care outside of hospitals into the community so people's conditions can be managed without the need for acute care.\"\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said Labour's pledge to clear waits of more than 18 weeks within five years would be \"highly stretching\".\n\nIFS research economist Max Warner said: \"Big reductions in waiting times were made by previous Labour governments but these were alongside large increases in health spending - increases of over 7% a year in real terms.\n\n\"The challenging fiscal situation facing the next government will make it incredibly difficult to increase health spending at anywhere near similar rates, and will make achieving this commitment much harder.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taxation in the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHS England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy's_and_St_Thomas'_NHS_Foundation_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Atkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victoria Atkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Health_and_Social_Care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Health and Social Care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King's Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Social_Attitudes_Survey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Social Attitudes Survey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Industrial action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Fiscal_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Institute for Fiscal Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Img38144531.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605540", "eventUri": "eng-9605540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Healthcare analysts said it was a welcome ambition but could prove tricky to meet.\n\nStreeting said he was aware of the weight of responsibility to hit the target but as someone who had been treated by the NHS for kidney cancer, it was his \"driving purpose\" to achieve it.\n\n\"I feel this enormous weight of responsibility resting on our shoulders at the moment,\" he said. \"The challenge we face today is far greater than it was in 1997.\n\n\"As someone whose life was saved by the NHS when I had kidney cancer, as someone whose family has regularly relied on the NHS in good times and bad, if there's only one thing that I do with a life that's been saved by the NHS, it's making sure that I dedicate my life to saving the NHS that saved me. And that's my driving purpose. I really hope that people give us a chance to do it.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm happy to be judged by every single pledge that we set out at this election. As I've been saying to people on the doorstep, particularly with Labour's six first steps, we've been so careful to make sure that the promises we make are promises we can keep and the country can afford. Because we know that if there's one thing that's in even shorter supply than money at the moment, it's trust.\"\n\nWhile some of the swifter patient turnaround is intended to come from a \u00a31.3bn annual funding increase, paid for in part by abolishing the non-dom tax status, much of the plan rests on modernisation and efficiency.\n\nStreeting has previously clashed with professional organisations such as the British Medical Association, the doctors' union, but he said there was willingness in the NHS to change.\n\n\"I'm talking to you in a practice up in Yorkshire, where the GP partners have led an approach that prioritises the family-doctor relationship and provides a whole range of services added value, from singing classes to help people with respiratory problems to dementia clinics,\" he said.\n\n\"There are brilliant people on the frontline. They're not resistant to change. They are crying out for it and they are desperate for a government to work with them rather than to pull the rug out from under them. So I don't feel like it's going to be me versus the NHS on NHS reform. It's going to be me with the NHS, reforming the National Health Service so that it's back on its feet and fit for the future.\"\n\nNHS waiting lists in England are gauged by a variety of metrics, depending on the time waited. The most recent figures show that among the 3.2 million people waiting more than 18 weeks, just over 300,000 have been on a waiting list for a year or more.\n\nThe total waiting list comprises about 6.3 million individuals, just over 7.5m cases. Labour will argue that on the current trajectory that would reach 10m cases in another Conservative term.\n\nWhile healthcare analysts welcomed Labour's plan, some said the proposals would fail to provide a \"rapid or sudden improvement\" in waiting times, while others said it may distract from other pressing health issues.\n\n\"Clearing the backlog within five years would take real effort and focus and may mean other ambitions in health and care will be slower to realise,\" said Sarah Woolnough, the chief executive of the King's Fund. \"Achieving this ambition to eradicate the backlog within five years would almost certainly require a swift resolution to ongoing industrial action.\"\n\nWoolnough said offering evening and weekend appointments was a good idea but it was \"not a given\" that NHS staff would be interested in doing extra shifts \"when so many report high levels of stress and burnout\".\n\nThea Stein, the chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, said Labour was right to focus on waiting lists. \"We support the intention to spend more money on equipment, historically the victim of short-termism,\" she said. \"However, the sum of money they are proposing will cover only a limited amount of extra care, not enough for a rapid or sudden improvement.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Patients can have scans and checkups before treatment starts and either be taken off of the waiting list for example if they require physio or remain on the list for further care.\n\nFigures are down from a peak of nearly 7.8 million in September and is still 3 million more than before the pandemic.\n\nSince the end of March some 43% have waited longer than 18 weeks.\n\nThe NHS target, which calls for 92% of patients to start their treatment within 18 weeks, was last hit in February 2016.\n\nCutting NHS waiting lists is also a government goal - it was one of five priorities Prime Minister Rishi Sunak set out in January 2023.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer is expected to say on Wednesday that he will take immediate steps to make more inroads into the backlog.\n\nHe will point out how in 1997 the Blair government tackled long waits and created the 18-week target.\n\n\"Putting the NHS back on its feet and making it fit for the future is personal for me,\" he will say. \"The first step of my Labour government will be to cut NHS waiting lists, clearing the Tory backlog.\"\n\nTo help achieve the goal, Labour says it will create 40,000 extra appointments, scans and operations a week during its first year, if it gains power. That is on top of the two million already carried out.\n\nThis will be done by getting the NHS to do more in the evenings and weekends, as well as making greater use of the private sector, Labour will say.\n\nThe number of scanners in the NHS will also be doubled - waiting for test results is a key bottleneck in the system.\n\nThe policy will cost \u00a31.3 billion in the first year, Labour says, and will be paid for by clamping down on tax dodgers, and closing non-dom tax loopholes.\n\nHowever, the party has yet to set out its plans for the overall budget - the previous Labour government increased spending by 6% to 7% on average. It has been half that over this parliament.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiership_of_Tony_Blair", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premiership of Tony Blair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Musculoskeletal_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Musculoskeletal Disorders", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Genitourinary_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Genitourinary Disorders", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Digestive_System_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Digestive System Disorders", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/120E6/production/_130785937_gettyimages-498722934.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605540", "eventUri": "eng-9605540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-02-", "textStart": 995, "textEnd": 1008}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

It's because he knows there's another NHS winter crisis around the corner, while strikes that he's failed to resolve are still ongoing.\"\n\nThe last two winters have seen two of the worst crises for the NHS on record, with beds taken up by patients suffering the effects of flu and Covid.\n\nBut Mr Streeting is also the face of one of the top six pledges - or first steps - on Sir Keir Starmer's pledge card promising to bring in an extra 40,000 appointments a week.\n\nAsked how he would describe the sort of health secretary he wants to become, Mr Streeting said: \"I will be a shop steward for patients as health secretary.\"\n\nHe acknowledges that while plans to use spare capacity from private medical providers and introducing weekend working on a voluntary basis will help bring down waiting lists, he will need to end the strikes to resolve the crisis.\n\nMr Streeting claimed he suspects the Tories are using the strikes as an election tactic.\n\n\"I think it suits the prime minister that there are people out on strike because he can blame the staff for the fact he hasn't kept his waiting list pledge rather than take responsibility. I think that is the hallmark of this prime minister - blame other people, takes no responsibility himself.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Streeting, a former National Union of Students president whose family were Tories on his father's side and Labour on his mother's, is not afraid to bring together the two political traditions.\n\nThis includes his plan to use private health companies to bring down waiting lists, a policy which has angered many on the left.\n\nBut he is unrepentant: \"I think what a lot of my critics can't answer is the consequences of their convictions. If you're saying to me, we shouldn't use spare capacity in the private sector to bring down NHS waiting lists, what you're basically saying is that working-class people who can't afford to pay for those appointments, they should be waiting longer because of your principles.\"\n\nHe recently also annoyed some Labour activists by defending the decision to keep the two-child cap on child benefits even though he admits in his book that his mother needed benefits to put food on the table and coins in the electricity meter.\n\nHe said that \"handouts\" are not the solution to tackling poverty.\n\nMr Streeting disavowed students protesting over Gaza - \"you wouldn't have seen me in one of those tents when I was at the NUS\".\n\nHe defended right-wing Dover MP Natalie Elphicke defecting to Labour.\n\nAnd he appears to be set on another clash over the junior doctors' strike where he has made clear their pay demands will not be met - or at least, not immediately.\n\n\"I need to be upfront with people on this side of the election. So I'm not prepared to sit here and say to junior doctors, 'Your 35 per cent pay demand, don't worry, you'll be alright with Labour', and then let them down on the other side of the election.\n\n\"I think one of the reasons why we've seen so many staff striking in such great numbers, is not just because demands haven't been met, but actually the lack of respect and care they've been shown. So I know it's a hard message for junior doctors to hear when I say we can't afford 35 per cent at this stage.\n\n\"But I think contained in that honesty is the respect that junior doctors deserve, because I want to work with them if we're in government in a way in which we're honest with each other and respectful. And so I've said the journey to fair pay is exactly that. It's a journey, not an event, we will have to negotiate on pay and beyond pay.\"\n\nHe pointed out that there were other problems, including junior doctors choosing where they work or extreme cases like one not being able to change work times when a partner is diagnosed with cancer or another not being able to ask for time off a year in advance to get married.\n\nMr Streeting is collecting evidence of the experiences many health professionals, including junior doctors and nurses, are treated.\n\n\"The NHS has been running on a hell of a lot of goodwill for quite a long time on services.

NHS waiting lists hit 7.5million in England in March - and Labour analysis suggests it could balloon further to 10million if the Tories win another term in office.\n\nThis is despite Rishi Sunak making slashing waiting lists one of his five pledges to voters in 2023. In his first newspaper interview of the General Election campaign, Mr Starmer said it was \"unforgivable\" that the Tories had run the NHS down over 14 years - and vowed to fix it.\n\nHe told the Mirror: \"We've done it before and we'll do it again. At the end of that exercise under the last Labour Government, satisfaction in the NHS was the highest it's ever been.\n\n\"Tragically now it's at the lowest, and for someone whose wife works in the NHS, whose mum worked in the NHS and relied on the NHS, it breaks my heart that they have so damaged our NHS that public satisfaction in something that people hold very dear in this country is at an all-time low.\"\n\nLabour has vowed to create 40,000 extra appointments, scans, and operations each week to slash the NHS backlog within five years. It would also double the number of scanners in a bid to diagnose patients earlier.\n\nMr Starmer said he was inspired by the work of staff at Guys and St Thomas' Hospital, across the river from his Commons office, where staff run high-intensity theatre lists at weekend. This allows medics to do up to a week's worth of procedures in specialities like orthopaedics or ear, nose, and throat in a single eight-hour shift.\n\nSpeaking on a campaign visit to Derby, the Labour leader said: \"This has to be done with NHS staff, not to NHS staff, so we won't do what this Government does and bash and blame NHS staff. We will work with them on this. The team at St Thomas' that have already done this will be a crack team that we will use going across the country to work with us to set this up at speed.\"\n\nLabour would get cracking on this on its first day in office if Mr Starmer wins the keys to No10. He added: \"Eight million is shocking. That means that for Mirror readers, almost everybody reading the Mirror or somebody in their family or friends, somebody they know will be on a waiting list. That is huge discomfort and pain and real harm.\"\n\nMr Starmer said he was often approached by members of the public about the state of the NHS, describing a woman with an ingrown eyelid who approached him at a train station to say she'd been waiting 18 months for an operation - and now faced another year's wait.\n\n\"That's the human cost of this Government's chaos and lack of grip on the NHS,\" he said. He recalled the pride his mum had when she worked as a nurse, saying: \"I understand that pride and that complete desire to deliver the best possible care to their patients and the complete frustration that NHS staff would be put in this position by the Government.\"\n\nMr Starmer will bang the drum for Labour's plans on a campaign visit to the West Midlands on Wednesday with Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting.\n\nStarmer vows to act on vile online content\n\nLabour would act quickly to protect children from harmful content online, Keir Starmer has said.\n\nThe Labour leader expressed alarm at some of the vile material youngsters are bombarded with by algorithms, which include posts on suicide and eating disorders. A poll for the Mirror found a majority of voters think social media firms should be forced to stop children seeing harmful content almost immediately.\n\nThe survey found 60% want this to happen by the end of July, while a further 22% said it should be before the end of this year. Only 2% were against it.\n\nAsked about the findings, the dad-of-two told the Mirror: \"It is a concern to me. Looking at some of the material that is available would shock, not only to any parent or carer but anybody who looked at these things reasonably and objectively.\n\n\"It does require us to work at pace with those that provide the platforms in terms of the content that is being provided. So yes, we would seek to get to grips with that very quickly if we're privileged enough to come to serve.\"\n\nRishi Sunak branded 'tax risers' tax riser'\n\nKeir Starmer has branded Rishi Sunak the \"tax risers' tax riser\" and demanded to know why anyone should believe Tory promises.\n\nThe Labour leader gave short shrift to the Conservative commitment to give a \u00a32.4billion tax break to the 8 million working pensioners. The promised increase in the income tax personal allowance would be a cut of around \u00a395 in 2025-26, rising to \u00a3275 in 2029-30, under the plans.\n\nBut Mr Starmer told the Mirror: \"This is a government that has raised taxes more than any other government. We've got the highest tax burden since the war. They went into the last election promising they wouldn't put taxes up, and they've put them up more than anybody else.\n\n\"And the person who has put them up is Rishi Sunak, as Chancellor and Prime Minister. He is the tax risers' tax riser, the British expert on tax rises. So why would anyone believe them? It's absolutely desperate stuff.\"\n\nLabour has committed to the pensions triple lock but has not backed the Tories plans.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lizzy_buchan@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lizzy Buchan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas'_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Thomas' Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Secretary_of_State_for_Health_and_Social_Care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shadow Secretary of State for Health and Social Care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Streeting", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wes Streeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of the Exchequer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32911899.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2SOCIAL-IMAGE-Mirror-exclusive-right-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605540", "eventUri": "eng-9605540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Unfortunately for him, Labour's attack will soon be focused on an issue many voters regard as even more important, and where there is no such sense of improvement - the National Health Service.\n\nLabour has always regarded the NHS as its own, even though it was not Aneurin Bevan but Winston Churchill who as prime minister originally embraced the idea of a national health service free at the point of use and set the process in motion for its creation.\n\nNonetheless, it is perfectly true that in terms of its founding principles, the NHS is about as socialist an institution as they come. Not even China has anything remotely similar. The torch of communist idealism may have died in just about every other walk of life, but it still burns bright in UK healthcare.\n\nDespite record-high waiting lists, a series of shaming scandals and growing evidence that outcomes are falling badly behind alternative forms of universal healthcare, public faith in the NHS remains remarkably strong.\n\nThe British were never happier than when banging their saucepans on doorsteps up and down the land during the pandemic in praise of our heroic NHS.\n\nThere seems to be almost no outrage or failing so great that it significantly undermines this affection. Survey after survey shows overwhelming public support for the NHS's underlying model and principles.\n\nVoters surely want to see improvement, but they don't on the whole want to see the NHS abolished and replaced with something else. Any politician that even remotely suggests alternatives can expect a severe beating at the polls.\n\nEven Reform UK, which has some quite out there and wholly unrealistic proposals for dealing with waiting lists and staffing deficiencies, shrinks from challenging the free at the point of use principle.\n\nBut here's the point: though Labour will use every opportunity to weaponise the NHS against the Tories, it seems to be as clueless as the Government itself over what to do about this obviously failing institution.\n\nBeyond the same old promises of getting waiting lists down, improved access to primary care, better early diagnosis of cancer, a bit more money and some un-transformational tinkering with structure, there is literally nothing of substance it's got to contribute.\n\nLabour has chosen well in Wes Streeting as its shadow health secretary. It would be hard to find a more plausible and obviously decent spokesman.\n\nHe is also spot on in diagnosing some of the NHS's underlying pathologies.\n\n\"The NHS is a service, not a shrine\", he wrote in a newspaper article at the weekend. The cover up of the contaminated blood scandal is indicative of \"a cultural rot that places protecting the reputation of the NHS above protecting the public\", and he promised \"a decade of change and modernisation\" that would put the patient first and the organisation second.\n\nYet he failed to draw the obvious conclusion from his analysis, which is that to transform the NHS from a national religion into a well-performing service industry. The Government must first change the funding model, so that patients can see some kind of a link between what they pay and what they receive.\n\nIt's true that this doesn't necessarily lead to improvement; as we have seen with the privatised water utilities, overtly paying for something is no guarantee of acceptable standards of service.\n\nEven so, the social insurance model for universal healthcare widely practised on the Continent does seem to deliver rather better outcomes, both in standards of service and as a mechanism for enabling higher levels of funding. People generally don't mind paying a bit more tax if they can see it hypothecated into something tangible for their money.\n\nI don't know enough about the policy debate of the immediate post-war period to understand why healthcare was not included in the National Insurance system established to pay for other forms of social welfare. But in any case, healthcare has been substantially paid for out of general taxation ever since the NHS was established.\n\nThere have been one or two attempts along the way to bring NHS spending into the National Insurance (NI) net - one under Gordon Brown, who partially paid for a big rise in healthcare spending via an increase in NI contributions, then a few years back via the ill-fated Health and Social Care Levy.\n\nBut neither attempt led to anything: NI has never achieved the status of continental style social insurance, and is today widely regarded as just an additional form of income tax. The contributory principle hasn't meant anything for a long time now.\n\nAs it is, the NHS has to take its place against other spending priorities, limping hopelessly from one cash-starved crisis to the next in an age when rising healthcare expectations and the challenges of an ageing society threaten still greater disappointments to come.\n\nOnly Labour can realistically hope to initiate the necessary root and branch reform; for the Tories, any such undertaking would be electoral suicide. But there is no appetite for it in a party which despite its Blairite pretensions remains as wedded to the socialist underpinnings of this public sector leviathan as ever.\n\nSo we beat on, in the words immortalised by F.

The package would be funded through \"clamping down on tax dodgers and closing non-dom tax loopholes,\" it said.\n\n\"The first step of my Labour government will be to cut NHS waiting lists, clearing the Tory backlog,\" Labour's leader Keir Starmer said in the statement, ahead of a campaign event in the West Midlands on Wednesday where he will discuss the plans. \"We will roll up our sleeves to work with NHS staff, not against them.\"\n\nThe length of waiting lists in the NHS is a sensitive issue for the governing Conservatives given that cutting them was one of five key pledges made by Sunak last year. Though waiting lists have been falling in recent months, the number of patients waiting for treatment still remains higher than when Sunak made the pledge.\n\nA key part of the problem for Sunak has been waves of strikes from junior and senior doctors -- known as consultants -- that have led to more than a million appointments being canceled, driving waiting lists up further.\n\nLabour said its pledge is focused on clearing the current list of 3.2 million patients who've been waiting for more than 18 weeks for treatment. The total waiting list of patients stands at approximately 7.5 million, according to latest data.\n\nRead More: Inside Sunak's Hail-Mary Plan to Narrow Poll Gap With Labour (1)\n\nLabour's plans would also include \"the biggest expansion of NHS staff in history\" and using spare capacity in the private sector free of charge for patients, it said.\n\nLabour's pitch on the NHS comes with the election campaign in full swing ahead of the vote on July 4. The first opinion polls since campaigning begun suggest no clear change to the electoral picture so far, with Labour still enjoying double-digit leads of more than 20 points in some cases, suggesting Starmer is on course to be the next prime minister.\n\nSunak's Tories have tried to seize the momentum in the early campaigning with eye-catching policy announcements such as introducing mandatory National Service and cutting tax for pensioners, part of a strategy to focus on its core, right-wing, older vote in a bid to narrow the gap with Labour.

His shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves on Tuesday promised to deliver \"a government that is pro-worker and pro-business, in the knowledge that each depends upon the success of the other\".\n\nAnd Ms Reeves's plan will mean those earning less than the \u00a3123 a week earnings threshold, who are currently ineligible, will be able to claim statutory sick pay. Labour will also let workers claim the payment immediately, scrapping a four-day waiting period before they can access it.\n\nAhead of officially unveiling the plans on Wednesday, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: \"Britain is stuck in a sickness doom loop. Low paid and insecure workers - most of them women - are forced to work through illness or go without financial support when sick.\n\n\"The Tories have failed to fix Britain's broken sick pay system, and this is adding to NHS backlogs, hitting productivity and harming the working people who keep our country moving.\n\n\"Labour will be laser-focused on tackling the problem of sickness at work, strengthening statutory sick pay and scrapping the lower earnings limit.\n\n\"The New Deal for Working People is Labour's plan to make work pay and deliver employment protections fit for a modern economy.\"\n\nIt comes after Labour used the first full week of the campaign to unveil more details on how it plans to deliver on its New Deal for Working People.\n\nIn government, Labour has pledged to tackle the issues that affect working families and \"turn the page on 14 years of Tory neglect\".\n\nAhead of the election being called, Sir Keir and senior members of his shadow cabinet had a meeting with union bosses where they were forced to commit to the workers' rights package.\n\nSir Keir denied watering down policies in areas such as zero-hours contracts, parental leave and sick pay. It followed a row over reports the package would go through a consultation process with businesses, potentially delaying or limiting its impact.\n\nThe Independent has previously reported that women are more than twice as likely as men to miss out on statutory payments due to the lower earnings limit.\n\nLabour's plan would scrap the limit, opening access to sick pay to an estimated 1.5 million workers.\n\nPaul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the change was long overdue and everyone should have access to sick pay.\n\nHe added: \"But many low-paid workers are forced to go without sick pay when they are ill. This is a scandal and totally counterproductive.\n\n\"If people cannot afford to stay home when they're sick, they will take their infections in to work and put others at risk.\n\n\"Strengthening sick pay is good for workers, businesses and public health.\"\n\nIt comes after Ms Reeves unveiled the backing of 121 business leaders for Labour, but promised to maintain the party's focus on \"delivering for working people\".\n\nAt a speech in Derby, the shadow chancellor said: \"Under Keir's leadership, we have changed the Labour Party so that we may have the chance to change our country for the better.\n\n\"To offer a government that is pro-worker and pro-business, in the knowledge that each depends upon the success of the other.\n\n\"This Labour Party understands that business success is crucial to good jobs, and good work is crucial to successful businesses.\"\n\nNotable signatories of the letter endorsing Labour include Tory donor Sir Malcolm Walker, the founder of Iceland, who signed a similar letter supporting Conservative economic policy ahead of the 2015 general election.\n\nSir Malcolm's son Richard Walker, the supermarket chain's managing director who previously sought a Conservative seat for this election, also signed the letter.\n\nIt comes as Sir Keir and shadow health secretary Wes Streeting will use a visit to the West Midlands to promise to clear the waiting list of patients who have been waiting for more than 18 weeks, within five years.\n\nShadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \"Over 14 years the Conservatives have taken the golden inheritance left by the last Labour government and wrecked it.\n\n\"Their neglect, incompetence and underinvestment in the NHS has left millions of people waiting in pain and agony.\"\n\nHe accused Rishi Sunak of having \"given up on the NHS\" with \"no plan to turn this crisis around\".\n\n\"Patients deserve solutions not scapegoats,\" Mr Streeting added.\n\nIf it wins the general election, Labour says it will initially focus on reducing treatment backlogs, currently at 7.54 million.\n\nThe party claims the figure could rise to 10 million if the Conservatives are in office for another five years.\n\nLabour's first step would be to create an additional 40,000 appointments, scans and operations each week during evenings and weekends.\n\nIt also vowed to double the numbers of scanners in a bid to diagnose patients earlier.\n\nSir Keir said: \"Putting the NHS back in its feet and making it fit for the future is personal for me.\n\n\"It runs through my family like a stick of rock, which is why one of my five missions is to turn it around after 14 years of Conservative decline.\n\n\"The first step of my Labour government will be to cut NHS waiting lists, clearing the Tory backlog.\"",

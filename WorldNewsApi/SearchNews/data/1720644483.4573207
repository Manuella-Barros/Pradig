Ridiculous Holland rant (Re: \u2018Let the planet burn\u2019; Health minister off the rails with road trip rant, June 1.) This rant by federal health minister Mark Holland equating family road trips with destroying the planet would be laughable if Holland weren\u2019t serious. The guy seems completely out of touch with reality. If this little rant by a cabinet minister doesn\u2019t signify that it\u2019s time for a new federal government, I don\u2019t know what will. Perhaps once Holland loses his seat in the House, he can cower in his home and sob in terror at the looming demise of our planet due to climate change. Mike Shurtliff (It was a ridiculous take.) Pierre\u2019s not perfect, but\u2026 Pierre Poilievre is likely to be Canada\u2019s next prime minister, with a majority government, after the next election. Is he a perfect politician? Absolutely not. I do not believe that Pierre and the Conservatives are going to create a Canadian utopia where every decision is right for Canada and without unintended consequences. Every politician, regardless of party, is, after all, a human being with all of the potential failings that come with being human. In Pierre\u2019s case, I take comfort knowing that he comes not from a privileged, entitled background, but one that is far more in tune with what the government is doing and how it affects the average Canadian.

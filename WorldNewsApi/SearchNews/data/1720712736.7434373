(Photo by Gene Wang/Getty Images) Getty Images Nvidia stock has soared to about $1,200 a share \u2014 up some 287% since the chip designer\u2019s boffo May 2023 earnings report kindled generative AI fever. With the stock set to drop to about $120 per share Monday \u2014 when the company\u2019s 10-for-1 split goes into effect \u2014 will its rise back to $1,200? Here are four reasons that could happen by 2026 \u2014 the first is new, and the last three are still valid since my May Forbes post: Companies are afraid of falling behind in the race to master generative AI \u2014 as evidenced by $10 billion in Nvidia\u2019s new sovereign AI revenue, according to the Wall Street Journal, Nvidia\u2019s great performance and prospects; Nvidia\u2019s successful growth investments; and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s leadership \u2014 which could also be Nvidia\u2019s biggest investment risk should he leave the job without a more capable successor. One other risk is business leaders\u2019 bipolar attitude towards generative AI. How so? CEOs\u2019 battling fears \u2014 being left behind the generative AI boom and an AI hallucination savaging their company\u2019s reputation \u2014 could make it difficult for them to discover any high payoff generative AI applications, as I wrote in my new book, Brain Rush: How to Invest and Compete in the Real World of Generative AI. Without that, demand for Nvidia\u2019s technology could be difficult to sustain.

Here is a new source of growth to fuel that rise: governments in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the Americas are buying GPUs en masse as they build domestic computing facilities for artificial intelligence, noted the Journal. What is driving this spending? The desire by countries to develop AI by training large language models in their own language with citizens\u2019 data. Underlying this sovereign generative AI imperative is \u201ca quest for more strategic self-reliance amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China,\u201d the Journal wrote. Nvidia expects such sovereign AI spending to account for $10 billion in 2024 revenue, the company said last month. If demand by countries to build their own generative AI capabilities continues to expand, such spending could help Nvidia to diversify its revenue sources in the future. Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, but there are other ways Nvidia could continue to profit from the AI boom. \u201cThe question has been, how can they continue this momentum?\u201d he told the Journal. \u201cSovereign AI is a new lever out there in terms of generating higher revenue.\u201d Three Nvidia Growth Drivers In addition to sovereign AI demand for Nvidia chips, other drivers of Nvidia\u2019s growth, about which I wrote in my May Forbes post, include: Expectations-beating first-quarter results and forecast. In the first quarter of the company\u2019s fiscal year 2025, Nvidia beat expectations for 237% growth by $1.78 billion and reported higher than expected gross margin of 78.4%, noted Yahoo! Finance. The company also forecast 197% growth for the current quarter \u2014 exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations, according to the Journal. Nvidia\u2019s Growth Investments. Nvidia\u2019s aggressive pace annual pace of new product introductions will drive future growth, Examples include Blackwell chips which Huang said would generate \u201calot of revenue\u201d for Nvidia in 2024 along with the company\u2019s fast-growing InfiniBand line, as I wrote in May. Nvidia\u2019s 427% increase in revenue from cloud service providers \u2014 which accounted for $22.6 billion in revenue, noted the New York Times, could slow down in the future. Fortunately for Nvidia, demand from sovereign AI customers could help offset the inevitable maturation of GPU demand from cloud services providers. Huang\u2019s world-class leadership talent. Huang is at the top of a very elite class of leaders who founded a company that went public and maintained control more than three years after the company\u2019s IPO, I noted in May. His ability to introduce and sell industry-leading GPUs while surfing new waves of demand is exceptionally valuable. The company\u2019s ability to sustain expectations-beating growth depends on him remaining CEO \u2014 and ultimately appointing a successor at least as talented as Huang. Can Companies Find High Payoff Generative AI Applications? Based on my interviews with dozens of business leaders, generative AI in companies is caught in a bipolar battle, according to Brain Rush. Peer pressure forces CEOs to tell Wall Street how generative AI will transform their business. At the same time, CEOs are terrified the AI chatbots will hallucinate \u2014 thus damaging their company's reputation. For instance, Google's AI advised people to add glue to pizza. And Air Canada's AI chatbot made up a refund policy for a customer \u2014 and a Canadian tribunal forced the airline to issue a real refund based on its AI-invented policy. This bipolar battle has significant implications for business. Of 200 to 300 generative AI experiments companies are developing, they have rolled out only 10 to 15 internally, and released perhaps one or two to customers and other stakeholders, according to my June 3 interview with Liran Hason, CEO of Aporia, a Manhattan-based startup offering guardrails to protect companies from AI hallucinations. Unless high payoff applications of generative AI emerge from this process of experimentation, the wave of demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs could taper off over the long run. In the meantime, business and political leaders\u2019 fear of falling behind in the generative AI race could drive high demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Ten days ago, a hastily convened Nine board meeting to deal with the runaway scandal surrounding Nine\u2019s response to a series of harassment allegations against senior television executive Darren Wick had many stakeholders convinced that Sneesby\u2019s days as CEO were numbered. However, Sneesby survived in what could be described as a near (corporate) death experience. To have done so, Sneesby needed the support of chairman Costello, and the chairman needed most Nine\u2019s non-executive directors to fall into line. The board then put out a detailed statement after that meeting that included the announcement of an external review. It also promised to put the safety of staff as a top priority and it openly encouraged whistleblowers and promised a cultural overhaul.", "summary": "Those who believe taking the chairman\u2019s scalp will allow a sigh of relief that the crisis has been averted should watch this space.", "url": "https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/costello-exit-not-the-silver-bullet-for-nine-s-board-20240609-p5jkep.html", "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.17930017414493127%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/1a6dde1770de588adb8a6f3920cf48e0970bf7a3", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:15:00", "author": "Elizabeth Knight", "authors": ["Elizabeth Knight"], "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": -0.466}

To get his hands on the biggest trophy in the country, he will have to get past the club where his dad is a club legend.\n\nWilkinson grew up in and around Elland Road and the Leeds training ground, relishing the chance to get in his seat at 2pm on a Saturday and watch the stadium fill up, seeing legendary players and managers on a regular basis.\n\nALSO READ: I had trials at Manchester United - but Man City did 'proper' sessions so I signed for them instead\n\nALSO READ: Jadon Sancho and Champions League stars give easy inspiration for Man City's FA Youth Cup final\n\n\"I was desperate to be a footballer. But it was the intrigue,\" he says ahead of the biggest game of his coaching career. \"Without the childhood experiences I had then maybe I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing now. But that was just what life was.\n\n\"As a young boy you're going to Premier League games every weekend, watching top teams and being fortunate enough to be in the company of unbelievable people. And almost thinking it's normal I guess.\n\n\"I look back on it now very fondly and feel grateful I had that experience. My dad counted the likes of Dave Bassett, Jim Smith, Trevor Francis, Sir Alex Ferguson as friends and peers. I'll always remember being in the car, and you'd have that massive car phone [talking to them]. I'd be dialling the number sometimes. You just listen. Never say anything.\n\n\"When I got a little bit older you'd sneak into the dressing room for pre-season games. One at Rotherham where I heard a few words I'd never heard before! I was in awe of those players. I went to so many games. Home and away, Europe a couple of years.\"\n\nWilkinson's dad is Howard Wilkinson, former Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday boss, as well as England caretaker on a couple of occasions. He won the top flight at Elland Road - the last title before the Premier League came in - before spending the end of his career as Technical Director at the FA where he played a key role in the establishment of St George's Park.\n\nThat upbringing made football the only option in his mind for a future career, but his dreams of playing never really took off, so he quickly turned to following in his father's footsteps when it came to coaching.\n\nAfter an apprenticeship at Derby, Wilkinson moved to Hull, but injured his cruciate ligament days after making his debut in the Championship. A loan at Gretna followed - 'an unbelievable experience from the bottom to the top, a crazy football club' - as well as spells at York and Chester. The irony isn't lost that both Gretna and Chester went out of business when he was there.\n\n\"There was something telling me that this wasn't quite working and it wasn't due to my wages!\" he laughs. \"I knew by that point I wasn't on the track that I hoped I was going to be on. I made the decision around 22, 23, to try and start my coaching badges. I was playing at Boston and there was a game or two where I came off at half time and I thought: that's it. I need to change now and start [coaching] so by the time that I am mid-thirties I am in a better position than I am now.\"\n\n\"When I got my injury it was really bad timing because at the time I thought I was doing really well and just on the cusp of something. But not in the end. I didn't stop because of my knee. My knee was fine. It was more about the level I was at.\n\n\"I was struggling to be where I wanted to be and I looked at the structure of lower league football and it was one-year contracts, the money and security wasn't great. I thought if I am going to be doing this for ten years I am not going to be in a great position at the end of it so I had a passion for coaching, loved the game so I thought I would be better off putting my energy into that.\"\n\nWilkinson began coaching at boyhood club Sheffield Wednesday, starting at under-12 level and moving his way up to the youth team. He was driving the bus, collecting balls, recruiting players, and earning as little as \u00a330 per session at times to the point where he had to live at home with his parents to get by. He even took a job at a sports software company which focussed on recording data for players in a centralised database.\n\nWilkinson had retired by the age of 24, and after progressing at Sheffield Wednesday, City came calling in 2018. He was under-23s assistant, then under-16 coach, then three years ago became under-18 head coach. Despite being blown away by the talent in the under-16s on his first day, two under-18 league titles have followed, and this year could see him add the Youth Cup to his collection.\n\nHaving seen how difficult it is to become a player, Wilkinson chooses his moments to pass on his own experience and 'bring players back down to earth' if they need it.\n\n\"They're still one million miles away from cracking it but they maybe sometimes get that feeling that they're nearly there,\" he says. \"Part of our job is to bring them back down to earth and make sure they're aware of what the reality looks like that. That might be through us doing it or a loan move. Players who've had failed loan moves have learned more in that six months of not playing than they would have done in four or five years here, winning things and being the best player.\n\n\"Sometimes you have a group who might be going through a bit of a patch and you have to remind them of their responsibilities and what the real world could look like in no time at all. It's something you know that if you need to you can pull it out but you hope it's not going to be too often.\"\n\nFriday night will see Wilkinson take charge of the biggest game of his coaching career, and victory will justify the bold decision to cut short his playing career to move into coaching almost a decade earlier than most would even think of.\n\nIn the stands at the Etihad will be his parents, who follow his City games online whenever they can't be there in person. But will there be any part of dad Howard looking out for his former club on Friday, rather than Ben's City youngsters?\n\nWilkinson replies: \"My mum wouldn't let him support anyone else! My mate is often at games sat next to my mum and dad. He says it's quite funny, they get into it which I would have never have thought given the amount of games they've seen in their lives.\n\n\"My mum probably makes me more nervous than dad - I'm scared of her! I like it. I remember him being down there [on the touchline] for years and me and mum being upstairs, now it's the other way round. They enjoy it in terms of the continuity with the family too.\n\n\"Apparently he gets quite into it. They sit on the iPad on the weekend watching games, swearing in the kitchen and stuff.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"},

The younger Wilkinson leading youngsters in an FA Youth Cup final, the standard of quality on offer in part down to a vision the elder Wilkinson - among others - made sure was a blueprint for future success in developing players.\n\nAnd it's against Leeds United, no less. Ben grew up in awe of Howard at Leeds, bobbing in and out of dressing rooms - making sure he was sat in his Elland Road seat at 2pm on matchdays so not to miss anything - as his old man conquered the game. Still the last Englishman to win the league, Wilkinson.\n\nIn 1992. Ben was five then. As he grew older, there were regular trips to Thorp Arch during half term, absorbing training sessions. A budding midfielder, he became obsessed with coaching.\n\n'I was intrigued as to what happened between Saturdays, all that time in between,' he says. 'Why was my dad never at home? Then the more I saw that the more it opened my eyes. Dad was massive as a kid and without those experiences maybe I wouldn't be here now. You're fortunate enough to be in the company of unbelievable people - and almost thinking it's normal.'\n\nCome on, name names then.\n\n'The likes of Dave Bassett, Jim Smith, Trevor Francis, Sir Alex Ferguson he would count as friends. These people would make regular phone calls.\n\n'I'll always remember being in the car, and you'd have that massive car phone. I'd be dialling the number sometimes. I don't know how you actually drove looking back!\n\nWilkinson's dad Howard is the last English manager to win the league with Leeds in 1992\n\n'I just listened. Never said anything. When I got a little bit older I'd sneak into the dressing room for pre-season games, once at Rotherham where I heard a few words I'd never heard before! I was in awe of those players. I went to so many games. Home and away, Europe a couple of years. Amazing.'\n\nWilkinson Jnr almost made it as a player. A Championship debut for Hull City as a teenager, he went and ruptured his cruciate in the reserves days later. He ended up packing the game in at 23, although not solely down to injuries. 'I had the unfortunate position of being at Chester and Gretna when both clubs went bankrupt,' Ben says. 'And it wasn't due to my wages! So there was something telling me that this wasn't quite working.\n\n'I was at Boston United and there was a game or two where I came off at half time and I thought: that's it. I need to change now and start [coaching] so by the time that I am mid-thirties I am in a better position than I am now.'\n\nNot a bad position, too. After starting his coaching journey with boyhood club Sheffield Wednesday - earning \u00a330 a session, driving the bus, sourcing the balls, while moving back into the family home - Ben is now one of the country's preeminent academy coaches at 37 and can deliver the club's second Youth Cup in four years. Cole Palmer, James McAtee, Morgan Rogers and a few others starred that night in 2020, against Chelsea, so it's worth paying attention to this lot.\n\nAnd the man coaching them too. Ben started at City six years ago, first an Under-23 assistant before taking the Under-16 job in 2020, where he helped mould Rico Lewis. He won the Under-18 title last season with an inexperienced group at that level and will finish second this time after a year plagued by injuries and seeing his best players promoted to the Under 21s.\n\nCole Palmer and Morgan Rogers were among the stars in City's FA Youth Cup success in 2020\n\n'I remember my first day with the 16s, I was unbelievably nervous,' he admits. 'I was keen to impress, I had points in my head and within 10 minutes I was ripping it up because they were miles ahead of that.\n\n'You can get into a false sense of security at a monster club like this one. Players can easily get carried away with being in this environment and having these facilities, having the access to the coaches.\n\n'You might get called up to train with the first team but they're still a million miles away from cracking it. But they maybe sometimes get that feeling that they're nearly there. Part of our job is to bring them back down to earth and make sure they're aware of what the reality looks like that.'\n\nFortunately for the younger Wilkinson, his rounded journey takes in both realities of professional sport.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Wilkinson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Wilkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C._EDS_and_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C.

I wasn't cooking then, but I knew the kitchen was a comforting place,\" said Wilkinson.\n\nThe book pays tribute to those kitchen ghosts, the spirit of five generations of black country cooks in Wilkinson's family.\n\nPeople like her Granny Christine, who, after she passed away in the 90s, Wilkinson missed terribly during the holidays.\n\nIt was her grandmother's dress that helped her cook that first holiday without her.\n\n\"I went back into the bedroom where I had one of her dresses and I brought it out and hung it up on the doorway in the back of my kitchen and you know I thought it felt like she was there,\" said Wilkinson.\n\nWilkinson has traveled the country promoting her new book.\n\nReading to the crowd, she said, \"There is cornbread in my blood. I can make it in my sleep,\" said Wilkinson.\n\nShe often refers to the book as a love song to Appalachia and the importance of the African American influence on it.\n\nThe cover of her book features who she believes to be the daughter of her ancestor Aggy who was enslaved and later became a free woman married to the white man who owned her.\n\nIt was family history she learned while researching the book.\n\nIt's those deeply personal stories she gets to now share with others.\n\n\"Women have not always had a voice, and black women have not always had a voice, and to be able to give a voice to these women on the page, for them to be country, black, ordinary women who are standing up in some ways on the page,\" said Wilkinson.\n\nWilkinson has spent her life writing about what she knows: the kitchen.\n\nIt is a place she calls home.\n\n\"So, I think food is unifying and stories are unifying,\" said Wilkinson\n\nAnd it's a place she hopes continues to bring us together, oftentimes with our own kitchen ghosts looking over us.\n\nWilkson's new book is published by Clarkson Potter.\n\nYou can find her new book at your local bookstore and online.\n\nCrystal Wilkinson was Kentucky's Poet Laureate from 2021 to 2023.\n\nShe is the award-winning author of Perfect Black;

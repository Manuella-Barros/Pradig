Thanks to President Biden and Vice President Harris's Investing in America agenda, since they took office, companies have announced more than $170 billion in investments in electric vehicle (EV) and battery supply chain manufacturing, making the U.S. the global leader for EV manufacturing investment, and the U.S. auto industry has added over 250,000 jobs, after losing 90,000 jobs under the previous Administration. More than 20 auto and battery plants have been announced under President Biden and Vice President Harris, after no new net plants were opened under the previous Administration.\n\nHistoric contracts secured by the United Auto Workers with the Big 3 Detroit automakers -- Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis -- as well as recent organizing victories like at Volkswagen in Chattanooga, Tennessee, ensure that these jobs of the future will provide comparable wages, retirement security, and respect at work.\n\nTo ensure that the future of the auto industry is made in America by American autoworkers, today, Vice President Harris will announce:\n\nMore than $100 million in funding for small- and medium-sized auto parts manufacturers to expand or retool manufacturing facilities:\n\nThe Department of Energy will set aside $50 million of its Automotive Conversion Grants Program for partnerships with states to help small- and medium-sized suppliers convert from manufacturing internal combustion engine parts to manufacturing parts for the EV supply chain. This funding will maintain the Domestic Conversion Grant's same focus on supporting retooling to keep good, good-paying and union jobs in the same communities as automakers and auto suppliers transition to electric vehicle manufacturing here in America. The Department of Energy recently requested public input on the design of these state-federal partnerships in order to best support small- and medium-sized manufacturers in the auto supply chain.\n\nThe Department of Energy is setting aside up to $50 million of its Industrial Assessments Center Implementation Grants Program to help auto suppliers kickstart manufacturing diversification and conversion projects. Specifically, this program, which was funded by President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and is covered under the President's Justice40 Initiative, provides grants of up to $300,000 to entities that have received an Industrial Assessment Center assessment to improve their facilities' energy and material efficiency, cybersecurity, or productivity, or reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe Small Business Administration will leverage its Small Business Investment Company program to catalyze millions of dollars in private capital for the EV supply chain to help small and medium-sized manufacturers grow and diversify their businesses. The Department of Energy will partner with the Small Business Administration to provide technical expertise to de-risk private investments and lower the cost of capital for small and medium-sized manufacturers.\n\nThe Small Business Administration plans to establish a new Working Capital Pilot Program under its signature 7(a) lending program to provide lines of credit to small businesses, including auto parts manufacturers and distributors, to support their domestic or export finance needs. The program will be paired with business counseling from the Small Business Administration.\n\nActions to expand workforce training and improve job quality in the EV supply chain with a focus on Auto Communities in the Midwest:\n\nLast month, President Biden announced the second round of Investing in America Workforce Hubs -- including an electric vehicle hub in Michigan, which will be led by the Department of Energy and Department of Labor in partnership with the State of Michigan. Workforce Hubs are place-based initiatives focused on partnerships for job-training to ensure all Americans can access the good jobs created by the President's Investing in America agenda. As part of the Hub, the White House and agency partners will bring together state and local partners, unions, employers, philanthropy, non-profits, community colleges, high schools, and other stakeholders to tackle discrete workforce challenges in the Michigan electric vehicle supply chain -- and to ensure that the workers, unions, and businesses that have historically powered the auto industry lead the next generation of clean vehicles.\n\nThe Department of Energy is opening applications for its new Community Workforce Readiness Accelerator for Major Projects (RAMP) Fellowship. Fellows will spend two years building and scaling projects that expand workforce development partnerships to serve local and underrepresented populations in communities that have received major clean energy and manufacturing investments, including Michigan.\n\nThe Department of Energy recently made available $24 million in grants for EV and other clean energy and advanced manufacturing workforce training at community colleges, trade schools, union training programs, and registered apprenticeships through the Industrial Assessment Centers Program, which aims to deliver on the President's Justice40 Initiative.\n\nLed by the Department of Energy, the Battery Workforce Initiative will fill a critical gap in the battery industry by developing standardized training guidelines for key battery manufacturing occupations, including operators and machine repairers, which will increase the quality of these jobs while responding to industry demand for skilled workers. The Department of Energy will pilot this workforce curriculum with union manufacturers. Under the Battery Workforce Initiative, the Department of Labor will also implement model safety and health management practices focused on battery manufacturing, as well as assess the need for an industry-wide standard.\n\nThe Department of Labor will organize EV workforce convenings in Ohio and Indiana. As part of the Building Pathways to Infrastructure Jobs Grant Program, the Department of Labor recently awarded $7 million across Indiana and Ohio to develop sector partnerships that bring together the public workforce and education system, community-based organizations, employers, and labor unions focused on the EV industry. These sector partnerships will work collaboratively to design and scale worker-centered training programs, help suppliers in auto communities analyze the impact of the EV transition on their labor force needs, and spread awareness of existing workforce development technical assistance and funding resources.\n\nNew technical assistance programs to help small and medium-sized auto parts manufacturers and their communities take advantage of growth in the EV sector and other markets:\n\nThe Department of Energy, in collaboration with industry experts, will develop a Small Supplier EV Transition Playbook to help internal combustion engine suppliers navigate the transition of their business model to EV or adjacent markets. This playbook will describe new products that ICE suppliers could produce based on existing manufacturing capabilities, outline workforce and technical changes needed to succeed in new industries, and guide suppliers through available federal resources. Applications for partnerships are open through May 23, 2024, and playbook will provide guidance to be used by the Transition Network described below.\n\nThe Federal government will launch the Auto Supplier Transition Network, which will provide research and hands on, locally based technical assistance in auto communities to help small and medium-sized auto suppliers, unions, and auto communities navigate the opportunities in the EV transition and broader clean energy manufacturing acceleration. These providers will serve as regional hubs for technical, financial, industry, and workforce resources needed to support individual suppliers. These providers will offer technical, financial, industry, and workforce resources at no or below market rate costs and include:\n\nThe Department of Energy's Industrial Assessment Centers can provide no-cost assessments to help small and medium-sized auto suppliers improve energy performance and productivity. Auto suppliers that receive an assessment can also apply for Industrial Assessments Center implementation grants of up to $300,000 to kickstart manufacturing diversification and conversion projects.\n\nManufacturing Extension Partnership Centers, public-private partnerships located in all 50 states and Puerto Rico that help small and midsized manufacturers with workforce development, market research, launching new products, and much more -- often in partnership with Industrial Assessment Centers. Manufacturing Extension Partnerships will help small and medium-sized suppliers implement recommendations from the Small Supplier EV Transition Toolkit.\n\nThe International Trade Administration local offices, which can serve as coordinators and multipliers to educate companies about these programs.\n\nSmall Business Administration district offices, which offer business development services and training to help small businesses grow.\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development State Offices, which are locally-based and can help small businesses and manufacturers in rural areas expand or improve.\n\nThese actions build on the Biden-Harris Administration's ongoing commitment to ensuring that the workers and businesses that built the auto industry remain community anchors for generations to come, including the more than 250,000 auto workers in small- and medium-sized auto parts suppliers across the country. As part of that commitment, last fall, the Department of Energy announced the availability of up to $15.5 billion in grant and loan funding to retool and convert auto factories transitioning to electric vehicles, prioritizing applications from facilities at risk of closing or recently closed, and rewards applicants that retain existing workers, have strong labor partnerships, pay high wages, and convert facilities while remaining in the same community.\n\nToday's announcement is also an important milestone in the Biden-Harris Administration's effort to help small businesses grow and thrive, including minority and veteran-owned businesses and businesses in distressed and disadvantaged communities. Traditionally underserved small businesses are growing at near-historic rates, with Black business ownership growing at the fastest pace in 30 years and Latino business ownership growing at the fastest pace in more than a decade.\n\nAs President Biden and Vice President Harris continue to invest in all of America, their agenda is lowering costs for Michigan families:\n\nSaving 2.2 million Michigan Medicare beneficiaries money on prescription drugs, insulin, and vaccines.\n\nSaving 418,000 Michiganders hundreds of dollars per year on health insurance.\n\nMichigan families will get lower utility bills thanks to $211 million in home energy rebates and new tax credits for energy-efficient appliances.\n\nPresident Biden is taking on corporate rip-offs like junk fees to lower costs for Michigan families on everything from airfares to event tickets to overdraft fees.\n\nPresident Biden would lower housing costs with a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, expanded rental assistance, and by building more than 2 million homes.\n\nPresident Biden would lower child care costs by guaranteeing child care for families making up to $200,000, with most families paying no more than $10 a day.\n\nCongressional Republicans have no plan to lower costs -- in fact, their plan would increase costs for Michiganders by:\n\nIncreasing costs for health care, prescription drugs, and insulin by siding with Big Pharma to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and Affordable Care Act and slash Medicare.\n\nCutting Social Security by $1.5 trillion and raising Medicare costs for seniors by transitioning Medicare to a system that would raise premiums.\n\nRaising taxes for middle-class families by repealing the Inflation Reduction Act and Affordable Care Act.\n\nRaising housing costs by cutting rental assistance and programs to build new homes.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Department of Energy recently made available $24 million in grants for EV and other clean energy and advanced manufacturing workforce training at community colleges, trade schools, union training programs, and registered apprenticeships through the Industrial Assessment Centers Program, which aims to deliver on the President's Justice40 Initiative. Led by the Department of Energy, the Battery Workforce Initiative will fill a critical gap in the battery industry by developing standardized training guidelines for key battery manufacturing occupations, including operators and machine repairers, which will increase the quality of these jobs while responding to industry demand for skilled workers. The Department of Energy will pilot this workforce curriculum with union manufacturers. Under the Battery Workforce Initiative, the Department of Labor will also implement model safety and health management practices focused on battery manufacturing, as well as assess the need for an industry-wide standard. The Department of Labor will organize EV workforce convenings in Ohio and Indiana. As part of the Building Pathways to Infrastructure Jobs Grant Program, the Department of Labor recently awarded $7 million across Indiana and Ohio to develop sector partnerships that bring together the public workforce and education system, community-based organizations, employers, and labor unions focused on the EV industry. These sector partnerships will work collaboratively to design and scale worker-centered training programs, help suppliers in auto communities analyze the impact of the EV transition on their labor force needs, and spread awareness of existing workforce development technical assistance and funding resources.\n\nNew technical assistance programs to help small and medium-sized auto parts manufacturers and their communities take advantage of growth in the EV sector and other markets:\n\nThe Department of Energy, in collaboration with industry experts, will develop a Small Supplier EV Transition Playbook to help internal combustion engine suppliers navigate the transition of their business model to EV or adjacent markets. This playbook will describe new products that ICE suppliers could produce based on existing manufacturing capabilities, outline workforce and technical changes needed to succeed in new industries, and guide suppliers through available federal resources. Applications for partnerships are open through May 23, 2024, and playbook will provide guidance to be used by the Transition Network described below. The Federal government will launch the Auto Supplier Transition Network, which will provide research and hands on, locally based technical assistance in auto communities to help small and medium-sized auto suppliers, unions, and auto communities navigate the opportunities in the EV transition and broader clean energy manufacturing acceleration. These providers will serve as regional hubs for technical, financial, industry, and workforce resources needed to support individual suppliers. These providers will offer technical, financial, industry, and workforce resources at no or below market rate costs and include: The Department of Energy's Industrial Assessment Centers can provide no-cost assessments to help small and medium-sized auto suppliers improve energy performance and productivity. Auto suppliers that receive an assessment can also apply for Industrial Assessments Center implementation grants of up to $300,000 to kickstart manufacturing diversification and conversion projects. Manufacturing Extension Partnership Centers, public-private partnerships located in all 50 states and Puerto Rico that help small and midsized manufacturers with workforce development, market research, launching new products, and much more-often in partnership with Industrial Assessment Centers. Manufacturing Extension Partnerships will help small and medium-sized suppliers implement recommendations from the Small Supplier EV Transition Toolkit. The International Trade Administration local offices, which can serve as coordinators and multipliers to educate companies about these programs. Small Business Administration district offices, which offer business development services and training to help small businesses grow. U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development State Offices, which are locally-based and can help small businesses and manufacturers in rural areas expand or improve.\n\nThese actions build on the Biden-Harris Administration's ongoing commitment to ensuring that the workers and businesses that built the auto industry remain community anchors for generations to come, including the more than 250,000 auto workers in small- and medium-sized auto parts suppliers across the country. As part of that commitment, last fall, the Department of Energy announced the availability of up to $15.5 billion in grant and loan funding to retool and convert auto factories transitioning to electric vehicles, prioritizing applications from facilities at risk of closing or recently closed, and rewards applicants that retain existing workers, have strong labor partnerships, pay high wages, and convert facilities while remaining in the same community.\n\nToday's announcement is also an important milestone in the Biden-Harris Administration's effort to help small businesses grow and thrive, including minority and veteran-owned businesses and businesses in distressed and disadvantaged communities. Traditionally underserved small businesses are growing at near-historic rates, with Black business ownership growing at the fastest pace in 30 years and Latino business ownership growing at the fastest pace in more than a decade.\n\nAs President Biden and Vice President Harris continue to invest in all of America, their agenda is lowering costs for Michigan families:\n\nSaving 2.2 million Michigan Medicare beneficiaries money on prescription drugs, insulin, and vaccines.Saving 418,000 Michiganders hundreds of dollars per year on health insurance.Michigan families will get lower utility bills thanks to $211 million in home energy rebates and new tax credits for energy-efficient appliances.President Biden is taking on corporate rip-offs like junk fees to lower costs for Michigan families on everything from airfares to event tickets to overdraft fees.President Biden would lower housing costs with a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, expanded rental assistance, and by building more than 2 million homes.President Biden would lower child care costs by guaranteeing child care for families making up to $200,000, with most families paying no more than $10 a day.\n\nCongressional Republicans have no plan to lower costs-in fact, their plan would increase costs for Michiganders by:\n\nIncreasing costs for health care, prescription drugs, and insulin by siding with Big Pharma to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and Affordable Care Act and slash Medicare.Cutting Social Security by $1.5 trillion and raising Medicare costs for seniors by transitioning Medicare to a system that would raise premiums.Raising taxes for middle-class families by repealing the Inflation Reduction Act and Affordable Care Act.Raising housing costs by cutting rental assistance and programs to build new homes. /Public Release.

The White House stated that this funding will be used to assist auto workers, as well as small and medium-sized auto parts manufacturers, in \"expanding or retooling manufacturing facilities.\"\n\nAccording to the Office of the VP, historic contracts secured by the United Auto Workers with Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, known as the Big 3 Detroit automakers, along with victories at Volkswagen in Tennessee, ensure that future jobs in the auto industry will provide \"comparable wages, retirement security, and respect at work,\" Reuters reported.\n\nThe $100 million funding will be divided into two parts. The Department of Energy will set aside $50 million of its Automotive Conversion Grants Program, and the other $50 million will come from the DOE's Industrial Assessments Center Implementation Grants Program.\n\nOne of the main goals of the funding is to establish partnerships with states to assist suppliers in transitioning their businesses from manufacturing parts for internal combustion engines to manufacturing parts for EVs.\n\nAnother objective is to help auto suppliers \"kickstart manufacturing diversification and conversion projects.\" The program was funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of Pres. Joe Biden and is also covered by the President's Justice40 Initiative, providing entities that received an Industrial Assessment Center with grants of up to $300,000. The grant aims to help them improve material efficiency, energy efficiency, productivity, cybersecurity, and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe initiative to support autoworkers and small to medium-sized auto industries is still part of the Investing in America agenda, the program of Pres. Biden and VP Harris aimed at building the economy from the middle-out to the bottom-up, providing significant funding to various sectors to reach every corner of the U.S. Accordingly, since the program began, companies have announced investments of more than $170 billion in EVs and battery supply chain manufacturing. The U.S. auto industry has also added more than 250,000 jobs after losing approximately 90,000 jobs in the previous administration.\n\nAccording to the White House's press release, these actions are based on the ongoing commitment to ensure that the businesses and workers that built the American auto industry will remain as anchors of the community for generations to come. This will include more than 250,000 auto workers in small and medium-sized auto suppliers across the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ann_resuma@ibtimes.com", "name": "Ann Resuma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stellantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Investment_and_Jobs_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_efficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Material efficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Related Services", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4519861/us-vice-president-kamala-harris-said-donald-trump-would-gut-abortion-rights-nationwide.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542399", "eventUri": "eng-9542399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The Biden administration, knowing that, has made several similar announcements aimed at Michigan recently and is deploying top surrogates alongside Harris for the announcement.\n\nOf the new funds, the Energy Department's Automotive Conversion Grant program will receive $50 million to help small and medium-size suppliers convert from manufacturing parts for internal combustion engine vehicles to manufacturing parts for the EV supply chain.\n\nThe program, according to the White House, aims to \"keep good, good-paying and union jobs in the same communities as automakers and auto suppliers transition to electric vehicle manufacturing here in America.\"\n\nThe Energy Department's Industrial Assessments Center Implementation Grants Program will get the other $50 million to help auto suppliers \"improve their facilities' energy and material efficiency, cybersecurity, or productivity, or reduce the greenhouse gas emissions,\" the White House said.\n\nThe programs are funded by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, respectively.\n\nHarris is also expected to announce new efforts from the Small Business Administration to facilitate private investments into the EV supply chain and expand the lines of credit available to small businesses through the SBA.\n\n\"These actions build on the Biden-Harris Administration's ongoing commitment to ensuring that the workers and businesses that built the auto industry remain community anchors for generations to come,\" the White House said.\n\nThe vice president will be joined by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Department of Energy Secretary and former Gov. Jennifer Granholm, Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su and Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Steven Horsford, D-Nev.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar of Detroit and Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II will attend as well.\n\nThe Biden administration, and the president's campaign staff, have made several trips to Michigan in recent months.\n\nThe president visited Metro Detroit in February and Saginaw in March. He will return this month to be the keynote speaker for the NAACP Detroit Branch's 69th annual Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner on May 19.\n\nThe Energy Department, meanwhile, unveiled a training program for battery plant jobs when Granholm came to Michigan in March.\n\nLast month, though there was no Michigan visit, the Biden administration announced a new workforce hub meant to train or retrain workers in the state for EV-centric jobs through apprenticeships, high school programs and community colleges.\n\nMore: Electric vehicle 'workforce hub' coming to Michigan, White House says\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has repeatedly slammed Biden's policies promoting electric vehicles. During a campaign rally in Freeland last week, he said they would bring \"an economic bloodbath.\"\n\nHe pointed out the high price tag for most EVs and their inferior range compared to gas-powered cars.\n\n\"If I want to drive from Michigan, let's say to Mar-a-Lago.

Additionally, the Small Business Administration said it will create a pilot program to provide lines of credit and business counseling to small businesses including suppliers and parts distributors.\n\nIn Detroit, Harris plans to also highlight other White House initiatives aimed at boosting the EV supply chain, including $24 million the DOE recently made available for advanced manufacturing workforce training, and the creation of the Battery Workforce Initiative designed to develop training guidelines for skilled trades workers in EV battery manufacturing.", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_irwin@autonews.com", "name": "John Irwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Granholm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Granholm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small Business Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/1024x512/public/5969d0cb-22ed-4738-8a52-0b1105e06486.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542399", "eventUri": "eng-9542399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

These conversations helped inform the announcements made today, which include the establishment of programming and grants to upgrade small and medium-sized facilities in Michigan to support EV and battery supply chain manufacturing throughout the industry transition.\n\n\"The Department of Energy (DOE) will design the $50 million grant program to support the needs of Michigan automotive suppliers. According to the Center for Automotive Research, Michigan is home to over 1,000 independent automotive suppliers, and 140 of these suppliers and over 45,000 of their workers may need to retool their facilities and convert from making ICE vehicles or components to EVs or components,\" said Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II in a statement. \"The new initiative will help develop a domestic, diversified EV supply chain, retain high-quality, good-paying jobs, and support the Administration's goal of having 50% of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. DOE issued a Request for Information last month seeking input on the proposed fund.\" Applications are not yet open for this fund.\n\nIn addition to this, the Department of Energy is setting aside up to $50 million of its Industrial Assessments Center Implementation Grants Program to help auto suppliers kickstart manufacturing diversification and conversion projects. Specifically, this program, which was funded by U.S. President Joe Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and is covered under his Justice40 Initiative, provides grants of up to $300,000 to entities that have received an Industrial Assessment Center assessment to improve their facilities' energy and material efficiency, cybersecurity, or productivity, or reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. Learn more and apply by July 1.\n\nThis rollout follows President Biden's announcement of the Michigan EV Workforce Hub earlier this month. Workforce Hubs are place-based initiatives focused on partnerships for job training to ensure all Americans can access good jobs. Federal agencies will also work together to create a technical assistance network for the auto supply chain and collaborate on a resource guide for auto manufacturers looking to transition into production for the EV supply chain.\n\nThrough its convening and advocacy efforts, MICHauto will continue to work with policymakers to strengthen the automotive industry, protecting and growing jobs and investment here in Michigan in this dynamic time of change and transition.\n\nMICHauto is monitoring this topic and continue to update this post as new information is available.", "source":

Michigan's 15 electoral votes could prove pivotal in the close race expected between Biden and Trump.\n\nThe two candidates know how crucial the state is. The Detroit Free Press noted that Trump has made three visits to the state in the last 2\u00bd months while Biden visited UAW workers in February in Warren, Michigan, Saginaw in March, and is expected to speak at the Detroit NAACP's dinner on May 19.\n\nOn Monday, the White House announced that the Department of Energy will set aside $50 million of its Automotive Conversion Grants Program \"to help small- and medium-sized suppliers convert from manufacturing internal combustion engine parts to manufacturing parts for the EV supply chain.\"\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Energy \"is setting aside up to $50 million of its Industrial Assessments Center Implementation Grants Program to help auto suppliers kickstart manufacturing diversification and conversion projects.\"\n\nThere's more: \"The Small Business Administration will leverage its Small Business Investment Company program to catalyze millions of dollars in private capital for the EV supply chain to help small and medium-sized manufacturers grow and diversify their businesses. ... The Small Business Administration plans to establish a new Working Capital Pilot Program under its signature 7(a) lending program to provide lines of credit to small businesses, including auto parts manufacturers and distributors, to support their domestic or export finance needs.\"\n\nBiden's policy vis-\u00e0-vis Israel and Hamas has been heavily influenced by his apparent desire to cater to the desires of the Muslim community in Michigan. On October 30, roughly three weeks after the October 7 massacre in which the terrorist group Hamas murdered more than 1200 Israelis, Muslim leaders wrote a letter to Biden and the \"Democratic Party leadership\" titled \"2023 Ceasefire Ultimatum,\" in which they vowed to withhold Muslim voter support for \"any candidate who did not advocate for a ceasefire.\"\n\nWithin days, the Biden administration reportedly warned Israel that support for its war effort would erode.\n\n\"Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken - who departed Thursday for Israel with a message on protecting civilian lives - have all explicitly pressed the case in recent private conversations with the Israelis, telling them that eroding support will have dire strategic consequences for Israel Defense Forces operations against Hamas,\" CNN reported in early November.\n\nOn March 25, the Biden administration refused to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate Gaza ceasefire, with no conditions for the release of hostages held by Hamas. \"On April 4, in a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden reportedly harangued

The announcement comes as the Biden administration aims to establish America as a global leader in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing and help U.S. manufacturers meet the Biden administration's goal of having 50% of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030.\n\nAnd yet the U.S. auto industry continues to grapple with a ticking time bomb in the form of cheap Chinese-made EVs, the first of which is set to enter the U.S. market this summer.\n\nAs Harris announced, the Department of Energy (DOE) will provide $100 million to support auto manufacturers as they convert from internal combustion engine parts and kickstart production in the EV supply chain, and the Small Business Administration has created a new lending program geared to these manufacturers. These funding opportunities follow the Inflation Reduction Act's $55.1 billion investment in U.S. battery manufacturing and $16.1 billion for EV factories, an effort that has paid off so far.\n\nSince President Biden took office, private companies have announced more than $170 billion in investment in EV and battery manufacturing, according to the White House, and the auto industry has gained more than 90,000 jobs.\n\nBut, as Bloomberg puts it, \"the biggest transformation of the auto industry in a century is underway.\" The problem is that China has long had a head start in an economy divorced from true market forces, making millions more EVs than Chinese consumers demand.\n\nSince 2001, Beijing has set its sights on dominating the global electric vehicle market, identifying the technology as a top priority in its tenth Five-Year Plan that year. The Chinese government has kept its automakers and manufacturers throughout the EV supply chain, which is inextricably enmeshed with the state's Uyghur forced labor program, awash with government funding. Pitting Made in America EVs against Chinese-made rivals will never be a fair game.\n\nThe Biden administration's most recent funding announcement plays a role in ensuring that the U.S. auto industry transitions to an EV future without compromising community-supporting factory jobs, but it's past time for the United States to get serious about protecting our burgeoning EV industry. America must pair industrial investment in U.S. EVs with strong, proactive trade policy. That means imposing exclusionary tariffs on all Chinese auto imports, even to the point of a ban.\n\nHere are Alliance for American Manufacturing President Scott Paul's thoughts as shared in a recent NPR story:", "source": {"uri": "americanmanufacturing.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alliance for American Manufacturing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation Reduction Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small Business Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forced labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_for_American_Manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alliance for American Manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uyghurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Wholesale_Trade/General_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Business/Wholesale Trade/General Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.americanmanufacturing.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1066926898-2048x1365.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542399", "eventUri": "eng-9542399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

These conversations helped inform the announcements made today, which include the establishment of programming and grants to upgrade small and medium-sized facilities in Michigan to support EV and battery supply chain manufacturing throughout the industry transition.\n\n\"The Department of Energy (DOE) will design the $50 million grant program to support the needs of Michigan automotive suppliers. According to the Center for Automotive Research, Michigan is home to over 1,000 independent automotive suppliers, and 140 of these suppliers and over 45,000 of their workers may need to retool their facilities and convert from making ICE vehicles or components to EVs or components,\" said Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II in a statement. \"The new initiative will help develop a domestic, diversified EV supply chain, retain high-quality, good-paying jobs, and support the Administration's goal of having 50% of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. DOE issued a Request for Information last month seeking input on the proposed fund.\" Applications are not yet open for this fund.\n\nIn addition to this, the Department of Energy is setting aside up to $50 million of its Industrial Assessments Center Implementation Grants Program to help auto suppliers kickstart manufacturing diversification and conversion projects. Specifically, this program, which was funded by U.S. President Joe Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and is covered under his Justice40 Initiative, provides grants of up to $300,000 to entities that have received an Industrial Assessment Center assessment to improve their facilities' energy and material efficiency, cybersecurity, or productivity, or reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. Learn more and apply by July 1.\n\nThis rollout follows President Biden's announcement of the Michigan EV Workforce Hub earlier this month. Workforce Hubs are place-based initiatives focused on partnerships for job training to ensure all Americans can access good jobs. Federal agencies will also work together to create a technical assistance network for the auto supply chain and collaborate on a resource guide for auto manufacturers looking to transition into production for the EV supply chain.\n\nThrough its convening and advocacy efforts, MICHauto will continue to work with policymakers to strengthen the automotive industry, protecting and growing jobs and investment here in Michigan in this dynamic time of change and transition.\n\nMICHauto is monitoring this topic and continue to update this post as new information is available.", "source":

There is no more time to waste talking about old offers with new wrapping. Enough is enough.\n\n\"Industrial action will start in two weeks unless ministers and local authorities urgently identify the money needed to make a fair and acceptable offer.\n\n\"These strikes will be disruptive to all the Scots who rely on our members' work, but would not be necessary if councils had shown a greater urgency and sense of realism.\"\n\nUnison Scotland local government leader David O'Connor said while the talks had been \"positive\" they had taken place \"too late to prevent strike notices being served\".\n\nCollette Hunter, Unison Scotland's local government chairwoman, said: \"Strikes are always the last resort. But local government staff have seen the value of their wages reduced by a quarter over the past 14 years.\n\n\"They're simply asking for a pay deal that recognises the essential services they deliver and starts to address years of below-inflation pay settlements.\n\n\"Cosla and the Scottish Government must understand the anger among council staff. They are resolute and strikes will go ahead unless a solution can be found.\"\n\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"Thousands of Unite members will take strike action next month unless there is a new credible pay offer put on the table.\"\n\nGraham McNab, industrial officer with the union, said: \"Unite stands ready to enter into meaningful negotiations at any time but our members need to see a significant shift in the coming days to avert strike action.\n\n\"Strike action is not yet inevitable but action from the politicians must be imminent.\n\n\"There is a window of opportunity to resolve this dispute but the politicians should be under no illusions that our members will take strike action if necessary to secure the pay offer which they deserve.\"\n\nMs Hagmann meanwhile said the talks on Tuesday had given Cosla the chance to \"articulate the financial challenges facing local government in relation to meeting pay claims\".\n\nShe added: \"It was an open and honest dialogue about how challenging the situation is in relation to council finances.\n\n\"Whilst no immediate solution was identified, officers will now undertake further work at pace in the coming days to explore all options to avoid industrial action.\"\n\nShe stressed to the Finance Secretary \"the very limited options available to local government, and that any solution needs to be both affordable and sustainable\".\n\nMs Hagmann continued: \"Cosla remains committed to continuing our negotiations towards finding a solution as quickly as possible, seeking to do all we can to avoid industrial action and its damaging impact on our communities.\n\n\"Council leaders value the local government workforce and their essential work across our communities, they recognise the workforce pressures and the need to reward equitably.\"\n\nSpeaking after the talks on Tuesday evening, Ms Robison said her officials will now \"work at pace with local government officers to understand what an improved negotiating envelope may look like\".\n\nWhile the Scottish Conservatives are demanding that First Minister John Swinney intervenes in a bid to resolve the dispute, Ms Robison stressed the government has \"no formal role in local pay negotiations\".", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katrine_bussey@aol.co.uk", "name":

This week's statement from the Chancellor revealed the extent of the challenges facing the public sector across the UK.\n\n\"What is particularly worrying is that in her statement the Chancellor announced she is not fully funding the public sector pay deals she has accepted.\n\n\"Instead, cuts are being demanded across most of Whitehall. That means that we will not receive full Barnett consequentials from these pay deals.\n\n\"It is amid this extremely challenging landscape then, that I have asked my officials to work at pace with local government officers to understand what an improved negotiating envelope may look like. I welcomed the willingness of COSLA and trade union leaders to engage constructively with that process.\"\n\nHer Conservative shadow Liz Smith said the SNP had only itself to blame as it had imposed deep cuts on local government.\n\n\"This is concerning and disappointing news, which raises the spectre of rubbish piling up on streets across Scotland.\n\n\"The buck stops firmly with the SNP Government for this dispute. Their systematic underfunding of local government, year after year, has left our councils so hamstrung that they have been unable to reach a pay agreement with the unions.\n\n\"It's taken too long for the SNP to get involved - and still they have failed to resolve it. [First Minister] John Swinney must now urgently intervene to prevent these strikes going ahead - or there will be a public health risk as well as our streets looking like a tip during the Edinburgh Festival.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailybusinessgroup.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "terry_murden@dailybusinessgroup.co.uk", "name": "Terry Murden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shona_Robison", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shona Robison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of the Exchequer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_Scottish_Local_Authorities", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convention of Scottish Local Authorities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Smith_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liz Smith (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Swinney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Swinney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish National Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Public_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Public Administration", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://dailybusinessgroup.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Woman-puts-litter-in-overflowing-bin-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776768", "eventUri": "eng-9776768", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

This week's statement from the Chancellor revealed the extent of the challenges facing the public sector across the UK.\n\n\"What is particularly worrying is that in her statement the Chancellor announced she is not fully funding the public sector pay deals she has accepted.\n\n\"Instead, cuts are being demanded across most of Whitehall. That means that we will not receive full Barnett consequentials from these pay deals.\n\n\"It is amid this extremely challenging landscape then, that I have asked my officials to work at pace with local government officers to understand what an improved negotiating envelope may look like.\n\n\"I welcomed the willingness of COSLA and trade union leaders to engage constructively with that process.\"\n\nAs it stands, workers from three unions - Unite, GMB, and Unison - are set to take part in industrial action after being balloted.\n\nAll three unions rejected the latest offer of a 3.2 per cent wage increase for a one year period between 1 April and 31 March 2025.\n\nThe offer has been described as 'grossly undervaluing' Scottish council workers in contrast with the offer made to UK counterparts, where a 5.2 per cent increase was tabled.\n\nIndustrial action could come within days, as GMB already having the backing of workers in nearly half of the 32 local authorities across

This week's statement from the Chancellor revealed the extent of the challenges facing the public sector across the UK.\n\n\"What is particularly worrying is that in her statement the Chancellor announced she is not fully funding the public sector pay deals she has accepted. Instead, cuts are being demanded across most of Whitehall. That means that we will not receive full Barnett consequentials from these pay deals.\n\n\"It is amid this extremely challenging landscape then, that I have asked my officials to work at pace with local government officers to understand what an improved negotiating envelope may look like. I welcomed the willingness of COSLA and trade union leaders to engage constructively with that process.\"\n\nAs it stands, workers from three unions - Unite, GMB, and Unison - are set to take part in industrial action after being balloted.\n\nAll three unions rejected the latest offer of a 3.2 per cent wage increase for a on year period between 1 April and 31 March 2025.\n\nThe offer has been

There is no more time to waste talking about old offers with new wrapping. Enough is enough.\n\n\"Industrial action will start in two weeks unless ministers and local authorities urgently identify the money needed to make a fair and acceptable offer.\n\n\"These strikes will be disruptive to all the Scots who rely on our members' work, but would not be necessary if councils had shown a greater urgency and sense of realism.\"\n\nMs Hagmann said the talks on Tuesday had given Cosla the chance to \"articulate the financial challenges facing local government in relation to meeting pay claims\".\n\nShe added: \"It was an open and honest dialogue about how challenging the situation is in relation to council finances.\n\n\"Whilst no immediate solution was identified, officers will now undertake further work at pace in the coming days to explore all options to avoid industrial action.\"\n\nShe stressed to the Finance Secretary \"the very limited options available to local government, and that any solution needs to be both affordable and sustainable\".\n\nMs Hagmann continued: \"Cosla remains committed to continuing our negotiations towards finding a solution as quickly as possible, seeking to do all we can to avoid industrial action and its damaging impact on our communities.\n\n\"Council leaders value the local government workforce and their essential work across our communities, they recognise the workforce pressures and the need to reward equitably.\"\n\nSpeaking after the talks on Tuesday evening, Ms Robison said her officials will now \"work at pace with local government officers to understand what an improved negotiating envelope may look like\".\n\nWhile the Scottish Conservatives are demanding that First Minister John Swinney intervenes in a bid to resolve the dispute, Ms Robison stressed the Government has \"no formal role in local pay negotiations\".", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's easy and will only take a moment.\n\nAn eight-day bin strike could hit bin collections in the Highlands next month after pay talks stalled.\n\nThe unions GMB Scotland, Unite, and Unison have all served formal notice of their intent for a walkout from 5am on Wednesday, August 14 until 4.59am on Thursday, August 22,\n\nThe industrial action dates come after pay talks between the unions and Cosla, which represents Scotland's councils, stalled. The Scottish Government joined negotiations yesterday (Tuesday).\n\nIf the strike goes ahead, Highland Council will be among the local authorities affected.\n\nKeir Greenaway, GMB Scotland senior organiser in public services, said a rejected pay offer of 3.2 per cent had failed to match the escalating cost of living or the rise offered to council workers in England and Wales.\n\nHe said: \"We had constructive talks with the Scottish Government and Cosla yesterday but our members are less interested in constructive talks than fair pay.\n\n\"The process has gone on too long with too little progress.\n\n\"We are more than halfway through the year and there is no more time to waste discussing old offers with new wrapping. Enough is enough.\n\n\"Industrial action will start in two weeks unless ministers and local authorities identify the money needed to make an acceptable offer.\n\n\"These strikes will be disruptive to all the Scots who rely on our members' work but would not be necessary if councils had shown a greater urgency and sense of realism.\"\n\nIf the strike goes ahead it could cause significant disruption for residents in some Highland communities, where the ongoing roll-out of changes to collections to increase the number of domestic bins means that certain recycling bins are now only emptied once a month. It is not known what will happen if one of those monthly collections is missed due to the strikes.\n\nHowever, union reps have spoken of \"positive\" recent discussions, raising the hope that a pay deal may yet be reached - but they also stressed that the industrial action will go ahead \"unless a solution can be found\".\n\nUnison Scotland local government lead David O'Connor said: \"Talks this week with the Scottish government were positive. The cabinet secretary says he understands that additional funding from government is necessary and has committed to work towards that.\n\n\"Unison has been trying to get pay resolved since the beginning of the year and these government talks come too late to prevent strike notices being served. But at least we're forcing employers and government to focus on trying to find a settlement.\"\n\nUnison Scotland local government chair Colette Hunter added: \"Strikes are always the last resort. But local government staff have seen the value of their wages reduced by a quarter over the past 14 years.\n\n\"They're simply asking for a pay deal that recognises the essential services they deliver and starts to address years of below-inflation pay settlements.\n\n\"Cosla and the Scottish Government must understand the anger among council staff. They are resolute and strikes will go ahead unless a solution can be found.\"\n\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham added: \"Thousands of Unite members will take strike action next month unless there is a new credible pay offer put on the table.\n\n\"Our membership has waited months for an offer which reflects their professionalism and the dedication which they put into delivering vital local services.\"\n\nGraham McNab, Unite industrial officer, added: \"Unite stands ready to enter into meaningful negotiations at any time but our members need to see a significant shift in the coming days to avert strike action. Strike action is not yet inevitable but action from the politicians must be imminent.\n\n\"There is a window of opportunity to resolve this dispute but the politicians should be under no illusions that our members will take strike action if necessary to secure the pay offer which they deserve.\"", "source": {"uri": "northern-times.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northern Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Highlands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Industrial action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMB_(trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "GMB (trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unison_(trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unison (trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unite the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Graham", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sharon Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.northern-times.co.uk/_media/img/ILIC53ZJOCL34N7RJRFJ.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776768", "eventUri": "eng-9776768", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-14", "dateEnd": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 327, "textEnd": 344}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 363, "textEnd": 372}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

It was an open and honest dialogue about how challenging the situation is in relation to council finances. It remains understood by all parties that pay negotiations remain between COSLA (as the Employer) and the Trade Unions.\n\n\"Whilst no immediate solution was identified, officers will now undertake further work at pace in the coming days to explore all options to avoid industrial action. However, I reiterated to the Cabinet Secretary the very limited options available to Local Government, and that any solution needs to be both affordable and sustainable.\n\n\"COSLA remains committed to continuing our negotiations towards finding a solution as quickly as possible, seeking to do all we can to avoid industrial action and its damaging impact on our communities. Council Leaders value the local government workforce and their essential work across our communities, they recognise the workforce pressures and the need to reward equitably.\"\n\nShona Robison, the SNP Finance Secretary, said: \"We are navigating turbulent financial waters. This week's statement from the Chancellor revealed the extent of the challenges facing the public sector across the UK.\n\n\"What is particularly worrying is that in her statement the Chancellor announced she is not fully funding the public sector pay deals she has accepted. Instead, cuts are being demanded across most of Whitehall. That means that we will not receive full Barnett consequentials from these pay deals.\n\n\"It is amid this extremely challenging landscape then, that I have asked my officials to work at pace with local government officers to understand what an improved negotiating envelope may look like.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from the West Lothian Courier.

Enough is enough.\n\n\"Industrial action will start in two weeks unless ministers and local authorities identify the money needed to make an acceptable offer,\" said O'Connor.\n\nAccording to Robison, Holyrood officials will \"work at pace with local government officers to understand what an improved negotiating envelope may look like.\"\n\n\"I welcomed the willingness of Cosla and trade union leaders to engage constructively with that process,\" Robison added.\n\nThe Scottish Conservative finance and local government spokesperson, Liz Smith has warned of a \"public health risk as well as our streets looking like a tip during the Edinburgh Festival.\"\n\nHowever, according to Robison, the \"Scottish Government has no formal role in local pay negotiations.\"\n\nShe added that the UK's public sector is facing a challenging period, with cuts being demanded across most of Whitehall.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government in Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unison_(trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unison (trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMB_(trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GMB (trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clackmannanshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clackmannanshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clackmannanshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subdivisions of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fife"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fife"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Edinburgh_festivals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of Edinburgh festivals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Conservatives", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Conservatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/08/1.download-289-700x420.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776768", "eventUri": "eng-9776768", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The Scottish Government joined negotiations yesterday (Tuesday).\n\nIf the strike goes ahead, Highland Council will be among the local authorities affected.\n\nKeir Greenaway, GMB Scotland senior organiser in public services, said a rejected pay offer of 3.2 per cent had failed to match the escalating cost of living or the rise offered to council workers in England and Wales.\n\nHe said: \"We had constructive talks with the Scottish Government and Cosla yesterday but our members are less interested in constructive talks than fair pay.\n\n\"The process has gone on too long with too little progress.\n\n\"We are more than halfway through the year and there is no more time to waste discussing old offers with new wrapping. Enough is enough.\n\n\"Industrial action will start in two weeks unless ministers and local authorities identify the money needed to make an acceptable offer.\n\n\"These strikes will be disruptive to all the Scots who rely on our members' work but would not be necessary if councils had shown a greater urgency and sense of realism.\"\n\nIf the strike goes ahead it could cause significant disruption for residents in some Highland communities, where the ongoing roll-out of changes to collections to increase the number of domestic bins means that certain recycling bins are now only emptied once a month. It is not known what will happen if one of those monthly collections is missed due to the strikes.\n\nHowever, union reps have spoken of \"positive\" recent discussions, raising the hope that a pay deal may yet be reached - but they also stressed that the industrial action will go ahead \"unless a solution can be found\".\n\nUnison Scotland local government lead David O'Connor said: \"Talks this week with the Scottish government were positive. The cabinet secretary says he understands that additional funding from government is necessary and has committed to work towards that.\n\n\"Unison has been trying to get pay resolved since the beginning of the year and these government talks come too late to prevent strike notices being served. But at least we're forcing employers and government to focus on trying to find a settlement.\"\n\nUnison Scotland local government chair Colette Hunter added: \"Strikes are always the last resort. But local government staff have seen the value of their wages reduced by a quarter over the past 14 years.\n\n\"They're simply asking for a pay deal that recognises the essential services they deliver and starts to address years of below-inflation pay settlements.\n\n\"Cosla and the Scottish Government must understand the anger among council staff. They are resolute and strikes will go ahead unless a solution can be found.\"", "source": {"uri": "ross-shirejournal.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "RossShire Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unison_(trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unison (trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Industrial action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMB_(trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "GMB (trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Government", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Highland_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Highland Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Highlands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_(council_area)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Highland (council area)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Highland (council area)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.ross-shirejournal.co.uk/_media/img/OPZ2VUU2PU6ID3FW0OV8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776768", "eventUri": "eng-9776768", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-14", "dateEnd": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 309, "textEnd": 326}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 345, "textEnd": 354}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

There is no more time to waste talking about old offers with new wrapping. Enough is enough.\n\n\"Industrial action will start in two weeks unless ministers and local authorities urgently identify the money needed to make a fair and acceptable offer.\n\n\"These strikes will be disruptive to all the Scots who rely on our members' work, but would not be necessary if councils had shown a greater urgency and sense of realism.\"\n\nMs Hagmann said the talks on Tuesday had given Cosla the chance to \"articulate the financial challenges facing local government in relation to meeting pay claims\".\n\nShe added: \"It was an open and honest dialogue about how challenging the situation is in relation to council finances.\n\n\"Whilst no immediate solution was identified, officers will now undertake further work at pace in the coming days to explore all options to avoid industrial action.\"\n\nShe stressed to the Finance Secretary \"the very limited options available to local government, and that any solution needs to be both affordable and sustainable\".\n\nMs Hagmann continued: \"Cosla remains committed to continuing our negotiations towards finding a solution as quickly as possible, seeking to do all we can to avoid industrial action and its damaging impact on our communities.\n\n\"Council leaders value the local government workforce and their essential work across our communities, they recognise the workforce pressures and the need to reward equitably.\"\n\nSpeaking after the talks on Tuesday evening, Ms Robison said her officials will now \"work at pace with local government officers to understand what an improved negotiating envelope may look like\".\n\nWhile the Scottish Conservatives are demanding that First Minister John Swinney intervenes in a bid to resolve the dispute, Ms Robison stressed the Government has \"no formal role in local pay negotiations\".\n\nGMB Scotland members in waste will begin an eight-day strike at 5am on Wednesday, August 14, ending at 4.59am on Thursday, August 22.\n\nIt will involve the following councils: Aberdeenshire; Aberdeen City; East Ayrshire; City of Edinburgh; East Dunbartonshire; Falkirk; Fife; Glasgow; Highland; Inverclyde; Midlothian; North Lanarkshire; Orkney Islands; Perth & Kinross; Renfrewshire; South Lanarkshire; Stirling; and West Lothian.\n\nGlasgow City Council has been contacted for comment.", "source": {"uri": "glasgowtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Enough is enough.\n\n\"Industrial action will start in two weeks unless ministers and local authorities identify the money needed to make an acceptable offer.\n\n\"These strikes will be disruptive to all the Scots who rely on our members' work but would not be necessary if councils had shown a greater urgency and sense of realism.\"\n\nUNISON Scotland local government lead David O'Connor added: \"Talks this week with the Scottish Government were positive.\n\n\"The cabinet secretary says he understands that additional funding from government is necessary and has committed to work towards that.\n\n\"UNISON has been trying to get pay resolved since the beginning of the year and these government talks come too late to prevent strike notices being served.\n\n\"But at least we're forcing employers and government to focus on trying to find a settlement.\"\n\nUNISON Scotland local government chair Colette Hunter said: \"Strikes are always the last resort. But local government staff have seen the value of their wages reduced by a quarter over the past 14 years.\n\n\"They're simply asking for a pay deal that recognises the essential services they deliver and starts to address years of below-inflation pay settlements.\n\n\"Cosla and the Scottish Government must understand the anger among council staff. They are resolute and strikes will go ahead unless a solution can be found.\"\n\n*Don't miss the latest headlines from around Lanarkshire.

and refuse workers are set to take part in co-ordinated walkouts in Inverclyde and at local authorities across Scotland.\n\nUnite, Unison and the GMB announced on Wednesday that some of their members would be taking part in co-ordinated walkouts between August 14 and 22.\n\nWaste workers, street cleaners, and recycling centre operators will be among those taking part in the strikes, which the council says are set to cause a 'significant' disruption to local services.\n\nREAD MORE: Inverclyde Council launches new CCTV system costing \u00a375,000\n\nA statement issued yesterday by Unite, which counts most of the local refuse workforce among its members, said the action would go ahead across 18 councils unless a \"credible\" pay offer is tabled beforehand.\n\nThe news came after the union held \"positive talks\" with Scotland's cabinet secretary for finance and local government Shona Robison on Tuesday, as well as with COSLA, which represents the country's local authorities.\n\nInverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe told the Telegraph today that Ms Robison, who is also Deputy First Minister, would have to take swift action if walkouts were to be averted.\n\nHe said: \"All three unions have now advised us that they will be taking coordinated action over those eight days, which will result in a significant interruption of services, impacting on the community.\n\n\"Management will be looking at what contingency arrangements can be put in place but with 96 employees due to go on strike if any services are able to continue, they will be very limited.\n\n\"COSLA met with the Deputy First Minister on Tuesday along with the trade unions to seek extra funding to allow an improved offer to be made that might settle the dispute.\n\n\"No commitment was given by Ms Robison.\n\n\"If the strike due to commence on August 14 is to be avoided, Ms Robison needs to act quickly.\"\n\nThe current COSLA pay offer amounts to a 3.2 per cent increase for a one-year period between April 1, 2024 and March 31, 2025.\n\nThe pay dispute affects all council staff.\n\nUnite has said the pay offer \"grossly undervalues\" Scottish council workers, while a senior GMB organiser claimed it had failed to match the escalating cost of living or the rise offered to council workers in England and Wales.\n\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"Thousands of Unite members will take strike action next month unless there is a new credible pay offer put on the table.\n\n\"Our membership has waited months for an offer which reflects their professionalism and the dedication which they put into delivering vital local services.\"\n\nIf the action goes ahead, Inverclyde is set to see a repeat of the scenes of August 2022, when picket lines were formed outside Greenock's Pottery Street recycling centre by Unite members.\n\nWhen contacted by the Telegraph for comment on the upcoming disruption, an Inverclyde Council spokesperson said: \"We have been informed by the trade unions of members' intention to take industrial action as part of a national pay dispute and we await further information on what that will mean for Inverclyde.\n\n\"In the meantime, we are continuing to liaise with our partners at COSLA who are leading the negotiations on behalf of councils and looking at how the proposed action would affect local services if it goes ahead as planned.\"", "source": {"uri": "greenocktelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greenock Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri":

This equates to a rise of 67 pence per hour or 5.2 per cent for a council worker earning around \u00a325,000 based on a 37-hour week.\n\nIn contrast, the COSLA offer of 3.2 per cent equates to \u00a3800 or a 41 pence per hour increase.\n\nThe pay offer difference means that a Scottish council worker would need to earn above \u00a340,000 to match the offer being made to council workers across the UK. This means the lowest paid council workers are being disproportionately hit by COSLA's current pay offer.\n\nGraham McNab, Unite industrial officer, added: \"Unite stands ready to enter into meaningful negotiations at any time but our members need to see a significant shift in the coming days to avert strike action.

As the lowest funded council in Scotland, it's time for the Scottish Government to properly fund our capital city and its services.\n\nI'm extremely concerned about the impact this will have on bin collections and street cleaning services, as well as the cleanliness of our city.

I'd ask residents to please share this information with any friends, family or neighbours who may not be online.\n\nWe'll also be writing out to businesses to encourage them to remind their customers that they can return their litter back to their premises for disposal, and to use reusable packaging where possible. We're also working with our transport and hospitality partners to ensure visitors are aware of the strike and its impact on the city.\n\nI urge the Scottish Government and COSLA to stay round the table with the unions and find a way of averting, what will be, a hugely damaging dispute for Edinburgh - and for Scotland as a whole.\n\nFor the latest advice, guidance and updates on the strike, please visit the dedicated pages on the council's website.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776768", "eventUri": "eng-9776768", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-14", "dateEnd": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 325, "textEnd": 337}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

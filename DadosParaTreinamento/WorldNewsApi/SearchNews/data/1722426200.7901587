{"id": 243313760, "title": "Gender Gap in IFS", "text": "The presence of women in the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) increased by 6.6% to the current 37.8% in the period 2014\u20132022. Remarkably, between 2018 and 2020, the percentage of female recruits in the IFS surpassed 40%. Observers note that the IFS generally has a higher percentage of women compared to other services like the IAS and IPS. While this is undeniable progress, a lot more needs to be done to attain gender parity in the diplomatic corps. Historically, women in the IFS faced numerous challenges, such as being excluded from challenging postings and needing government approval to marry, unlike their male counterparts. Pioneers like CB Muthamma fought against these discriminatory practices in 1979, leading to improvements by the 1980s. Despite these advancements, the IFS remains a relatively small service, an anomaly in the context of India\u2019s self-image as a rising force. Over the years, foreign affairs mavens have called for tripling the number of recruits to address the gender gap and strengthen India\u2019s global presence. Historically, increasing the number of recruits has led to a higher proportion of women joining the service, as seen in 2015, when 17 women were inducted. Currently, women head only eight Indian diplomatic missions and none in major capitals. This is a notable decline from 2008, when women led over 25 missions, including key locations. Today, only one of the seven top-level positions in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is held by a woman. To achieve true gender parity in the IFS, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will have to address the structural and cultural barriers to ensure equal opportunities for women\u2019s advancement and leadership. A more inclusive and representative diplomatic corps will better reflect the values and strengths of a modern India on the world stage. Rapid-fire appointments The NDA government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi isn\u2019t wasting any time. With the new Union Ministers settling into their roles, the Centre is quickly appointing private secretaries to assist them. In the first wave of appointments, private secretaries for Union ministers like Nitin Gadkari, Manohar Lal Khattar, Giriraj Singh and Hardeep Singh Puri were announced. The private secretaries are Shinde Deepak Arjun, Rassal Dwivedi, Raman Kumar, and B Vijay Datta, drawn from the 2010, 2011 and 2012 batches of the IAS. Interestingly, these appointments happened without much input from the ministers themselves, particularly in Gadkari\u2019s case. Subsequently, in the second round, six officers were named as private secretaries to Union ministers. They include Anirudha Sravan Pulipaka of Karnataka cadre as Private Secretary to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. What\u2019s driving this hurry? The urgency is due to the 100-day action plan for ministries and departments crafted by bureaucrats and Niti Aayog officials at Modi\u2019s directive, even before the elections were announced. Plans needing legislative approval or funding will be spotlighted in the upcoming Budget, set to be presented next month. The government is clearly on a mission to hit the ground running, and these swift appointments are just the beginning. Gujarat babus show the way In a generous and touching nod to \u2018ease of doing business\u2019, Gujarat officials are now accepting bribes on an EMI basis to reduce the burden on their victims. Yes, you read that right. These considerate babus have probably taken a leaf from the banking systems, allowing citizens to pay bribes in easy instalments. Gone are the days of scraping together lump sums for bribes. Need to pay a bribe but can\u2019t afford it all at once? No problem! Now, you can spread the cost over several months. For example, earlier this year, someone involved in a State GST bogus billing scam faced a Rs 21 lakh bribery demand. Thankfully, an EMI plan was available: Rs 2 lakh per month for nine months. Similarly, a cybercrime unit officer reportedly demanded Rs 10 lakh but accepted four installments instead. The trend is spreading, sources have informed DKB. In Surat, a deputy sarpanch and a taluka panchayat member demanded Rs 85,000 from a villager to level his farm. But considering the villager\u2019s financial state, they kindly offered an EMI option \u2013 Rs 35,000 down payment and the rest in three instalments. In a more dramatic episode, two cops fled with Rs 4 lakh, the first installment of a Rs 10 lakh bribe they demanded from a resident of Sabarkantha district. They couldn\u2019t wait for the rest! Senior police officials admit that this practice is gaining popularity, with at least 10 such cases reported this year alone. But now the rest of the nation is getting to learn about the hitherto hidden aspects of the fabled Gujarat model. Other states may even be inspired to adopt it! But don\u2019t forget to tip your hat to Gujarat where it began and thank your stars that you need not empty your pockets all at once; just be prepared for a monthly deduction instead.

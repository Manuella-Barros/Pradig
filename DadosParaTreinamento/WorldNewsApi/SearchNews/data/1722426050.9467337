The clash, filled with personal attacks, rambling answers, and dubious claims, quickly turned into a chaotic spectacle that left many Americans both puzzled and amused. Netizens were swift to respond with a deluge of memes that captured the night's absurdity. One user wrote, \u201cBiden's been dead for years??! You heard it here first!\u201d Another user wrote, \u201cJust tuned into the US presidential debate and they're arguing over who loves blacks more, literally doing the meme.\u201d Another user chimed in, \u201cWhen mum asks who the better golfer is.\u201d In agreement, someone else chimed in, \u201cThis presidential debate is WILD.\u201d Someone else echoed a similar emotion and wrote, \u201cMove Chris Wallace.... And whoever comes next, it won't be better. With John Bercow. Could at least be more fun.\u201d As if this wasn\u2019t enough, another user tweeted, \u201cYou know it\u2019s bad when it can be summed up in two #StevenUniverse shots.\u201d Another user remarked, \u201cWhites never get representation. We're just dust in the wind at this point. \"BuT tRuMp AnD bIdEn ArE wHiTe\" No, they're not. They've lost that privilege when they turned their backs on us. Now they're nothing but the toys of zionists. Toys of Israel. Little puppets.? As per The Hill, Trump's performance was marked by a blend of assertive declarations and misleading statements. His claims ranged from accusing Biden of planning to quadruple taxes to downplaying the January 6 Capitol riot. He remarked, \u201cThis guy [Biden] hasn\u2019t fired anybody. He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghanistan [withdrawal] horror show\u2026.I gave him an unbelievable situation with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with\u2026We gave him something great. Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it.\u201d Biden, on the other hand, faced his own challenges. His age and verbal gaffes were highlighted throughout the debate. At one point, he stumbled over his words during a discussion on Medicare. He exclaimed, \u201cMaking sure that we\u2019re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I\u2019ve been able to do with, the eh, COVID. Excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with,\u201d he said, fogging up. \u201cLook\u2026 we finally beat Medicare,\u201d as reported by CNN. One of the more poignant moments came when Biden, defending his late son Beau, retorted to Trump\u2019s past comments and remarked, \u201cHe was standing with his four-star general, and he told me, he said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go in there, because they\u2019re a bunch of losers and suckers,\u2019...My son was not a loser. He\u2019s not a sucker. You\u2019re the sucker. You\u2019re the loser.\u201d The moderators, Dana Bash and Jake Tapper struggled to maintain decorum during the debate. Their attempts to control the debate were met with little to no success, as both candidates frequently interrupted and talked over each other. The lack of real-time fact-checking allowed for a flurry of unchecked statements, leading to even more fodder for netizens. One user criticized, \u201cI wish the CNN moderators did more fact-checking, letting the audience know when things are said that are flatly false. Not sure how it helps for a platform to transmit falsehoods disguised as facts.\u201d", "summary": "<img alt=\"Netizens Call Biden and Trump \u2018Little Puppets\u2019 As Their Tumultuous Debate Takes Over the Internet\" src=\"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/702134/uploads/e1abd990-354b-11ef-856f-8b004e763624_800_420.jpeg\" />\n                One user wrote, \u201cI wish the CNN moderators did more fact-checking, letting the audience know when things are said that are flatly false.

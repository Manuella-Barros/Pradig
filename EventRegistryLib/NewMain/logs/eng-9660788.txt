You can check out at any time. More info\n\nLady Gabriella Windsor has received the public support of the royal family as she made her first major appearance since the death of her husband. The bereaved member of the monarchy was hugged by Zara Tindall during a day at Royal Ascot after she joined the King and Queen's traditional carriage procession.\n\nLady Gabriella, the King's second cousin, looked relaxed as she travelled along the course past stands packed with racegoers in a carriage with the Princess Royal, her son Peter Phillips and Charles and Camilla's racing manager John Warren. The King and Queen are proven fans of racing and waved to the crowds when their carriage entered the parade ring where Zara and her husband, former rugby international Mike Tindall, and other guests were waiting.\n\nPunters dressed in stunning hats, summer dresses and smart suits cheered on the riders during the opening day of the famous Berkshire meet, which attracted a number of famous faces including Penny Lancaster, Nick Knowles and Good Morning Britain co-host Charlotte Hawkins. The event was founded by Queen Anne in 1711 after she declared Ascot ideal for \"horses to gallop at full stretch\", and has today become a major social event as much as a sporting attraction.\n\nWriting in the official programme, Charles and Camilla wished the racegoers the \"best of luck\" in chasing the \"thrill of a Royal Ascot winner\". Royal Ascot 2023 was their first as King and Queen, and the couple - who took on Queen Elizabeth II's thoroughbreds - watched as their horse Desert Hero won the King George V Stakes, their first winner at the famous meet as owners. The late Queen was a passionate owner and breeder of thoroughbreds and had more than 20 Royal Ascot winners during her 70-year reign.\n\nCharles and Camilla wrote: \"It gave us immense pleasure and joy to witness Desert Hero's victory in the King George V Stakes last year, particularly as he was bred by Her late Majesty. We wish all the participants this week the very best of luck in seeking that unique thrill of a Royal Ascot winner. We also hope that those here at the racecourse and watching from home will enjoy five days of the finest racing that this sport has to offer.\"\n\nLady Gabriella's day out came after she was spotted behind the scenes at Buckingham Palace following the Trooping the Colour ceremony on Saturday, when members of the royal family made a balcony appearance. In late February, the daughter of Prince Michael of Kent was left bereaved when her husband Thomas Kingston died from a \"catastrophic head injury\" with a gun found close to his body. In March, Gloucestershire Coroner's Court heard Mr Kingston, 45, died on February 25 at his parents' home in the Cotswolds.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

They were joined by the King's racing manager John Warren.\n\nThe Queen's sister, Annabel Elliot, her nephew Sir Ben Elliot, and the Earl and Countess of Halifax followed in the third carriage. The Countess is the Queen's former sister-in-law, having previously been married to Richard Parker Bowles, the younger brother of Camilla's first husband, Andrew Parker Bowles.\n\nRacehorse trainer Ralph Beckett and former Ascot chairman Sir Johnny Weatherby followed in the fourth carriage, alongside their wives.\n\nIn a joint foreword for the official programme, the King and Queen wished racegoers the \"best of luck\" in chasing the \"thrill of a Royal Ascot winner\".\n\nThe couple will be hoping to add to their own tally of Royal Ascot winners throughout the week.\n\nThe King and Queen have five runners this week, including last year's winner Desert Hero, bred by the late Queen Elizabeth II, who is entered into the Hardwicke Stakes on Saturday.\n\nHard to Resist is entered into the Sandringham Stakes on Friday, while Gilded Water, Treasure and Crown Estate are all running on Thursday, Ladies' Day.\n\nIn the programme, the couple said: \"It gave us immense pleasure and joy to witness Desert Hero's victory in the King George V Stakes last year, particularly as he was bred by Her Late Majesty.\"\n\n\"We wish all the participants this week the very best of luck in seeking that unique thrill of a Royal Ascot winner.\n\n\"We also hope that those here at the racecourse and watching from home will enjoy five days of the finest racing that this sport has to offer.\"\n\nThe late Queen was besotted with the sport and had more than 20 Royal Ascot winners during her 70-year reign.\n\nBut fears her death might signal the demise of such a valuable royal connection have proved unfounded, with the King enthusiastically taking up the mantle.\n\nHis Majesty is expected to attend most days of this year's meeting and his presence will be warmly received by industry insiders, breeders, managers and racegoers alike.\n\nRoyal Ascot was founded by Queen Anne in 1711 after she declared Ascot ideal for \"horses to gallop at full stretch\" and has today become a major social event as well as a sporting attraction.\n\nThe royal procession was started by George IV around 1825.\n\nPunters dressed in stunning hats, summer dresses and smart suits will cheer on the riders over the next five days.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They were joined in their carriage by the Duke and Duchess of Wellington while several of his royal relatives travelled behind in another carriage.\n\nThey include his sister Princess Anne, his nephew Peter Phillips and Lady Gabriella Kingston, whose husband Thomas Kingston, a war hero and financier, was found dead at the age of just 45 at his parents' mansion earlier this year. It is seen by many as an honour to be included in the Royal Ascot Royal Ascot carriage procession on the first day of the race meeting and comes just days after she was spotted at Trooping the Colour - her first public appearance since her husband's death.\n\nOn Saturday, she was seen at a window of Buckingham Palace behind the other royals, who appeared on the balcony to watch the RAF flypast at the climax of the King's Birthday Parade. Since Mr Kingston's sad death, it is believed the royals have been rallying around Lady Gabriella, who is the daughter of Prince and Princess Michael of Kent. She wore a beautiful floral dress complete with a pale pink hat\n\nOther notable attendees in the carriage procession include Charles' racing manager John Warren and Camilla's sister Annabel and her son Sir Ben Elliot. Not in the carriage procession but attending the race meeting today were Mike and Zara Tindall, with Zara giving Lady Gabriella a huge hug on seeing her.\n\nAt the races, Charles and Camilla will be hoping to add to their tally of Royal Ascot winners and cement their position as champions of racing, just like Queen Elizabeth II. The King and his wife took on the late Queen's thoroughbreds and have entered a string of horses over the next five days.\n\nWriting jointly in the official programme, Charles and Camilla said: \"It gave us immense pleasure and joy to witness Desert Hero's victory in the King George V Stakes last year, particularly as he was bred by Her late Majesty. We wish all the participants this week the very best of luck in seeking that unique thrill of a Royal Ascot winner.\n\n\"We also hope that those here at the racecourse and watching from home will enjoy five days of the finest racing that this sport has to offer.\"\n\nThe late Queen was a passionate owner and breeder of thoroughbreds, and had more than 20 Royal Ascot winners during her 70-year reign. Traditionally, the King and Queen arrive at Royal Ascot in a carriage procession with their guests, a convention which will reach its 200th anniversary next year, as it was first held in 1825 during the reign of King George IV.\n\nPunters dressed in stunning hats, summer dresses and smart suits will cheer on the riders over the next five days at the Berkshire race course. It was founded by Queen Anne in 1711 after she declared Ascot ideal for \"horses to gallop at full stretch\" and has today become a major social event as well as a sporting attraction.\n\nRoyal Ascot comes at a busy time for King Charles, who is still undergoing cancer treatment. On Saturday, he was in London for his annual birthday parade Trooping the Colour, and appeared on the palace balcony along with the rest of his family, including the Princess of Wales, who is also having cancer treatment.\n\nMeanwhile, yesterday, he and Camilla, along with Prince William, processed through the grounds of Windsor Castle for the annual Garter Dayb service commemorating the country's oldest and most senior order of chivalry.\n\nCharles and Camilla followed tradition and were at the back of the procession, dressed in white plumed hats and dark blue velvet robes as were the other members of the order, including the Princess Anne and Edward, the Duke of Edinburgh.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Historian IAN LLOYD Shares Details - Internewscast Journal", "body": "They call it the Sport of Kings and with some justification.\n\nHorse racing has attracted British monarchs for centuries and King Charles III is likely to continue the trend this week - if his health allows him to attend Royal Ascot.\n\nIf he again leads the famous Royal Procession, he will be following in the footsteps of the greatest racing fan of them all - his late mother Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn her 70-year reign, the Queen missed the annual jamboree on only a handful of occasions.\n\nAnd, as I reveal below, there have been some very special moments in Royal Ascot's 300-year history.\n\n1. Under starter's orders\n\nAscot racecourse was founded at the start of the 18th Century by another equine loving monarch - Queen Anne.\n\nWhile out riding near Windsor Castle she came upon an area of open heath and decided it would be an ideal place for 'horses to gallop at full stretch.'\n\nThe inaugural event was Her Majesty's Plate, which was worth 100 guineas. Seven horses took part, but the winner's name has been lost to history.\n\nAccording to a contemporary source: 'The Queen, with a brilliant suite, drove over from Windsor Castle to Ascot Common on 11 August 1711, to inaugurate Ascot races and attend Ascot again on the following Monday.\n\n'Her Majesty proceeded along the common with her train of courtiers and other attendants.'\n\nAnne's part in the history of the racecourse is commemorated today with the Queen Anne Stakes, which is run in her memory on the opening day of the meeting.\n\n2. The Royal Procession is born\n\nIt was George IV who instituted one of Ascot's best-loved traditions - the Royal Procession.\n\nThe first formal one took place in 1825, when the King led a procession of carriages along the Straight Mile.\n\nThe diarist Thomas Creevey recorded in a letter to a friend: 'Contrary to his former practice [the King] drove up the course to his stand, in the presence of everybody - himself in the first coach and four, the Duke of Wellington sitting by his side.\n\n'There were three other carriages and four, and a phaeton after him, and I s'd [sic - short for should] think 20 servants in scarlet on horseback.\n\nAs Prince of Wales, George had taken a keen interest in the turf and had his first winner at the course in 1785, when his four-year-old bay filly Rosetta won a two-mile race.\n\nIn 1822 he asked his favourite architect John Nash, (who transformed Buckingham House into a palace and built Clarence House), to design a new Royal Stand for Ascot.\n\nIt was built in just five weeks and The Times described it as 'a light tasteful building, with fluted pilasters of composition supporting the roof, in imitation of a Greek portico.'\n\nLike today's Royal Enclosure, admittance was strictly limited with invitations subject to the King's agreement, even for his own family.\n\n3. Victoria has a smashing time\n\nIn 1854, a 35-year-old Queen Victoria was so excited by the neck and neck finish of the New Stakes that she leapt forward suddenly at the window, clearly forgetting it had been closed due to the rain.\n\nAlthough she smashed the glass with her head, she was unhurt, and The Times reported the injury 'produced a great deal of merriment in the royal party.'\n\nVictoria's first appearance at Ascot was as a fifteen-year-old princess and she loved it from the off.\n\nShe rode in the carriage procession with her half-sister Feodora and noted in her journal: 'The races were very good and there was an immense concourse of people there.'\n\nIn June 1838, to mark her first Ascot as monarch, Victoria inaugurated a new race run over one and a half miles, with a gold vase worth \u00a3200.\n\nIt is now known as the Queen's Vase.\n\nDespite her clear affection for Ascot, the royal meeting was another casualty of Victoria's overwhelming grief following the death of Prince Albert.\n\nAfter he died aged just 42 in 1861, Victoria never returned.\n\n4. Black Ascot\n\nOne of the most memorable royal meetings was in June 1910, held a month after the death of King Edward VII.\n\nWhile the race course management felt that the King would have wanted the Royal meeting to go ahead, racegoers were instructed to wear either full black or a mixture of black and white.\n\nThere was no royal procession, no member of the royal family attended, and the royal pavilion was shuttered and isolated.\n\nAccording to one press report: 'Everybody wore deep mourning and the effect of hundreds of people all in unrelieved black in the Royal stand and on the lawn was rather depressing.'\n\nThere was one bright note half a century later. Royal photographer and designer Cecil Beaton used this unforgettable scene as the inspiration for the black and white costumes he created for the Ascot scene in the 1964 Audrey Hepburn film My Fair Lady.\n\nDubbed 'Edward the Caresser' for his constant womanising, 'Bertie' had been a hugely popular figure at Royal Ascot.\n\nHe made his first visit to the course in 1863 at the age of twenty-one, a year after a new race at the meeting had been named the Prince of Wales Stakes in his honour.\n\nBertie and his wife, Princess Alexandra, revived the Royal Procession and in 1877 were even accompanied by their 12-year-old son, the future George V, and his elder brother Prince Albert Victor.\n\n5. Edward VIII's indiscretion\n\nWhile most Britons did not know of Wallis Simpson until the Abdication Crisis thrust her into the public eye - she and King Edward VIII had been dating for at least two years before December 1936.\n\nBut only the great and good were aware of the scandalous romance which appalled the royal family and enthralled fashionable high society.\n\nAt the Royal Meeting in June 1935, the then Prince of Wales carelessly allowed himself to be photographed with Mrs Simpson and her friends at the course.\n\nWith his father King George V unable to attend Ascot on doctor's orders, Edward accompanied his mother Queen Mary and the Duke and Duchess of York (who would go on to be George VI and Queen Elizabeth) in the first carriage in the traditional procession.\n\nThe eyes of all racegoers were on the charismatic and popular prince, but few realised the significance of the woman he was seen chatting to.\n\n6. The khaki Ascot\n\nThe future Queen Elizabeth II attended her first Royal Ascot just a month after the end of the Second World War.\n\nThere was no royal procession, and few people were aware that Princess Elizabeth was even there as she mingled with the crowds wearing her khaki ATS uniform and holding a pair of leather gloves.\n\nA keen race fan even then, the princess asked if she could see inside the weighing room, where the jockeys are weighed after the race.\n\nIt is one of the most exclusive places in the racecourse and, at the time, 19-year-old Elizabeth was one of the few women to have been allowed inside.\n\n7. The private royal 'race'\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s the Queen would have a private race at Ascot with her family before official proceedings began.\n\nArriving on horseback from Windsor Castle in the morning, before the crowds were admitted, they lined up under starters orders near the Golden Gates and galloped along the Straight Mile towards the finishing line in front of the stands.\n\n8. Fergie finds a royal boyfriend at Ascot\n\nIn June 1985, 25-year-old Sarah Ferguson was invited by the Queen to stay at Windsor Castle as a member of the house party for the four-day royal meeting.\n\nIt was match-maker Princess Diana who had suggested the bubbly redhead to liven up proceedings.\n\nFergie, the daughter of Prince Charles' polo manager, got on very well with Prince Andrew.\n\nShe had been dropped off at the castle by her then partner Paddy McNally, who soon found himself sidelined.\n\n'We both knew the same idiot jokes, we both loved a good prank,' Fergie later recalled.\n\nWhen profiteroles were served for dessert the dieting Sarah tried to resist but Andrew told her that refusing them would be improper etiquette.\n\nFergie said: 'Then when it was his turn to take his portion, he refused - \"No thank you very much!\". I indignantly swatted him on the shoulder with the back of my hand.'\n\nThe pair were engaged by March 1986 and married in a glorious ceremony at Westminster Abbey four months later.\n\nTheir union ended with divorce in 1996, but the former couple still live together at Royal Lodge - even as Andrew now exists as a royal outcast.\n\n9. Queen Wins Gold Cup\n\nIn 2013, a clearly thrilled Elizabeth II made royal racing history by becoming the first reigning monarch to have a horse win the prestigious Gold Cup.\n\nWhen her horse Estimate crossed the finishing line, cameras picked up the euphoric monarch looking ecstatic in the Royal Box.\n\nHer grandson Peter Phillips told reporters: 'It's amazing, this is her passion and her life and she's here every year and she strives to have winners.\n\n'To win the big one at Royal Ascot means so much to her.'\n\n10. Kate delays her Ascot debut\n\nThe late Queen invited Prince William and his wife to join her in the Royal Procession every year from their wedding in 2011 - but it was a full five years before Kate made her Ascot debut.\n\nHer appearance in 2016 was defined by her stunning Dolce and Gabbana white lace dress. She teamed the outfit with a woven gold Jane Taylor hat.\n\nSince then, Kate has been back another four times.\n\nHowever, she and Prince William are yet to buy or train a horse - perhaps a sign that they do not share a devoted interest in the Sport of Kings.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Duke of York, seen talking to the Marchioness of Anglesey and the Duchess of York , next to Lady Mary Lygon in 1929\n\n1. Under starter's orders\n\nAscot racecourse was founded at the start of the 18th Century by another equine loving monarch - Queen Anne.\n\nRead More Charles plans to attend Royal Ascot as he tells aides: 'I want to honour the late Queen's memory'\n\nWhile out riding near Windsor Castle she came upon an area of open heath and decided it would be an ideal place for 'horses to gallop at full stretch.'\n\nThe inaugural event was Her Majesty's Plate, which was worth 100 guineas. Seven horses took part, but the winner's name has been lost to history.\n\nAccording to a contemporary source: 'The Queen, with a brilliant suite, drove over from Windsor Castle to Ascot Common on 11 August 1711, to inaugurate Ascot races and attend Ascot again on the following Monday.\n\n'Her Majesty proceeded along the common with her train of courtiers and other attendants.'\n\nAnne's part in the history of the racecourse is commemorated today with the Queen Anne Stakes, which is run in her memory on the opening day of the meeting.\n\nAscot racecourse was founded at the start of the 18th Century by another equine loving monarch - Queen Anne\n\n2. The Royal Procession is born\n\nIt was George IV who instituted one of Ascot's best-loved traditions - the Royal Procession.\n\nThe first formal one took place in 1825, when the King led a procession of carriages along the Straight Mile.\n\nThe diarist Thomas Creevey recorded in a letter to a friend: 'Contrary to his former practice [the King] drove up the course to his stand, in the presence of everybody - himself in the first coach and four, the Duke of Wellington sitting by his side.\n\n'There were three other carriages and four, and a phaeton after him, and I s'd [sic - short for should] think 20 servants in scarlet on horseback.\n\nKing George IV took a keen interest in horse racing. Above: George, then the Prince of Wales, depicted making his way to Ascot in around 1810\n\nAs Prince of Wales, George had taken a keen interest in the turf and had his first winner at the course in 1785, when his four-year-old bay filly Rosetta won a two-mile race.\n\nIn 1822 he asked his favourite architect John Nash, (who transformed Buckingham House into a palace and built Clarence House), to design a new Royal Stand for Ascot.\n\nIt was built in just five weeks and The Times described it as 'a light tasteful building, with fluted pilasters of composition supporting the roof, in imitation of a Greek portico.'\n\nLike today's Royal Enclosure, admittance was strictly limited with invitations subject to the King's agreement, even for his own family.\n\nKing George IV and the Duke of York depicted watching proceedings at Royal Ascot from the Royal Stand\n\n3. Victoria has a smashing time\n\nIn 1854, a 35-year-old Queen Victoria was so excited by the neck and neck finish of the New Stakes that she leapt forward suddenly at the window, clearly forgetting it had been closed due to the rain.\n\nAlthough she smashed the glass with her head, she was unhurt, and The Times reported the injury 'produced a great deal of merriment in the royal party.'\n\nQueen Victoria had forgotten the window had been closed due to the rain and smashed the glass with her head but was unhurt\n\nQueen Victoria arriving by carriage to Ascot in 1840\n\nVictoria's first appearance at Ascot was as a fifteen-year-old princess and she loved it from the off.\n\nShe rode in the carriage procession with her half-sister Feodora and noted in her journal: 'The races were very good and there was an immense concourse of people there.'\n\nIn June 1838, to mark her first Ascot as monarch, Victoria inaugurated a new race run over one and a half miles, with a gold vase worth \u00a3200.\n\nIt is now known as the Queen's Vase.\n\nDespite her clear affection for Ascot, the royal meeting was another casualty of Victoria's overwhelming grief following the death of Prince Albert.\n\nAfter he died aged just 42 in 1861, Victoria never returned.\n\n4. Black Ascot\n\nOne of the most memorable royal meetings was in June 1910, held a month after the death of King Edward VII.\n\nWhile the race course management felt that the King would have wanted the Royal meeting to go ahead, racegoers were instructed to wear either full black or a mixture of black and white.\n\nThere was no royal procession, no member of the royal family attended, and the royal pavilion was shuttered and isolated.\n\nOne of the most memorable royal meetings was in June 1910, held a month after the death of King Edward VII. Racegoers were instructed to wear either full black or a mixture of black and white. Above: Lady Knaresborough and her daughter, the Honourable Helen Moysey-Thompson and Mr Miller Mundy, wearing mourning clothes at Black Ascot\n\nAccording to one press report: 'Everybody wore deep mourning and the effect of hundreds of people all in unrelieved black in the Royal stand and on the lawn was rather depressing.'\n\nThere was one bright note half a century later. Royal photographer and designer Cecil Beaton used this unforgettable scene as the inspiration for the black and white costumes he created for the Ascot scene in the 1964 Audrey Hepburn film My Fair Lady.\n\nDubbed 'Edward the Caresser' for his constant womanising, 'Bertie' had been a hugely popular figure at Royal Ascot.\n\nHe made his first visit to the course in 1863 at the age of twenty-one, a year after a new race at the meeting had been named the Prince of Wales Stakes in his honour.\n\nBertie and his wife, Princess Alexandra, revived the Royal Procession and in 1877 were even accompanied by their 12-year-old son, the future George V, and his elder brother Prince Albert Victor.\n\nAccording to one press report: 'Everybody wore deep mourning and the effect of hundreds of people all in unrelieved black in the Royal stand and on the lawn was rather depressing'\n\nEdward VII in the Royal Box at Ascot during the visit of King Alfonso of Spain in 1905\n\n5. Edward VIII's indiscretion\n\nWhile most Britons did not know of Wallis Simpson until the Abdication Crisis thrust her into the public eye - she and King Edward VIII had been dating for at least two years before December 1936.\n\nBut only the great and good were aware of the scandalous romance which appalled the royal family and enthralled fashionable high society.\n\nThe Prince of Wales carelessly allowed himself to be photographed with Wallis Simpson and her friends at Royal Ascot in 1935\n\nKing George V and Queen Mary with their sons, Edward, Prince of Wales and Prince Henry at Ascot in the early 1930s\n\nAt the Royal Meeting in June 1935, the then Prince of Wales carelessly allowed himself to be photographed with Mrs Simpson and her friends at the course.\n\nWith his father King George V unable to attend Ascot on doctor's orders, Edward accompanied his mother Queen Mary and the Duke and Duchess of York (who would go on to be George VI and Queen Elizabeth) in the first carriage in the traditional procession.\n\nThe eyes of all racegoers were on the charismatic and popular prince, but few realised the significance of the woman he was seen chatting to.\n\n6. The khaki Ascot\n\nThe future Queen Elizabeth II attended her first Royal Ascot just a month after the end of the Second World War.\n\nThere was no royal procession, and few people were aware that Princess Elizabeth was even there as she mingled with the crowds wearing her khaki ATS uniform and holding a pair of leather gloves.\n\nA keen race fan even then, the princess asked if she could see inside the weighing room, where the jockeys are weighed after the race.\n\nIt is one of the most exclusive places in the racecourse and, at the time, 19-year-old Elizabeth was one of the few women to have been allowed inside.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth stands in front of an ambulance in 1945, when she was serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service\n\nKing George VI and Princess Elizabeth viewing the racing at Ascot from the top of the grandstand, 1946\n\n7. The private royal 'race'\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s the Queen would have a private race at Ascot with her family before official proceedings began.\n\nArriving on horseback from Windsor Castle in the morning, before the crowds were admitted, they lined up under starters orders near the Golden Gates and galloped along the Straight Mile towards the finishing line in front of the stands.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II rides down the course at Ascot with Prince Philip, Prince Charles, the Duke and Duchess of Kent and Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon, June 1968\n\n8. Fergie finds a royal boyfriend at Ascot\n\nIn June 1985, 25-year-old Sarah Ferguson was invited by the Queen to stay at Windsor Castle as a member of the house party for the four-day royal meeting.\n\nIt was match-maker Princess Diana who had suggested the bubbly redhead to liven up proceedings.\n\nFergie, the daughter of Prince Charles' polo manager, got on very well with Prince Andrew.\n\nPrince Andrew walks behind Sarah Ferguson at Royal Ascot in 1985\n\nSarah Ferguson walks with Princess Diana at Ascot in 1985. She became engaged to Andrew the following year\n\nShe had been dropped off at the castle by her then partner Paddy McNally, who soon found himself sidelined.\n\n'We both knew the same idiot jokes, we both loved a good prank,' Fergie later recalled.\n\nWhen profiteroles were served for dessert the dieting Sarah tried to resist but Andrew told her that refusing them would be improper etiquette.\n\nFergie said: 'Then when it was his turn to take his portion, he refused - \"No thank you very much!\". I indignantly swatted him on the shoulder with the back of my hand.'\n\nThe pair were engaged by March 1986 and married in a glorious ceremony at Westminster Abbey four months later.\n\nTheir union ended with divorce in 1996, but the former couple still live together at Royal Lodge - even as Andrew now exists as a royal outcast.\n\n9. Queen Wins Gold Cup\n\nIn 2013, a clearly thrilled Elizabeth II made royal racing history by becoming the first reigning monarch to have a horse win the prestigious Gold Cup.\n\nWhen her horse Estimate crossed the finishing line, cameras picked up the euphoric monarch looking ecstatic in the Royal Box.\n\nHer grandson Peter Phillips told reporters: 'It's amazing, this is her passion and her life and she's here every year and she strives to have winners.\n\n'To win the big one at Royal Ascot means so much to her.'\n\nIn 2013, a clearly thrilled Elizabeth II made royal racing history by becoming the first reigning monarch to have a horse win the prestigious Gold Cup.

Kate delays her Ascot debut\n\nThe late Queen invited Prince William and his wife to join her in the Royal Procession every year from their wedding in 2011 - but it was a full five years before Kate made her Ascot debut.\n\nHer appearance in 2016 was defined by her stunning Dolce and Gabbana white lace dress. She teamed the outfit with a woven gold Jane Taylor hat.\n\nSince then, Kate has been back another four times.\n\nHowever, she and Prince William are yet to buy or train a horse - perhaps a sign that they do not share a devoted interest in the Sport of Kings.\n\nKate made her Royal Ascot debut in 2016 (above).

Now it is very much their garden.\n\n\"The King and Queen's passion is enormously important for the sport.\n\n\"They realise how important the week is, the history, the competition, and its usefulness in terms of soft diplomacy.\"\n\nWoodhams, who like Redvers is seen as one of the most original thinkers in the sport, says it is crucial to keep an eye on the long-term future regarding the Royal Family.\n\n\"It's critical the industry courts Prince William,\" said Woodhams, who came into the industry on the back of six years with luxury goods firm LVMH.\n\n\"The King's racing manager (John Warren) has a talented son (Jake) who might be the key to keeping the House of Windsor engaged.\n\n\"It's the best free publicity a sport can get.\"\n\nOne thing the King and Queen will miss this year is a flying dismount from legend Frankie Dettori -- 'Mr Ascot' to many and with 81 Royal Ascot winners to his credit.\n\nThe exuberant Italian will be back from the United States where he is riding -- having revised his decision to retire last year -- but principally for his daughter Ella's wedding.\n\n\"We do not need Frankie for racing to survive,\" said Redvers.\n\n\"Of course he is a wonderful asset to the sport and a great ambassador too.\n\n\"I think the long goodbye will continue -- and he may be back next year at Ascot -- as he is riding as well as ever.\"", "source": {"uri":

Not just for horse racing fans but the public as well.\n\nThe five-day race meeting provides the best entertainment for all, whether at home, in the grandstand or in the course having a picnic.\n\nHeld from Tuesday to Saturday, it attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators and even more watching from home and around the world.\n\nUltimately, Royal Ascot sets itself apart from other racing events around the world for the spectacle.\n\nThe event is renowned for its glitz and glamour. From the top and tails and dresses in the Royal Enclosure, to the suits and outlandish hats throughout.\n\nAnd there are a few ways this event becomes the spectacle it is, from the people, the horses, the pageantry, the betting and much more.\n\nWhile many racecourses still have their charm, they are in need of some TLC.\n\nBut Ascot is kept in pristine condition. It's inch perfect from the racecourse to the concourse.\n\nThe main grandstand at Ascot has undergone major development that finished in 2006 to offer the most up to date and modern look in horse racing.\n\nThe biggest thing to come from the development is the ability to offer a staggering 80,000 capacity.\n\nOver the years, the capacity for the royal meeting has been reduced slightly to offer those attending the best possible experience, so that paying attendees don't leave feeling Royal Ascot didn't deliver.\n\nWhen it was reopened, the late Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was there to commemorate the redevelopment that cost \u00a3200 million.\n\nThe late Queen was a huge supporter of racing and would attend every year she could, even having a few winners herself as an owner.\n\nEstimate won the coveted Gold Cup in 2013 to give her late Majesty The Queen with a Royal win in the biggest race of the festival.\n\nIt's no surprise to see that Royal Ascot also has heritage and history on its side.\n\nIt's the world's most famous racecourse dating back to the 1700's.\n\nThe course itself was founded in 1711 by Queen Anne, who is still recognised to this day as she has a race at the Royal meeting named after her.\n\nAnd it's proud of its heritage and history, too, with prominent horses also remembered and honoured.\n\nFive-time Ascot winner and racing royalty Frankel, had a statue unveiled on the grounds in 2015, before Frankie Dettori was also immortalised in bronze in 2023 ahead of his retirement from UK racing.\n\nNow based in the US, the jockey rose to fame at this course with his Magnificent 7 on September 28th 1996, riding all seven winners on the card.\n\nAnd each year it's open to shine the spotlight on many others.\n\nAbove everything, racing still takes centre stage, all of which to give the best views possible of the races.\n\nThere's multiple Group races spanning the festival with incredible prize money offered on each race, which sees the very best horses travel to Berkshire from around the world, including the USA, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Australia and France.\n\nEven those who don't often go to sporting events can find themselves at Royal Ascot for the occasion.\n\nRoyal Ascot is a perfectly timed flat racing festival in the summer providing optimal conditions for racing.\n\nEach year, the festival offers incredible value with big favourites cruising home to the delight of thousands of cheering fans urging them to cross the line first.\n\nNon-bettors will still flock to Berkshire or bet online as the best horses put on a great show of high octane racing.\n\nSome of these horses have the ability to run in excess of 40mph and it's made all the more difficult at Ascot, which is a notoriously difficult track to win on.\n\nThere's a few reasons for this; the straight course sees undulating ground, stiff turns and a long galloping round mile.\n\nBut then there's also the handicap races, with big fields giving punters the opportunity to strike gold and pick out big odds winners.\n\nLast year for instance, Valiant Force won at 150/1, to go along with 20, 22/1, 33/1 and 50/1 winners.\n\nAnd each year it offers that same level of hope, potential and entertainment that makes it the best possible festival for racegoers and the public.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_lunn@talksport.com", "name": "Tom Lunn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ascot Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandstand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grandstand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Queen of Great Britain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Gold_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ascot Gold Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankel_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankel (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_(horse_racing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handicap (horse racing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Dettori", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frankie Dettori"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_races", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Group races"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/06/frankie-dettori-celebrates-trophy-riding-826858960.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660788", "eventUri": "eng-9660788", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1996-09-28", "textStart": 2529, "textEnd": 2548}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Not just for horse racing fans but the public as well.\n\nThe five-day race meeting provides the best entertainment for all, whether at home, in the grandstand or in the course having a picnic.\n\nHeld from Tuesday to Saturday, it attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators and even more watching from home and around the world.\n\nThe spectacle\n\nUltimately, Royal Ascot sets itself apart from other racing events around the world for the spectacle.\n\nThe event is renowned for its glitz and glamour. From the top and tails and dresses in the Royal Enclosure, to the suits and outlandish hats throughout.\n\nAnd there are a few ways this event becomes the spectacle it is, from the people, the horses, the pageantry, the betting and much more.\n\nThe course\n\nWhile many racecourses still have their charm, they are in need of some TLC.\n\nBut Ascot is kept in pristine condition. It's inch perfect from the racecourse to the concourse.\n\nThe main grandstand at Ascot has undergone major development that finished in 2006 to offer the most up to date and modern look in horse racing.\n\nThe biggest thing to come from the development is the ability to offer a staggering 80,000 capacity.\n\nOver the years, the capacity for the royal meeting has been reduced slightly to offer those attending the best possible experience, so that paying attendees don't leave feeling Royal Ascot didn't deliver.\n\nWhen it was reopened, the late Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was there to commemorate the redevelopment that cost \u00a3200 million.\n\nThe late Queen was a huge supporter of racing and would attend every year she could, even having a few winners herself as an owner.\n\nEstimate won the coveted Gold Cup in 2013 to give her late Majesty The Queen with a Royal win in the biggest race of the festival.\n\nThe history\n\nIt's no surprise to see that Royal Ascot also has heritage and history on its side.\n\nIt's the world's most famous racecourse dating back to the 1700's.\n\nThe course itself was founded in 1711 by Queen Anne, who is still recognised to this day as she has a race at the Royal meeting named after her.\n\nAnd it's proud of its heritage and history, too, with prominent horses also remembered and honoured.\n\nFive-time Ascot winner and racing royalty Frankel, had a statue unveiled on the grounds in 2015, before Frankie Dettori was also immortalised in bronze in 2023 ahead of his retirement from UK racing.\n\nNow based in the US, the jockey rose to fame at this course with his Magnificent 7 on September 28th 1996, riding all seven winners on the card.\n\nAnd each year it's open to shine the spotlight on many others.\n\nThe racing and horses\n\nAbove everything, racing still takes centre stage, all of which to give the best views possible of the races.\n\nThere's multiple Group races spanning the festival with incredible prize money offered on each race, which sees the very best horses travel to Berkshire from around the world, including the USA, Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Australia and France.\n\nEven those who don't often go to sporting events can find themselves at Royal Ascot for the occasion.\n\nThe betting\n\nRoyal Ascot is a perfectly timed flat racing festival in the summer providing optimal conditions for racing.\n\nEach year, the festival offers incredible value with big favourites cruising home to the delight of thousands of cheering fans urging them to cross the line first.\n\nNon-bettors will still flock to Berkshire or bet online as the best horses put on a great show of high octane racing.\n\nSome of these horses have the ability to run in excess of 40mph and it's made all the more difficult at Ascot, which is a notoriously difficult track to win on.\n\nThere's a few reasons for this; the straight course sees undulating ground, stiff turns and a long galloping round mile.\n\nBut then there's also the handicap races, with big fields giving punters the opportunity to strike gold and pick out big odds winners.\n\nLast year for instance, Valiant Force won at 150/1, to go along with 20, 22/1, 33/1 and 50/1 winners.\n\nAnd each year it offers that same level of hope, potential and entertainment that makes it the best possible festival for racegoers and the public.\n\nGet a \u00a35 match free bet on the first race at Royal Ascot.

And for me, the same applies to the corset.'\n\nFormer One Direction member Harry whose style has included jumpsuits, feather boas, skirts and dresses, became Daniel's first customer after buying all the boxy short-sleeved shirts from the designer's graduate collection in 2015.\n\n'Harry had a huge impact on my career,' Daniel admitted to GQ in 2020.

Dressed in all their finery, the beaming couple looked in great spirits as they arrived side-by-side for the prestigious event at the Berkshire racecourse.\n\nTheir outing comes after their daughter Kate, 42, who has been receiving chemotherapy for an undisclosed form of cancer since February, made a spectacular return to public life during Trooping the Colour on Saturday.\n\nCarole, 69, sporting a \u00a3350 ($445) light blue frock from Self-Portrait for today's outing, has reportedly been supporting Kate through her cancer treatment at her home in Windsor. Michael and his wife's last public appearance was at Kate's annual Royal Carols: Together at Christmas at Westminster Abbey in London in December. Three months later, Kate announced to the world her cancer diagnosis.\n\nMeanwhile, standards have not slipped from yesterday's display of glamorous fashion, and revellers have arrived at the Berkshire racecourse this morning dressed to the nines. Royal Ascot, the jewel in the crown of the UK racing calendar, started yesterday with the Queen Anne Stakes and will run until Saturday.\n\nLisa Snowdon showed her support for the Three Lions competing at the Euros 2024 tomorrow with a patriotic football-themed hat, commissioned by Ladbrokes to tribute the team. The model and television personality, 52, was photographed taking a selfie as she posed in the elaborate red and white hat, which featured the Euros trophy surrounded by small footballs.\n\nIt wasn't just women that pulled out all the sartorial stops at the event, and male racegoers also donned their finest attire. One attendee looked particularly fabulous in a full Scottish ensemble, complete with a bright kilt and cropped blazer.\n\nPunters dressed in stunning hats, summer dresses and smart suits will cheer on the riders over the next five days at the Berkshire racecourse. It was founded by Queen Anne in 1711 after she declared Ascot ideal for 'horses to gallop at full stretch' and has today become a major social event as well as a sporting attraction.\n\nThis year's Royal Ascot will take place over five days beginning on Tuesday, June 18 before ending on Saturday, June 22. The first race of the meeting will get underway at 2:30pm on the Tuesday. The final race of the week is scheduled for 6:15pm on the Sunday.\n\nThis year's meeting will have an overall prize-money pot of \u00a310million ($12m). This is a record amount for Royal Ascot. The minimum winnings for all eight Group 1 races will be \u00a3650,000 ($827k).\n\nYesterday, the King and Queen joined punters at the famous racing meet, with the royal couple likely hoping to add to their tally of Royal Ascot winners.\n\nThey were accompanied by other Royal Family members, including Zara Tindall, Lady Gabriella Windsor, Princess Anne and Peter Phillips, for the occasion. Charles and Camilla took on the late Queen's thoroughbreds and have entered a string of horses over the next five days.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

without her.\n\nHe was spotted chatting with Kate's mum, along with Zara Tindall (the daughter of Princess Anne), and her husband Mike Tindall.\n\nCameras captured William laughing as he helped Carole Middleton out of a tricky situation.\n\nHis mother-in-law, 69, had got her heel stuck in the grass at Ascot Racecourse, so William gallantly offered his hand to help her get her balance.\n\nLater, they were spotted chatting animatedly with Tindall, looking relaxed and comfortable in each other's company.\n\nWhile Kate was absent, plenty of other royals were in attendance on day two.\n\nSpotted throughout the day were Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie with their mother, Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh.\n\nRoyal Ascot is a week-long event held every during the English summer.\n\nThis year's event kicked off on June 18 and runs until June 22.\n\nEach morning, members of the royal family arrive at Ascot Racecourse in horse-drawn carriages before watching the day's races.\n\nRoyal-watchers were hopeful the Princess of Wales may attend at some stage after her stunning appearance at Trooping the Colour on June 15, where she looked well and in good spirits.\n\nBoth King Charles and his daughter-in-law announced earlier this year that they were battling cancer.\n\n\"I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,\" Kate wrote in a social media update on June 14.\n\n\"On those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting.\n\n\"But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.\"\n\nKing Charles attended day one of Royal Ascot with Queen Camilla but was not there for the second day.\n\nThe pair wrote a poignant note in Royal Ascot's official program wishing the horse riders good luck throughout the week.\n\n\"It gave us immense pleasure and joy to witness Desert Hero's victory in the King George V Stakes last year, particularly as he was bred by Her late Majesty,\" the message read.\n\n\"We wish all the participants this week the very best of luck in seeking that unique thrill of a Royal Ascot winner.\n\n\"We also hope that those here at the racecourse and watching from home will enjoy five days of the finest racing that this sport has to offer.\"", "source": {"uri": "7news.com.au",

The royal couple were also joined in their carriage by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.\n\nBut when Charles, sporting a traditional top hat, and Camilla entered their royal enclosure, the Queen was captured looking frustrated as she watched the race with binoculars. Also wearing a white ruched hat with a large flower design and Queen Mary's emerald brooch, Camilla was pictured looking animated, raising her arms in the air and pointing ahead.\n\nCharles, in a grey tail suit paired with a baby blue waistcoat, was also papped pointing towards the racecourse.

In other photos, Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, who wore a white shirt dress with a watercolour floral print, is seen talking to Camilla in the royal enclosure.\n\nAlso in attendance from the Royal Family was equestrian Zara, 43, also also wowed in a baby blue ensemble while her husband Mike, 45, donned a pale grey tail suit also.

Queen Camilla and Prince William arrived in a carriage alongside the Earl and Countess of Halifax.\n\nPrincess Kate, who joined the royals at Trooping the Colour on Saturday, is not expected at Royal Ascot this week.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and his mother-in-law were also joined by royals including his cousin Princess Eugenie, who joined the carriage procession with her husband Jack Brooksbank, as well as Zara Tindall and her husband Mike, and Princess Beatrice as well as his wife's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton. Carole sported a light blue floral dress from Self Portrait while Michael wore the traditional top hat and tails.\n\nThe event was founded by Queen Anne in 1711 after she declared Ascot ideal for \"horses to gallop at full stretch\", and has today become a major social event as much as a sporting attraction.

Three months later, Kate announced to the world her cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn March, Carole was pictured driving a 4\u00d74 Audi, with Kate in the passenger seat, near Windsor Castle. The images were published by US gossip website TMZ.\n\nThen in April, William was spotted on a 'low key' pub outing in Norfolk with his mother-in-law, while his wife stayed at home, The Daily Mail's Richard Eden reported. Carole was said to be staying with the couple over Easter.\n\nFor today's appearance, Carole looked effortlessly elegant in her all blue ensemble as she joined her equally sophisticated husband at Ascot.\n\nHer floral dress appeared reminiscent of Kate's \u00a31,275 blue lace creation by Elie Saab, which she first wore to Royal Ascot in 2019. It also featured a dainty bow and pleated detailing.\n\nProving to be a queen of coordination, Carole teamed her long-sleeved summer dress with a matching light blue fascinator, featuring a statement flower, and a pair of dark blue heels.\n\nWith a stylish clutch bag in hand, she finished off her stunning look with a smattering of glamorous makeup and a pair of gold earrings.\n\nRoyal Ascot, the jewel in the crown of the UK racing calendar, started yesterday with the Queen Anne Stakes and will run until Saturday.\n\nStandards have not slipped from yesterday's display of glamorous fashion, with revellers arriving at the Berkshire racecourse this morning dressed to the nines.\n\nLisa Snowdon showed her support for the Three Lions competing at the Euros 2024 tomorrow with a patriotic football-themed hat, commissioned by Ladbrokes to tribute the team.\n\nThe model and television personality, 52, was photographed taking a selfie as she posed in the elaborate red and white hat, which featured the Euros trophy surrounded by small footballs.\n\nIt wasn't just women that pulled out all the sartorial stops at the event, and male racegoers also donned their finest attire.\n\nOne attendee looked particularly fabulous in a full Scottish ensemble, complete with a bright kilt and cropped blazer.\n\nPunters dressed in stunning hats, summer dresses and smart suits will cheer on the riders over the next five days at the Berkshire racecourse.\n\nIt was founded by Queen Anne in 1711 after she declared Ascot ideal for 'horses to gallop at full stretch' and has today become a major social event as well as a sporting attraction.\n\nThis year's meeting will have an overall prize-money pot of \u00a310million. This is a record amount for Royal Ascot. The minimum winnings for all eight Group 1 races will be \u00a3650,000.\n\nIt comes after Charles's official birthday celebrations on Saturday, where the Princess of Wales made her first public appearance this year.\n\nKate looked relaxed during her first day in the spotlight following her cancer diagnosis for the traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony.\n\nWith the King also suffering from cancer, it was a rare joint public outing for the entire family after a period of uncertainty.\n\nKate rode to the event in a carriage with her children, while William, the Princess Royal and the Duke of Edinburgh were on horseback.\n\nThe King also rode in a carriage with the Queen, a departure from last year because of his illness.\n\nBoth Kate and Charles have thanked the public for their support after going public with their illnesses, with Kate saying she had been 'blown away' by the 'kind messages' that had made a 'world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times'.\n\nKate was initially admitted to hospital for abdominal surgery on January 16 and at the time her condition was thought to be non-cancerous, but cancer was found following the successful operation.\n\nCharles was admitted to hospital just days after Kate, also for a procedure deemed unrelated to cancer.\n\nIn February, Buckingham Palace confirmed that he had been diagnosed with a form of cancer, which is not prostate cancer, that was discovered while the King was being treated at the private London Clinic for an enlarged prostate.\n\nCharles initially postponed public-facing duties but resumed at the end of April, speaking of his 'shock' at being diagnosed with cancer as he met patients during a visit to University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre in central London.\n\nYesterday, the King and Queen joined punters at the famous racing meet, with the royal couple likely hoping to add to their tally of Royal Ascot winners.\n\nThey were accompanied by other Royal Family members, including Zara Tindall, Lady Gabriella Windsor, Princess Anne and Peter Phillips, for the occasion.\n\nCharles and Camilla took on the late Queen's thoroughbreds and have entered a string of horses over the next five days.\n\nThe late Queen was a passionate owner and breeder of thoroughbreds, and had more than 20 Royal Ascot winners during her 70-year reign.\n\nTraditionally, the King and Queen arrive at Royal Ascot in a carriage procession with their guests, a convention which will reach its 200th anniversary next year, as it was first held in 1825 during the reign of King George IV.\n\nFor the first time in its 313-year history, Ascot Racecourse announced this year the appointment of a creative director.\n\nBritish fashion designer Daniel Fletcher was responsible for the creation of the annual Lookbook and Millinery Collective in 2024, which set the style tone for the year and often inspire racegoers' outfits.\n\nFor the first time in its 313-year history, Ascot Racecourse announced this year the appointment of a creative director.\n\nBritish fashion designer Daniel Fletcher was responsible for the creation of the annual Lookbook and Millinery Collective in 2024, which set the style tone for the year and often inspire racegoers' outfits.\n\nHe's known for his classically tailored silhouettes and modern gender-fluid clothes; his Spring/Summer 2023 collection included corset designs for both men and women.\n\nThe Cheshire-born designer, whose first customer was the eccentric Harry Styles, told GQ in 2023: 'The idea of an item of clothing being for a specific gender is such a funny one.\n\n'I understand that something like a bra is designed for function, but when it comes to a shirt, why would we apply gender to something like that? And for me, the same applies to the corset.'\n\nFormer One Direction member Harry whose style has included jumpsuits, feather boas, skirts and dresses, became Daniel's first customer after buying all the boxy short-sleeved shirts from the designer's graduate collection in 2015.\n\n'Harry had a huge impact on my career,' Daniel admitted to GQ in 2020. 'At 24 years old I couldn't believe what was happening.'\n\nSince then, the designer's career has gone from strength to strength, with A-listers including James McAvoy, Robert Pattinson, Eddie Redmayne, Emma Corrin and Emerald Fennell wearing his looks.\n\nThe Central Saint Martins graduate has also designed for some of the world's most prestigious houses including Louis Vuitton, Lanvin and JW Anderson and held the role of Artistic Director for Italian label Fiorucci between 2019 and 2023.\n\nHe was nominated for the LVMH prize in 2017, was a winner of the European Semi- Final of the International Woolmark Prize and named Breakthrough Designer of The Year in the 2020 GQ Men of The Year Awards.\n\nAfter many successful seasons showing his collections on the London Fashion Week schedule, Daniel took part in Netflix's 'Next In Fashion' series which saw him make it to the final.\n\nOf his latest appointment, Daniel said: 'I'm thrilled to be appointed as Ascot's first Creative Director and have thrown myself into the new role.\n\n'I'm keen to encapsulate the rich heritage of the racecourse while embracing the unique dress codes, adding a contemporary twist to bring a flair that Ascot hasn't seen before.\n\n'For 2024, I want to inspire racegoers to push the boundaries with their own unique style and immerse themselves in the opportunity to embrace their own creativity - and what better occasion than Royal Ascot!\n\n'I'm super excited to reveal the next evolution of style direction for the world- renowned brand and can't wait for the vision to become a reality.'",

While King Charles, 75, previously attended this year's festivities on Tuesday, Queen Camilla, 76, is marking her third day straight at the racecourse.\n\nThe pair entered the event during the Royal Procession, which takes place at 2 p.m. local time to kick off every race day. King Charles and Queen Camilla rode in a horse-drawn carriage with the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.\n\nThe second carriage in the procession carried Prince Edward and Sophie, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, alongside the Earl of Snowdon (the late Princess Margaret's son) and Princess Zahra Aga Khan. Edward and Sophie also attended Royal Ascot on June 19, which happened to be their 25th wedding anniversary, although they didn't ride in the Royal Procession.\n\nRelated: Royal Ascot Fashion! Princess Eugenie Sports a Tassel Hat and Sophie Wears White on Wedding Anniversary\n\nPrincess Anne and her husband, Sir Timothy Laurence, traveled in the third carriage with Lady Sarah and Daniel Chatto (the daughter and son-in-law of Princess Margaret).\n\nThe fourth and final carriage in the Royal Procession was occupied by Zara and Mike Tindall with the Duke and Duchess of Richmond and Gordon. While Zara and Mike have attended Royal Ascot all three days this year, Thursday marked their first time riding in the Royal Procession with family members.\n\nFollowing the event's strict dress code requirements for the Royal Enclosure, King Charles and other men in the Royal Procession sported a morning suit and top hat. Men are required to wear morning dress (with color restrictions: black, grey or navy only) with a waistcoat and necktie (\"patterns of a patriotic nature, for example a national flag, are acceptable,\" according to the dress code). Black or grey top hats are required but may be removed inside restaurants, private boxs or other designated areas.\n\nMeanwhile, the dress code calls for women in the Royal Enclosure to wear hats (but fascinators not allowed -- headpieces must have a minimum base diameter of 4 inches). Ladies can wear a dress or skirt falling just above the knee or longer, a trouser suit or a jumpsuit. And no strapless apparel -- shoulder straps must have a minimum width of 1 inch.\n\nRoyal Ascot is a highlight on the royal family's summer calendar, and they were out at the event in full force on June 19. In addition to Queen Camilla, Princess Anne, Prince Edward, Sophie, Zara and Mike (who all attended the following day as well), Prince William, Princess Eugenie, Princess Beatrice, Sarah Ferguson and more all stepped out to watch the races.\n\nCarole and Michael Middleton also joined the event in their first public appearance since daughter Kate Middleton announced her cancer diagnosis. Although the Princess of Wales, 42, made her first outing with the royals over the weekend at Trooping the Colour, she did not attend Royal Ascot with her family. Palace aides emphasized that Princess Kate's appearance at Trooping the Colour didn't signal a full return to royal work or public life as she continues to prioritize her health.\n\n\"She has been doing what's right for her and recovering privately at home. She is dealing with it the best she can,\" a source close to the royal household tells PEOPLE exclusively in this week's cover story.\n\nKing Charles recently resumed public outings amid his own cancer treatment. After spending months working mainly behind the scenes or taking part in small audiences, the King quipped during a May 9 outing to the Royal School of Military Engineering that he was glad to be \"out of my cage.\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

The Order of the Garter ceremony has been held annually since 1948, celebrating the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in the U.K. King Charles, Queen Camilla, Prince William and more took part in the Garter Day procession wearing ceremonial garb: the order's blue velvet robes and hats topped with a white ostrich feather.\n\nLater this month, King Charles and Queen Camilla will host the

While King Charles, 75, previously attended this year's festivities on Tuesday, Queen Camilla, 76, is marking her third day straight at the racecourse.\n\nThe pair entered the event during the Royal Procession, which takes place at 2 p.m. local time to kick off every race day. King Charles and Queen Camilla rode in a horse-drawn carriage with the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.\n\nThe second carriage in the procession carried Prince Edward and Sophie, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, alongside the Earl of Snowdon (the late Princess Margaret's son) and Princess Zahra Aga Khan. Edward and Sophie also attended Royal Ascot on June 19, which happened to be their 25th wedding anniversary, although they didn't ride in the Royal Procession.\n\nPrincess Anne and her husband, Sir Timothy Laurence, traveled in the third carriage with Lady Sarah and Daniel Chatto (the daughter and son-in-law of Princess Margaret).\n\nThe fourth and final carriage in the Royal Procession was occupied by Zara and Mike Tindall with the Duke and Duchess of Richmond and Gordon. While Zara and Mike have attended Royal Ascot all three days this year, Thursday marked their first time riding in the Royal Procession with family members.\n\nFollowing the event's strict dress code requirements for the Royal Enclosure, King Charles and other men in the Royal Procession sported a morning suit and top hat. Men are required to wear morning dress (with color restrictions: black, grey or navy only) with a waistcoat and necktie (\"patterns of a patriotic nature, for example a national flag, are acceptable,\" according to the dress code). Black or grey top hats are required but may be removed inside restaurants, private boxs or other designated areas.\n\nMeanwhile, the dress code calls for women in the Royal Enclosure to wear hats (but fascinators not allowed -- headpieces must have a minimum base diameter of 4 inches). Ladies can wear a dress or skirt falling just above the knee or longer, a trouser suit or a jumpsuit. And no strapless apparel -- shoulder straps must have a minimum width of 1 inch.\n\nRoyal Ascot is a highlight on the royal family's summer calendar, and they were out at the event in full force on June 19. In addition to Queen Camilla, Princess Anne, Prince Edward, Sophie, Zara and Mike (who all attended the following day as well), Prince William, Princess Eugenie, Princess Beatrice, Sarah Ferguson and more all stepped out to watch the races.\n\nCarole and Michael Middleton also joined the event in their first public appearance since daughter Kate Middleton announced her cancer diagnosis. Although the Princess of Wales, 42, made her first outing with the royals over the weekend at Trooping the Colour, she did not attend Royal Ascot with her family. Palace aides emphasized that Princess Kate's appearance at Trooping the Colour didn't signal a full return to royal work or public life as she continues to prioritize her health.\n\n\"She has been doing what's right for her and recovering privately at home. She is dealing with it the best she can,\" a source close to the royal household tells PEOPLE exclusively in this week's cover story.\n\nKing Charles recently resumed public outings amid his own cancer treatment. After spending months working mainly behind the scenes or taking part in small audiences, the King quipped during a May 9 outing to the Royal School of Military Engineering that he was glad to be \"out of my cage.\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

After his official birthday was celebrated at Trooping the Colour on June 15, King Charles joined members of the royal family at Windsor Castle for Garter Day two days later. The Order of the Garter ceremony has been held annually since 1948, celebrating the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in the U.K. King Charles, Queen Camilla, Prince William and more took part in the Garter Day procession wearing ceremonial garb: the order's blue velvet robes and hats topped with a white ostrich feather.\n\nLater this month, King Charles and Queen Camilla will host the

at day 2 of racing", "body": "We revealed the strict dress code for certain Royal Ascot racegoers\n\nTHE most prestigious event in the racing calendar is back, and attendees have pulled out all the stops with their fashion looks.\n\nRoyal Ascot racegoers donned their fanciest dresses and most eye-catching headpieces as they arrived at the famous Berkshire racecourse.\n\nAs is tradition, sky-high heels and hats in all shades of the rainbow have been the order of the day.\n\nAnd of course, the star-studded day wouldn't be complete without a host of recognisable faces attending the festivities.\n\nAs well as bringing a red fascinator, Lisa Snowdon also wore a patriotic football themed hat, commissioned by Ladbrokes to pay tribute to the England team ahead of their clash with Denmark at the Euros.\n\nThe stunning hat is a red and white design, featuring the iconic Euros trophy, and is surrounded by small footballs.\n\nIt's no wonder people have dressed to the nines for the occasion, as each year the royal family flocks to Ascot for the racing bonanza.\n\nThis year Carole and Michael Middleton - parents of the Princess of Wales - arrived in matching pale blue ensembles, following Kate's appearance at Trooping the Colour on Saturday.\n\nThe Royal Ascot dress code varies across different enclosures, with the Royal Enclosure asking guests to stick to top hats and tails for the men.\n\nWomen must wear a dress or skirt falling just above the knee or longer, with shoulder straps a minimum width of 1 inch and hats are compulsory.\n\nThe Queen Anne Enclosure offers a more relaxed dress code, while the Windsor Enclosure is the most relaxed, with no formal dress code but smart attire is encouraged.\n\nRoyal Ascot was founded in 1711 by Queen Anne who, when riding out from Windsor Castle, came across a piece of land \"ideal for horses to gallop at full stretch\" and thus Ascot Racecourse was born.\n\nThe first Royal Meeting took place at Ascot in 1768 and it is now Britain's most popular race meeting, welcoming in excess of 250,000 racegoers across five days.\n\nEach morning the gates open at 10.30am each day, ready for the anticipated first race which kicks off at 2.30pm.\n\nThere are then seven races throughout the day, the last of which commencing at 6.10pm.\n\nAnd, of course, 2pm on each day of racing is the royal procession.\n\nAs well as the racing, there's also lots of other things for the lucky guests to enjoy.\n\nIt's predicted that the fine dining curated by 350 chefs will serve up 220,000 hand-crafted afternoon tea cakes, 7,300 Angus steaks and 3,000 kilos of salmon over the five days.\n\nWhat's more, the Royal Meeting will also serve 220,000 finger sandwiches and 10,000 punnets of mixed berries.\n\nOn the drinks front, 65,000 bottles of Champagne and 100,000 bottles of wine are expected to be consumed.\n\nRoyal Ascot was held behind closed doors in 2020, and in 2021 limited racegoers were admitted after it was selected to take part in a Covid event research programme.\n\nBut, in 2023, approximately 400 helicopters and 1,000 limousines descended on Royal Ascot, with an average of 60,000 racegoers each day.", "source": {"uri":

And for me, the same applies to the corset.'\n\nFormer One Direction member Harry whose style has included jumpsuits, feather boas, skirts and dresses, became Daniel's first customer after buying all the boxy short-sleeved shirts from the designer's graduate collection in 2015.\n\n'Harry had a huge impact on my career,' Daniel admitted to GQ in 2020. 'At 24 years old I couldn't believe what was happening.'\n\nSince then, the designer's career has gone from strength to strength, with A-listers including James McAvoy, Robert Pattinson, Eddie Redmayne, Emma Corrin and Emerald Fennell wearing his looks.\n\nThe Central Saint Martins graduate has also designed for some of the world's most prestigious houses including Louis Vuitton, Lanvin and JW Anderson and held the role of Artistic Director for Italian label Fiorucci between 2019 and 2023.\n\nHe was nominated for the LVMH prize in 2017, was a winner of the European Semi- Final of the International Woolmark Prize and named Breakthrough Designer of The Year in the 2020 GQ Men of The Year Awards.\n\nAfter many successful seasons showing his collections on the London Fashion Week schedule, Daniel took part in Netflix's 'Next In Fashion' series which saw him make it to the final.\n\nOf his latest appointment, Daniel said: 'I'm thrilled to be appointed as Ascot's first Creative Director and have thrown myself into the new role.\n\n'I'm keen to encapsulate the rich heritage of the racecourse while embracing the unique dress codes, adding a contemporary twist to bring a flair that Ascot hasn't seen before.\n\n'For 2024, I want to inspire racegoers to push the boundaries with their own unique style and immerse themselves in the opportunity to embrace their own creativity - and what better occasion than Royal Ascot!\n\n'I'm super excited to reveal the next evolution of style direction for the world- renowned brand and can't wait for the vision to become a reality.'",

And for me, the same applies to the corset.'\n\nFormer One Direction member Harry whose style has included jumpsuits, feather boas, skirts and dresses, became Daniel's first customer after buying all the boxy short-sleeved shirts from the designer's graduate collection in 2015.\n\n'Harry had a huge impact on my career,' Daniel admitted to GQ in 2020. 'At 24 years old I couldn't believe what was happening.'\n\nSince then, the designer's career has gone from strength to strength, with A-listers including James McAvoy, Robert Pattinson, Eddie Redmayne, Emma Corrin and Emerald Fennell wearing his looks.\n\nThe Central Saint Martins graduate has also designed for some of the world's most prestigious houses including Louis Vuitton, Lanvin and JW Anderson and held the role of Artistic Director for Italian label Fiorucci between 2019 and 2023.\n\nHe was nominated for the LVMH prize in 2017, was a winner of the European Semi- Final of the International Woolmark Prize and named Breakthrough Designer of The Year in the 2020 GQ Men of The Year Awards.\n\nAfter many successful seasons showing his collections on the London Fashion Week schedule, Daniel took part in Netflix's 'Next In Fashion' series which saw him make it to the final.\n\nOf his latest appointment, Daniel said: 'I'm thrilled to be appointed as Ascot's first Creative Director and have thrown myself into the new role.\n\n'I'm keen to encapsulate the rich heritage of the racecourse while embracing the unique dress codes, adding a contemporary twist to bring a flair that Ascot hasn't seen before.\n\n'For 2024, I want to inspire racegoers to push the boundaries with their own unique style and immerse themselves in the opportunity to embrace their own creativity - and what better occasion than Royal Ascot!\n\n'I'm super excited to reveal the next evolution of style direction for the world- renowned brand and can't wait for the vision to become a reality.'",

They led the way in the Royal Procession, which typically marks the start of every race day. Four horse-drawn carriages entered the racecourse at precisely 2 p.m. local time to kick off the event.\n\nKing Charles, 75, looked dapper in a suit and top hat, following the event's strict dress code requirements for the Royal Enclosure. Men are asked to sport morning dress (in black, grey or navy only) with a waistcoat and necktie (\"patterns of a patriotic nature, for example a national flag, are acceptable,\" the dress code states). Black or grey top hats are required but can be removed when inside a restaurant, private box or seating areas. Socks must cover the ankle.\n\nQueen Camilla, 76, sported a blue ensemble by one of her go-to designers Fiona Clare with a coordinating hat.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla rode with the Duke and Duchess of Wellington. Traveling in the second carriage were Princess Anne, Peter Phillips, royal racing manager John Warren and Lady Gabriella Kingston (in her second appearance with the royals since the death of her husband, Thomas Kingston).\n\nQueen Camilla's sister Annabel Elliot and her nephew Ben Elliot took part in the Royal Procession as well, riding in the third coach.\n\nAlthough they didn't take part in the Royal Procession, Zara and Mike Tindall were also spotted at the first day of Royal Ascot. King Charles' niece, who won a silver medal in an equestrian event at the 2012 Olympics in London, is a regular at horse racing events.\n\nQueen Elizabeth was a great supporter of the equestrian event, and 24 of her racehorses won at Royal Ascot through the years. Her heir has continued the tradition, and one of the races taking place on June 18 was renamed the King Charles III Stakes. The King is expected to hand out the trophy to the winner of the race.\n\nMeanwhile, Queen Camilla will present the award for the St. James's Palace Stakes, and Princess Anne will congratulate the winner of the Conventry Stakes.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

After spending months working mainly behind the scenes or taking part in small audiences, the King quipped during a May 9 outing to the Royal School of Military Engineering that he was glad to be \"out of my cage.\"\n\nHe was honored on June 15 at Trooping the Colour, the British Army's annual celebration of the British monarch's birthday in London. Instead of riding on horseback as he did in previous years, King Charles took part in the procession through the city seated in a horse-drawn carriage alongside Queen Camilla.\n\nTwo days later, King Charles joined members of the royal family at Windsor Castle for Garter Day. The Order of the Garter ceremony has been held annually since 1948, celebrating the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in the U.K. King Charles, Queen Camilla, Prince William and more took part in the Garter Day procession wearing ceremonial garb: the order's blue velvet robes and hats topped with a white ostrich feather.\n\nLater this month, King Charles and Queen Camilla will host the Emperor and Empress of Japan during their state visit to the U.K.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And for me, the same applies to the corset.'\n\nFormer One Direction member Harry whose style has included jumpsuits, feather boas, skirts and dresses, became Daniel's first customer after buying all the boxy short-sleeved shirts from the designer's graduate collection in 2015.\n\n'Harry had a huge impact on my career,' Daniel admitted to GQ in 2020. 'At 24 years old I couldn't believe what was happening.'\n\nSince then, the designer's career has gone from strength to strength, with A-listers including James McAvoy, Robert Pattinson, Eddie Redmayne, Emma Corrin and Emerald Fennell wearing his looks.\n\nThe Central Saint Martins graduate has also designed for some of the world's most prestigious houses including Louis Vuitton, Lanvin and JW Anderson and held the role of Artistic Director for Italian label Fiorucci between 2019 and 2023.\n\nHe was nominated for the LVMH prize in 2017, was a winner of the European Semi- Final of the International Woolmark Prize and named Breakthrough Designer of The Year in the 2020 GQ Men of The Year Awards.\n\nAfter many successful seasons showing his collections on the London Fashion Week schedule, Daniel took part in Netflix's 'Next In Fashion' series which saw him make it to the final.\n\nOf his latest appointment, Daniel said: 'I'm thrilled to be appointed as Ascot's first Creative Director and have thrown myself into the new role.\n\n'I'm keen to encapsulate the rich heritage of the racecourse while embracing the unique dress codes, adding a contemporary twist to bring a flair that Ascot hasn't seen before.\n\n'For 2024, I want to inspire racegoers to push the boundaries with their own unique style and immerse themselves in the opportunity to embrace their own creativity - and what better occasion than Royal Ascot!\n\n'I'm super excited to reveal the next evolution of style direction for the world- renowned brand and can't wait for the vision to become a reality.'",

The Duke served as Elizabeth II's representative at Ascot from 1980 until 2011.\n\nThe Queen wore a white silk crepe Dior dress, with the late Queen's Ladies of India emerald brooch, which originally belonged to Queen Mary, and a Philip Treacy hat.\n\nThe King, making a welcome return having missed Wednesday's meet, looked delighted to be back, doffing his hat to acknowledge the rousing three cheers that followed the national anthem.\n\nFollowing behind were the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, accompanied by the Earl of Snowdon and Princess Zahra Aga Khan, the Aga Khan's daughter, who is a huge fan of the sport and is heavily involved in her father's racing empire.\n\nIn the third carriage were the Princess Royal and her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, with Lady Sarah Chatto and her husband, Daniel Chatto.\n\nZara and Mike Tindall were in the fourth carriage, alongside the Duke and Duchess of Richmond and Gordon, the owners of the Goodwood Estate in Sussex.\n\nThe King could not resist admiring the Windsor Greys and having a chat to the coachman before making his way down the receiving line, led by Sir Francis Brooke, the chairman of Ascot and His Majesty's representative.\n\nThe event marked the Queen's third consecutive day at the races. The King, who is still undergoing cancer treatment, was making his second appearance.\n\nThe Princess Royal and her daughter Zara, both former Olympic equestrians, have been at Ascot every day, although it was the Tindalls' first appearance in the carriage procession.\n\n'I've come as an English rose'\n\nLadies' Day offers racegoers the chance to up the ante in the fashion stakes and put on a display of colour and creativity.\n\nOne racegoer was sporting a replica owl, with its wings spread, as a hat, while another wore a wide-brimmed lattice design she peered through. One woman chose a collection of children's toys on a faux grassy bank for her headwear.\n\nGemma Mattison, 41, from Birmingham donned a large red rose as a hat and said she wanted to make a statement on Ladies' Day.\n\n\"I always have a classic look when I come to Royal Ascot, but this time I thought I'd go all out - it's now or never,\" she said. \"So I've come as an English rose.\"\n\nAmong the

The piece was gifted to Queen Mary in 1911 when she attended the Delhi Durbar, the coronation in India.\n\nThe pair were joined by their keen equestrian niece Zara Tindall and her husband Mike.\n\nZara, 43, wowed in an all blue Rebecca Vallance dress and bespoke Hettie by Tusting clutch bag as she rode in a carriage alongside husband Mike and The Duke and Duchess of Richmond and Gordon.\n\nAlso attending was Zara's mother Princess Anne - who is also an Olympic Equestrian - and her husband Sir Admiral Timothy Laurence.\n\nThe daughter of billionaire Aga Khan's, Princess Zahra Aga Khan, joined the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh in another carriage.\n\nPrincess Margaret's children, the Earl of Snowdon and Lady Sarah Chatto also joined the royal procession.\n\nGlamorous racegoers have put their best fashion foot forward as they arrived at Royal Ascot in the sunshine today.\n\nFloral summer dresses, vibrant frocks and eye-catching headpieces were all on display as thousands of revellers descended on the Berkshire racecourse this morning.\n\nShowstopping headwear appeared to be the order of the day, with radiant racegoers showcasing an array of fabulous fascinators and quirky hats.\n\nOne guest decided to stand out from the crowd with a balloon-themed headpiece, while another opted for a firework-themed creation.\n\nRoyal Ascot, the jewel in the crown of the UK racing calendar, started on Tuesday with the Queen Anne Stakes and will run until Saturday.\n\nRadiant guests turned the racecourse into a sea of colourful ensembles as they stepped out for the prestigious occasion.\n\nThose trying to command attention amongst the crowd of thousands opted for unique headwear - including a unicorn-themed creation and even an owl design.\n\nNovelty hats appeared to be the biggest trend of the day, with one person turning up with a burger inspired hat and another showing off a chessboard fascinator.\n\nThe wacky, gravity-defying style of hats are permitted in most of the areas at Ascot, except from the Royal Enclosure.\n\n'A hat or headpiece with a solid base of four inches in diameter is mandatory in the Royal Enclosure,' explained the Royal Ascot website.\n\n'Fascinators are not permitted. Novelty hats (i.e. ones which are excessively oversized, or are promoting or marketing any product or brand) are not permitted.'\n\nThis year's meeting will have an overall prize-money pot of \u00a310million. This is a record amount for Royal Ascot. The minimum winnings for all eight Group 1 races will be \u00a3650,000.\n\nIt was founded by Queen Anne in 1711 after she declared Ascot ideal for 'horses to gallop at full stretch' and has today become a major social event as well as a sporting attraction.\n\nFor the first time in its 313-year history, Ascot Racecourse announced this year the appointment of a creative director.\n\nBritish fashion designer Daniel Fletcher was responsible for the creation of the annual Lookbook and Millinery Collective in 2024, which set the style tone for the year and often inspire racegoers' outfits.\n\nHe's known for his classically tailored silhouettes and modern gender-fluid clothes; his Spring/Summer 2023 collection included corset designs for both men and women.\n\nThe Cheshire-born designer, whose first customer was the eccentric Harry Styles, told GQ in 2023: 'The idea of an item of clothing being for a specific gender is such a funny one.\n\n'I understand that something like a bra is designed for function, but when it comes to a shirt, why would we apply gender to something like that? And for me, the same applies to the corset.'\n\nFormer One Direction member Harry whose style has included jumpsuits, feather boas, skirts and dresses, became Daniel's first customer after buying all the boxy short-sleeved shirts from the designer's graduate collection in 2015.\n\n'Harry had a huge impact on my career,' Daniel admitted to GQ in 2020. 'At 24 years old I couldn't believe what was happening.'\n\nSince then, the designer's career has gone from strength to strength, with A-listers including James McAvoy, Robert Pattinson, Eddie Redmayne, Emma Corrin and Emerald Fennell wearing his looks.\n\nThe Central Saint Martins graduate has also designed for some of the world's most prestigious houses including Louis Vuitton, Lanvin and JW Anderson and held the role of Artistic Director for Italian label Fiorucci between 2019 and 2023.\n\nHe was nominated for the LVMH prize in 2017, was a winner of the European Semi- Final of the International Woolmark Prize and named Breakthrough Designer of The Year in the 2020 GQ Men of The Year Awards.\n\nAfter many successful seasons showing his collections on the London Fashion Week schedule, Daniel took part in Netflix's 'Next In Fashion' series which saw him make it to the final.\n\nOf his latest appointment, Daniel said: 'I'm thrilled to be appointed as Ascot's first Creative Director and have thrown myself into the new role.\n\n'I'm keen to encapsulate the rich heritage of the racecourse while embracing the unique dress codes, adding a contemporary twist to bring a flair that Ascot hasn't seen before.\n\n'For 2024, I want to inspire racegoers to push the boundaries with their own unique style and immerse themselves in the opportunity to embrace their own creativity - and what better occasion than Royal Ascot!\n\n'I'm super excited to reveal the next evolution of style direction for the world- renowned brand and can't wait for the vision to become a reality.'",

From quirky to elegant, hats were the main feature of the day as racegoers showcased their fabulous headwear\n\nSpot on! This racegoer was effortlessly elegant in her monochrome outfit as she arrived at the third day of Royal Ascot\n\nA bit of all white! This radiant woman showcased a stunning hat as she posed for the camera\n\nHat's how you do Ladies Day! Racegoers show off their finest frocks as they attend the event at Royal Ascot\n\nLady in red! A woman opts for a matching scarlet dress and hat as she steps out at Ladies Day\n\nThis year's meeting will have an overall prize-money pot of \u00a310million. This is a record amount for Royal Ascot. The minimum winnings for all eight Group 1 races will be \u00a3650,000.\n\nIt was founded by Queen Anne in 1711 after she declared Ascot ideal for 'horses to gallop at full stretch' and has today become a major social event as well as a sporting attraction.\n\nFor the first time in its 313-year history, Ascot Racecourse announced this year the appointment of a creative director.\n\nBritish fashion designer Daniel Fletcher was responsible for the creation of the annual Lookbook and Millinery Collective in 2024, which set the style tone for the year and often inspire racegoers' outfits.\n\nHe's known for his classically tailored silhouettes and modern gender-fluid clothes; his Spring/Summer 2023 collection included corset designs for both men and women.\n\nThe Cheshire-born designer, whose first customer was the eccentric Harry Styles, told GQ in 2023: 'The idea of an item of clothing being for a specific gender is such a funny one.\n\n'I understand that something like a bra is designed for function, but when it comes to a shirt, why would we apply gender to something like that? And for me, the same applies to the corset.'\n\nFormer One Direction member Harry whose style has included jumpsuits, feather boas, skirts and dresses, became Daniel's first customer after buying all the boxy short-sleeved shirts from the designer's graduate collection in 2015.\n\nPerfect polka dots: Glamorous racegoers (including TV presenter Louise Roe, pictured left), showcase their patterned dresses\n\nBringing the sunshine! A racegoer stuns in a yellow floral and polka dot dress and matching hat\n\nThe bigger, the better when it comes to these hats! These women commanded attention with their over-the-top headwear\n\n'Harry had a huge impact on my career,' Daniel admitted to GQ in 2020. 'At 24 years old I couldn't believe what was happening.'\n\nSince then, the designer's career has gone from strength to strength, with A-listers including James McAvoy, Robert Pattinson, Eddie Redmayne, Emma Corrin and Emerald Fennell wearing his looks.\n\nThe Central Saint Martins graduate has also designed for some of the world's most prestigious houses including Louis Vuitton, Lanvin and JW Anderson and held the role of Artistic Director for Italian label Fiorucci between 2019 and 2023.\n\nHe was nominated for the LVMH prize in 2017, was a winner of the European Semi- Final of the International Woolmark Prize and named Breakthrough Designer of The Year in the 2020 GQ Men of The Year Awards.\n\nAfter many successful seasons showing his collections on the London Fashion Week schedule, Daniel took part in Netflix's 'Next In Fashion' series which saw him make it to the final.\n\nOf his latest appointment, Daniel said: 'I'm thrilled to be appointed as Ascot's first Creative Director and have thrown myself into the new role.\n\nGlamorous guest arrive for Ladies Day at the Berkshire racecourse\n\nPhotographers take pictures of Louise Roe as she attends day three of Royal Ascot 2024\n\nPolice are pictured at Royal Ascot as racegoers arrive for Ladies Day at the Berkshire racecourse\n\n'I'm keen to encapsulate the rich heritage of the racecourse while embracing the unique dress codes, adding a contemporary twist to bring a flair that Ascot hasn't seen before.\n\n'For 2024, I want to inspire racegoers to push the boundaries with their own unique style and immerse themselves in the opportunity to embrace their own creativity - and what better occasion than Royal Ascot!\n\n'I'm super excited to reveal the next evolution of style direction for the world- renowned brand and can't wait for the vision to become a reality.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

When I got quoted, it was a fantastic amount of money.\n\n\"But I don't want it getting wrecked.\"\n\nTim admitted that while sometimes he goes to the races, he also has gone on holiday when they are on.\n\nHe said: \"It's hectic and you do get the things people hear about - like drunk people coming into the garden to try take a p*ss. It's definitely worse on Ladies' Day.\n\n\"You also have to be careful about what you leave outside as one year our garden deck chairs got stolen.\n\n\"But it's only one week a year and it makes so much money for the area. I understand that it's good for people's jobs.\"\n\nJon Grimes, who also lives near to the racecourse, loves Royal Ascot. He says it's a \"wonderful\" part of living in the area.\n\n\"I absolutely love it. It's wonderful. It's one of the reasons you live here, right?,\" he said.\n\nHe recalled that his children used to sell homemade refreshments from the front garden when they were younger.\n\nThe 52-year-old said: \"People around here get involved - our kids used to sell lemonade and brownies out the front of the house so they'd make some good pocket money.\n\n\"They're a bit too old to have the 'cute' factor to do that now but it was fun when they did and I know others do similar things.\"\n\nFellow Ascot resident Brian Greatorex, 68, turns his driveway into a carpark for the week when he can.\n\nHe said: \"The official car parks cost \u00a345 - so if you offer your driveway for \u00a330...\n\n\"We've had five cars a day in here before so you can make good money. Bookies are regular customers.\"\n\nOlga Klocek, assistant manager at Fego Cafe on Ascot High Street, said: \"We're very busy during the races which is good for business.\n\n\"People come in and get breakfast or brunch before they start the day.\n\n\"We make sure we get more staff in - and we shorten the menu so it's easier for the chefs. But we do add a few cocktails to the menu as that's a bit of fun.\"\n\nFortunately, Olga and her team have generally had good experiences with customers - despite stories of rowdy and drunken behaviour.\n\nShe said: \"We don't really see the really drunk people as we're more a morning than an evening place. In my experience, the customers have always been very nice.\n\n\"It's actually a fun day. You feel stressed the day before trying to get everything ready but on the day it's exciting.

'I felt like the stars had aligned and I can die happy now,' she said as she watched the Coronation...\n\nThe grand opening of Royal Ascot was a truly heartwarming experience.\n\nArriving at the Berkshire racecourse for the first time, I immediately made my way to the parade ring to secure a front-row view of the famous carriage procession.\n\nDating back to 1711, the event has featured the procession since 1825, when King George IV led four coaches up the Straight Mile.\n\nSurrounded by fellow royal enthusiasts, I eagerly awaited the two o'clock royal appearance, promptly followed by the Queen Anne Stakes, the first race of the day.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla led the carriage procession at Royal Ascot on Tuesday\n\nMailOnline's senior features writer Rebekah Absalom attended the races for the first time\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla were the first to arrive, accompanied by their close friends, the Duke and Duchess of Wellington.\n\nThere was some uncertainty regarding Charles's attendance due to ongoing cancer treatment, but it was encouraging see him looking well and waving to the jubilant crowd.\n\nCamilla appeared radiant in a cobalt coat dress designed by her go-to couturier, Fiona Clare, adorned with Prince Albert's Diamond and Sapphire Brooch.\n\nShe expertly accessorised with a Philip Treacy hat, her reliable Eliot Zed shoes and a Smythson clutch.\n\nAlthough I had previously seen the royal couple at Sandringham Flower Show in 2022, there was something profoundly moving about witnessing them in person, especially considering Charles's ongoing cancer treatment.\n\nI felt a deeply emotional sense of respect for the King and Queen - and, judging by the reactions of those around me, it seemed I was not alone in experiencing this.\n\nLady Gabriella Windsor, whose husband Thomas Kingston died in February, was seated beside Princess Anne in the second carriage\n\nAs the second carriage approached, I was pleasantly surprised to see Lady Gabriella Windsor seated beside Princess Anne.\n\nOn the opposite side were Anne's son, Peter Phillips, and John Warren, the late Queen Elizabeth's racing manager, who now oversees the King's horses.\n\nLady Gabriella, displaying resilience after the tragic loss of her husband Thomas Kingston in February, was making a second appearance in a matter of days after her outing at Trooping the Colour at the weekend.\n\nIt was heartwarming to see the support she received from other royals, including a bear hug from Zara Phillips.\n\nThe royal stunned in a floral Catherine Walker dress, complemented by a Philip Treacy hat, Bottega Veneta clutch and Jimmy Choo pumps.\n\nHorses preparing to race are shown to crowds in the parade ring\n\nThousands of racegoers gathered to watch the first race of the day\n\nVisitors at Royal Ascot on Tuesday were treated to blue skies and sunshine\n\nIndeed, it was the impeccable attire of the royals that set the tone for the day.\n\nThousands of other racegoers showcased colourful ensembles and exquisite headwear - often from LK Bennett, one of Royal Ascot's official sponsors.\n\nThe high street brand has created a capsule collection of clothing, shoes and accessories for of the four enclosures, whether it be the prestigious Royal Enclosure or the more relaxed Windsor Enclosure.\n\nIn March, Ascot unveiled its annual lookbook under the artistic direction of British fashion designer, Daniel Fletcher, offering visitors plenty of style inspiration.\n\nThis marked a significant and historic change for the British racing institution as it appointed a creative director for the first time in its 300-year history.\n\nHaving recently interviewed milliner Jess Collett, responsible for the exquisite coronation headpieces worn by the Princess of Wales and Princess Charlotte, I was thrilled to wear her 'Cavendish' hat on day one of Royal Ascot.\n\nIt paired perfectly with a vintage-inspired polka dot dress from Beulah and an Aspinal of London bag.\n\nI completed my outfit with mid-heeled sandals from LK Bennett's coveted collection, saving a pink floral dress with statement puff sleeves for later in the week.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband sported his favourite Roderick Charles herringbone suit, with a complementary Moss waistcoat, Liberty tie and Loake loafers.\n\nWe savored the ambiance - a blend of attendees placing bets and enthusiastically cheering for their chosen horses, while others sat back and indulged in the plentiful food and drink options.\n\nThe four enclosures house various eateries and bars, ranging from gourmet fine dining to food stalls on the green.\n\nThere are also expansive picnic lawns for guests to enjoy their own food, if the weather permits, though it must be kept in a cool bag or hamper.\n\nWe noticed that Mo\u00ebt & Chandon champagne, another sponsor, was readily available, tempting us to have a glass or two.\n\nFollowing the final race - the Copper Horse Handicap, brilliantly won by Belloccio (William Buick) - the day concluded with traditional singing around the Bandstand.\n\nHundreds of revelers joined in, singing along to a medley of hits, including 'Angel's by Robbie Williams and Frank Sinatra's 'I Love You Baby'.\n\nIt created a fantastic atmosphere, ensuring the day ended on a high note, regardless of race outcomes.", "source":

Picture: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images\n\nRoyal Ascot is not the same without its two most charismatic and iconic figures of many decades - Queen Elizabeth II and Frankie Dettori.\n\nThe racing-mad monarch and the exuberant jockey couldn't go on forever lighting up the world's most glamorous race meeting, of course. But, this week, the thousands and millions who throng to the racecourse in southern England and watch the action on television around the world will feel some magic is missing.\n\nThe quality of the horse racing will be as high as ever, the prize money is at record levels and everyone will still be amusingly dressed to the nines in archaic garb.\n\nYet old-timers will hanker for Her Highness and for Frankie's victory leap from the saddle, a la the day of his Magnificent Seven clean sweep of the card in 1996.\n\nThis mood of nostalgia mingled with melancholy might have informed an article in The Guardian newspaper this week, suggesting horse racing might be on a downward trajectory. Racing writer Greg Wood points to declining crowd numbers at recent big race meetings, a cost-of-living crisis, likely legislation on affordability checks for punters, and the UK's general downbeat mood.\n\nBut another article in The Guardian, penned by \"wealth correspondent\" Rupert Neate, strikes a quite different note.\n\nNeate looks at an annual auction staged by the company Goffs on the Monday before Tuesday's Royal Ascot opening.\n\n\"Come to Kensington Gardens on the Monday, buy a racehorse and by the Tuesday you will be in the parade ring at one of the world's most famous racecourses (Royal Ascot) alongside members of the British royal family and other royal families, with your own racehorse in your colours.\"\n\nThis is the enticing pitch of Henry Beeby, Goffs CEO, for young, super-rich Tiktokkers and Instagrammers.\n\nBeeby talks about targeting \"the fastest-growing group of UHNWIs (ultra-high net worth individuals) - millennials\".\n\nThese people don't remember or care about Frankie or Liz, reckons Beeby. Posh horse racing with its top hat and tails dress code and free-flowing champagne should be a natural fit for a growing number of wealthy young people who like to boast about their privileged lives on social media.\n\nAnd, of course, social media posts often gather significant followings. Thus, racehorses can acquire significant fan clubs, potentially spanning the globe.\n\nWhether racing should be encouraging this sort of thing is questionable - to traditional racegoers. But money talks and something's got to be done to maintain and preserve the sport of kings, says Beeby.\n\nHe theorises that not only are rich millennials an obvious target because of current ready cash, they are about to become even richer as \"the great wealth transfer\" flows to the children of an older generation of super-rich people in the UK - who are predicted to pass on \u00a356-trillion (roughly R1.3-quadrillion, seriously) over the next 20 years.\n\n\"There's nothing quite like the thrill of ownership,\" Beeby said. \"There's nothing like seeing your horse and your jockey in your colours on the track, and - my word - if it happens to win and you can share that joy with your friends.\"\n\nAt last year's pre-Ascot sale, on Perks Field in the normally private grounds of Kensington Palace, Beeby sold 11 horses for a total of \u00a33.8-million (R87.4-million).\n\nMeanwhile, back in South Africa, the 2024 Royal Ascot will still make for compulsive TV viewing - and compelling punting.\n\nFor die-hard royalists, King Charles will be there to uphold the traditions of \"Mummy\". Last year he ignored his medical advisors to attend all five days of the meeting - and he and Camilla even had a winner with their horse Desert Hero. The royal couple have several runners this week and Ascot has\n\nrenamed Tuesday's Group One sprint the King Charles III Stakes.\n\nMeeting highlights include Wednesday's Prince of Wales's Stakes, which features the clash of Auguste Rodin, 2023 Epsom Derby champ, and prolific Group 1-winning mare Inspiral. The venerable Gold Cup is on Thursday and sees popular 2022 winner Kyprios trying to regain his title.", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors":

At one point between the procession, William looked over to where his aunt Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, the husband of Princess Anne, were watching the spectacle and grinned.\n\nAnd body language expert Darren Stanton says a smiling William gave away a lot about his feelings for the event. He explained: \"William was displaying genuine interest in the ceremony. He maintained strong eye contact and showed authentic smiles, with his whole face engaged. He also winked at the camera and gave a huge grin, which suggests he's in good spirits, but also not afraid to be in a playful and mischievous mood.\"\n\nDarren, speaking on behalf of Betfair Slots, added: \"It reveals he's in a good place and feeling very confident about himself. It also means he wanted to step out of his usual character a bit.\n\n\"The fact he's able to do that so freely means he's really found his feet and feels completely relaxed during occasions like these. It's clear he was happy to see so many turn up to show their support at Windsor.\"\n\nAnd Darren believes William appeared to be taking the ceremony differently from his father King Charles. He explained: \"Straight away, The King and Queen are taking everything in their stride. They have displayed a mixture of emotions together. Charles on one hand comes across as solemn and focused, he's taking it very seriously and wants to show he's there to represent the firm.\n\n\"Although he's interacting with Camilla as they're walking in, he's concentrating very hard and doesn't want to feel distracted. His eye contact remained strong with few instances of him loosening up. He was very aware of how he was coming across. Camilla is seen smiling and is a lot more relaxed. These smiles are genuine and authentic, she doesn't feel forced in any way.\n\n\"It tells us she feels in her element and you can tell she enjoys attending these Royal engagements with Charles. It comes very naturally to her. She was seen walking with a purpose and lots of confidence, as her posture was held upright.\"\n\nGarter Day yesterday kicks off a busy week for the Royal Family. Today Royal Ascot starts and Charles and Camilla wished racegoers the \"best of luck\" in chasing the \"thrill of a Royal Ascot winner\" as the famous meet began.\n\nCharles and Camilla are proven fans of racing and are expected to arrive at the Berkshire racecourse in the traditional carriage possession ahead of the first race. Punters dressed in stunning hats, summer dresses and smart suits will cheer on the riders over the next five days at the Berkshire race course.

These smiles are genuine and authentic, she doesn't feel forced in any way.\n\n\"It tells us she feels in her element and you can tell she enjoys attending these Royal engagements with Charles.

The late royal, who died in 1997, was able to turn the pavement on the way to the racing event into her own personal runway, fashioning bold colors, patterns and more when she attended the annual royal event.\n\nBy 1985, Princess Diana was a phenomenon in the British royal family. The stylish royal attended Royal Ascot this year wearing a look by Jan Van Velden and a hat by Frederick Fox. The sophisticated ensemble featured a featured a pussy bow and high neckline. This look may have been the same Jan Van Velden ensemble Princess Diana wore to Trooping the Colour the same year.\n\nIn 1987, Princess Diana elevated her royal wardrobe by playing with stripes at the Royal Ascot event. She wore this striped suit by Roland Klein with a complementary hat by Philip Somerville. She also wore gloves to accentuate the ensemble and accessorized with pearl jewelry.\n\nFor her 1988 appearance at Royal Ascot, Princess Diana went with one of her go-to designers. The late Princess of Wales wore this suit with a white dress and gray coat with sharp shoulders courtesy of Catherine Walker. She completed the look with a hat designed by Philip Somerville.\n\nIn 1990, Princess Diana chose another Catherine Walker ensemble, this time in bold, contrasting colors. The royal wore a pink suit with sapphire blue pops of color on the buttons, lapels and trim of the pockets. She coordinated with a statement hat.\n\nFor one of her last appearances at Royal Ascot before her separation and ultimate divorce from then-Prince Charles, Princess Diana fashioned this pink look with a coordinated pink hate with black trim. She wore pearls to accessorize the ensemble.\n\nRoyal Ascot is an annual occasion that often takes place during the month of June. Ascot itself is a famous racecourse, and Royal Ascot falls over a series of days in June and features horse races, colorful attire and more. Members of the British royal family attend the social event of the summer season regularly, with the monarch making an appearance nearly each year.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ascot Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Fox_(milliner)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frederick Fox (milliner)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_bow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pussy bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Walker_(fashion_designer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Walker (fashion designer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooping_the_Colour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trooping the Colour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pearl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sapphire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IoEE6bPo8qTi.c5qhUUCVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/wwd_409/72d931b8b3cca662c40f3585fe40e97a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660788", "eventUri": "eng-9660788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Florals have been ditched for the 2024 event in favour of frills, with fashion-forward attendees also opting for statement block colour designs.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, several women chose to wear elegant white dresses and jumpsuits, with Queen Camilla also sporting a white wrap dress. Other women elevated their outfits with elaborate headpieces and extravagant hats, with wild designs including wacky animal creations and flower ensembles.\n\nOne woman had a replica owl, with its wings spread, as a hat, while another wore a wide-brimmed lattice design she peered through. One woman stunned eventgoers with a huge red rose hat, while another attendee had a collection of children's toys on a faux grassy bank as headwear.\n\nGemma Mattison, 41, from Birmingham wore a large red rose as a hat and said she wanted to make a statement on Ladies' Day. She said: \"I always have a classic look when I come to Royal Ascot but this time I thought I'd go all out - it's now or never. So I've come as an English rose.\"\n\nMilliner Vivienne Jenner was wearing the large-brimmed lattice hat she designed and made: \"It's very lightweight as its made from wire work and the flowers are made of feathers, so it's very easy to wear.\" She joked: \"I can just bash everyone out of the way.\"\n\nIn its 313-year history, for the first time this year, Ascot announced the appointment of a creative director. British fashion designer Daniel Fletcher was responsible for the creation of the annual Lookbook and Millinery Collective in 2024, which has clearly set the tone and inspiration for this year's guests' outfits.\n\nThe women have been joined by the King and Queen this afternoon, who will be presenting trophies to the winners in the feature race of the week, the Gold Cup. Charles and Camilla, who took on Queen Elizabeth II's racing horses, have a thoroughbred entered in the King George V Stakes and will be hoping for their first Royal Ascot win of 2024.\n\nCelebrities are also in attendance, with some presenting prizes including actress Celia Imrie, Blackadder star Tim McInnerny and property expert and TV presenter Sarah Beeny.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saffron_otter@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Saffron Otter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ascot Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rose_of_Lancaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Rose of Lancaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jumpsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hatmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headgear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headgear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Owl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_George_V_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King George V Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celia_Imrie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celia Imrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_McInnerny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim McInnerny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Beeny", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Beeny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Gold_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ascot Gold Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackadder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blackadder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Casual", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Women's", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Women's", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Fashion", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33073952.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MAIN-Ascot2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660788", "eventUri": "eng-9660788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

The best part was seeing a healthy King Charles and a happy Lady Gabriella Windsor. - Rebekah Absalom - Internewscast Journal", "body": "The grand opening of Royal Ascot was a truly heartwarming experience.\n\nArriving at the Berkshire racecourse for the first time, I immediately made my way to the parade ring to secure a front-row view of the famous carriage procession.\n\nDating back to 1711, the event has featured the procession since 1825, when King George IV led four coaches up the Straight Mile.\n\nSurrounded by fellow royal enthusiasts, I eagerly awaited the two o'clock royal appearance, promptly followed by the Queen Anne Stakes, the first race of the day.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla were the first to arrive, accompanied by their close friends, the Duke and Duchess of Wellington.\n\nThere was some uncertainty regarding Charles's attendance due to ongoing cancer treatment, but it was encouraging see him looking well and waving to the jubilant crowd.\n\nCamilla appeared radiant in a cobalt coat dress designed by her go-to couturier, Fiona Clare, adorned with Prince Albert's Diamond and Sapphire Brooch.\n\nShe expertly accessorised with a Philip Treacy hat, her reliable Eliot Zed shoes and a Smythson clutch.\n\nAlthough I had previously seen the royal couple at Sandringham Flower Show in 2022, there was something profoundly moving about witnessing them in person, especially considering Charles's ongoing cancer treatment.\n\nI felt a deeply emotional sense of respect for the King and Queen - and, judging by the reactions of those around me, it seemed I was not alone in experiencing this.\n\nAs the second carriage approached, I was pleasantly surprised to see Lady Gabriella Windsor seated beside Princess Anne.\n\nOn the opposite side were Anne's son, Peter Phillips, and John Warren, the late Queen Elizabeth's racing manager, who now oversees the King's horses.\n\nLady Gabriella, displaying resilience after the tragic loss of her husband Thomas Kingston in February, was making a second appearance in a matter of days after her outing at Trooping the Colour at the weekend.\n\nIt was heartwarming to see the support she received from other royals, including a bear hug from Zara Phillips.\n\nThe royal stunned in a floral Catherine Walker dress, complemented by a Philip Treacy hat, Bottega Veneta clutch and Jimmy Choo pumps.\n\nIndeed, it was the impeccable attire of the royals that set the tone for the day.\n\nThousands of other racegoers showcased colourful ensembles and exquisite headwear - often from LK Bennett, one of Royal Ascot's official sponsors.\n\nThe high street brand has created a capsule collection of clothing, shoes and accessories for of the four enclosures, whether it be the prestigious Royal Enclosure or the more relaxed Windsor Enclosure.\n\nIn March, Ascot unveiled its annual lookbook under the artistic direction of British fashion designer, Daniel Fletcher, offering visitors plenty of style inspiration.\n\nThis marked a significant and historic change for the British racing institution as it appointed a creative director for the first time in its 300-year history.\n\nHaving recently interviewed milliner Jess Collett, responsible for the exquisite coronation headpieces worn by the Princess of Wales and Princess Charlotte, I was thrilled to wear her 'Cavendish' hat on day one of Royal Ascot.\n\nIt paired perfectly with a vintage-inspired polka dot dress from Beulah and an Aspinal of London bag.\n\nI completed my outfit with mid-heeled sandals from LK Bennett's coveted collection, saving a pink floral dress with statement puff sleeves for later in the week.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband sported his favourite Roderick Charles herringbone suit, with a complementary Moss waistcoat, Liberty tie and Loake loafers.\n\nWe savored the ambiance - a blend of attendees placing bets and enthusiastically cheering for their chosen horses, while others sat back and indulged in the plentiful food and drink options.\n\nThe four enclosures house various eateries and bars, ranging from gourmet fine dining to food stalls on the green.\n\nThere are also expansive picnic lawns for guests to enjoy their own food, if the weather permits, though it must be kept in a cool bag or hamper.\n\nWe noticed that Mo\u00ebt & Chandon champagne, another sponsor, was readily available, tempting us to have a glass or two.\n\nFollowing the final race - the Copper Horse Handicap, brilliantly won by Belloccio (William Buick) - the day concluded with traditional singing around the Bandstand.\n\nHundreds of revelers joined in, singing along to a medley of hits, including 'Angel's by Robbie Williams and Frank Sinatra's 'I Love You Baby'.\n\nIt created a fantastic atmosphere, ensuring the day ended on a high note, regardless of race outcomes.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [],

lace dress and a fanciful hat at...", "body": "Elizabeth Hurley might be known for her sultry swimwear, but she covered up in a look fit for the royal family as she rocked an elegant white lace dress at day two of Royal Ascot 2024 on Wednesday.\n\nThe \"Austin Powers\" star, 59, wore a fitted long-sleeved Monique Lhuillier dress ($4,995) covered in colorful floral embroidery as she entered the racecourse in Ascot, England on the arm of her longtime friend, Henry Birtles.\n\nThe midi-length style, which wouldn't have looked out of place on Kate Middleton, featured a scalloped neckline and 3D floral embellishments.\n\nThe swimwear entrepreneur added a bird's nest-style headpiece to the look, wearing a white tulle hat surrounded by tan basketweave trim.\n\nHurley -- who recently stripped down to her underwear for a Dior shoot -- hob-nobbed with the likes of Queen Camilla during her day at Ascot, with the yellow name badge on her chest denoting the actress as a guest in the racecourse's royal enclosure.\n\nShe pinned a similar badge on her sparkly blush purse and wore matching heels, finishing off her outfit with pearl drop earrings and a pair of aviator sunglasses.\n\nThe last time Hurley attended Royal Ascot was in 2016, when she presented the Queen Anne Stakes Trophy while wearing a sleek white shift dress and matching jacket.\n\nRoyal Ascot is a regular fixture in the British social diary each year, with Queen Camilla, Prince William and Princess Eugenie and her husband, Jack Brooksbank, arriving by carriage at Wednesday's event.\n\nAs for her own regal connections, the \"Royals\" actress recently opened up about the rumors she took Prince Harry's virginity, telling Andy Cohen that the theories were \"absurd\" on \"Watch What Happens

A firm fixture in the racing calendar, Royal Ascot takes place every year in the Berkshire town, attracting thousands of guests including celebrities and royals alike.\n\nDespite the congestion and chaos in the runup to the event, which starts today, delighted residents have found themselves earning thousands from either renting out their parking spaces or selling items to punters. One man claimed his neighbour made \u00a34k last year by simply selling flip-flops and water, while another offered up his driveway for \u00a330 a day.\n\nHowever some fuming neighbours have caught revellers using their front lawns as a toilet. Tim, who lives next to the racecourse entrance, highlighted the money-making opportunities Royal Ascot brings. \"Our next-door neighbours earnt \u00a34,000 last year by selling flip-flops and water out the front door,\" the 62-year-old said.\n\n\"Not bad for a week's work if you ask me. I've thought about making some money myself and I considered renting the house out before. When I got quoted, it was a fantastic amount of money. But I don't want it getting wrecked.\"\n\nWhile he often enjoys attending the races - using the complimentary ticket he receives for living so close by - he admitted he sometimes opts to go on holiday during race week as it can get too \"hectic\". Not only that, but he has seen drunk people use his garden to urinate, and also lost a deck chair or two over the years.\n\nHe admitted: \"It's fun when we go to the races but if we're not attending, we often go on holiday during this week. It's hectic and you do get the things people hear about - like drunk people coming into the garden to try take a p*ss. It's definitely worse on Ladies' Day. You also have to be careful about what you leave outside as one year our garden deck chairs got stolen.\n\n\"But it's only one week a year and it makes so much money for the area. I understand that it's good for people's jobs. And, I have to say, the security and organisation has been so much better in recent years.\"\n\nJon Grimes, who lives just a stone's throw from the racecourse, is a huge fan of Royal Ascot and has also profited from the occasion. \"I absolutely love it. It's wonderful. It's one of the reasons you live here, right?\" the 52-year-old said. \"It's been going on since 1711 - so it was here well before us. I don't think you can move here and complain about it as you know what you're going to get.\n\n\"We go every year as we love the atmosphere and people are always in good moods. It's great fun. It's very well organised too. Ascot do a great job of managing the roads and cleaning things up.\" The dad says the community often get involved in any way they can - with his children previously making pocket money by selling refreshments from their front garden.\n\n\"People around here get involved - our kids used to sell lemonade and brownies out the front of the house so they'd make some good pocket money,\" he said. \"They're a bit too old to have the 'cute' factor to do that now but it was fun when they did and I know others do similar things.\"\n\nBrian Greatorex, 68, has had a few issues with the races over the years - such as his fence being damaged by the masses of coaches who pass down his road. He said: \"The coaches which bring loads of people in go by our house so we've had some whacking into our fence.\n\n\"It can be a bit of a pain as you get sent around the houses when you're trying to get it fixed. We also do get the odd person who comes along and uses the driveway as a toilet - but people along the road are quite good at dealing with it.\n\n\"Our neighbour came over and sprayed a man with a hose, which I thought was brilliant. Good on her. But in general - it's one week a year - and we enjoy going to the races. So you do get used to it.\"\n\nLike Mr Grimes' kids and Tim's neighbours, Mr Greatorex has also made his own money from the week when he can - by hiring out car parking spaces in his driveway. He said: \"The official car parks cost \u00a345 - so if you offer your driveway for \u00a330... We've had five cars a day in here before so you can make good money. Bookies are regular customers.\"\n\nSiechlinbe, 72, has also had people in her driveway - but for a different reason. \"We've had people stumbling down our driveway asking to use our phone or sometimes our toilet,\" she admitted with a laugh. \"One year, we had a drunk young girl asking to use the phone as she had lost her boyfriend - so we helped her. It's nice to help.\n\n\"It's true that it's a little hectic but things are generally very well organised. They always pick up all the rubbish and the coaches generally get out of here by 9pm. And while it's going on, the atmosphere is good.\"\n\nRoyal Ascot week also proved popular with local businesses who welcomed the boost in customers. Olga Klocek, assistant manager at Fego Cafe on Ascot High Street, said: \"We're very busy during the races which is good for business.\n\n\"People come in and get breakfast or brunch before they start the day. We make sure we get more staff in - and we shorten the menu so it's easier for the chefs. But we do add a few cocktails to the menu as that's a bit of fun.\"\n\nFortunately, Olga and her team have generally had good experiences with customers - despite stories of rowdy and drunken behaviour. She said: \"We don't really see the really drunk people as we're more a morning than an evening place. In my experience, the customers have always been very nice.\n\n\"It's actually a fun day. You feel stressed the day before trying to get everything ready but on the day it's exciting. Work goes quicker when you're busy.\" There are some shops on the high street which choose to shut during race week as their regular customers can't make it in due to road closures.\n\nHowever, Raji Gill, owner of Buds & Blooms, is feeling positive about the week ahead and has decided to keep her doors open. The 39-year-old florist said: \"It's our first year here and so we're excited to see what things are like.\n\n\"I know that a lot of the stores along this street close for the week - but we thought it would be a good way to introduce ourselves to people. We've made a horse sculpture out of moss and we've got flowers out the front so we thought people might enjoy taking pictures.\n\n\"Especially all the ladies in their lovely dresses. We've heard from other local businesses that the atmosphere is really good. So we're looking forward to the buzz.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saffron_otter@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Saffron Otter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "imogen_howse@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Imogen Howse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ascot Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driveway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Driveway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flops", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flip-flops"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_division_of_Greatorex", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral division of Greatorex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_brownie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chocolate brownie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lemonade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parking lot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sculpture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33055201.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_We-live-in-Ascot-we-can-make-thousands-selling-parking-drinks-and-flip-flops.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660788", "eventUri": "eng-9660788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

She was there to attend the second day of this year's Royal Ascot, a celebration described by event organizers as being \"reserved for the best; the best in racing, the best in hospitality - and, of course, the best in style.\"\n\nHurley, 59, dazzled in her white dress, which featured a white liner beneath the white lace that fell elegantly from her neck to her ankles. The dress featured lace sleeves and was adorned with four delicate flower designs that were attached to the lace between Hurley's neck and hips.\n\nThe model paired her dress with a small handbag that matched her heels, dark sunglasses and a beige and white hat. She flashed a huge smile at photographers as she arrived, dressed to impress for the event.\n\nThis year's Royal Ascot officially began on June 18 and runs through June 22. The late Queen Elizabeth II used to enjoy attending the equestrian event with members of her extended family. Several people within and linked to the royal family continued in that tradition this week, with Prince William and his in-laws, Carole and Michael Middleton, among those in attendance.\n\nBefore her arrival at the Royal Ascot, Hurley attended several red carpet events earlier this year in support of her new movie, Strictly Confidential. The thriller, which was released in April, served as the first feature-length film directed by her lookalike son, Damian Hurley. The 22-year-old joined his mother often at special events supporting the film's theatrical release over the last several months.\n\nNext: Elizabeth Hurley Was 'Born to Wear a Bikini' in New Photos From Paradise", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meghan_roos@postandcourier.com", "name": "Meghan Roos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ascot Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot,_Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ascot, Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ascot, Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bikini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damian Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feature film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleton,_Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middleton, Greater Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Middleton, Greater Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Swimwear", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Swimwear", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Formal_Wear", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Formal Wear", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/6a/d6a93855-114d-56c2-827a-4839bf65bdac/6674b262a1e46.image.jpg?crop=1182%2C621%2C0%2C89&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660788", "eventUri": "eng-9660788", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 24, "textEnd": 31, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1335, "textEnd": 1342}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 1360, "textEnd": 1367}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 196, "textEnd": 203}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

With a smart collar, full-length skirt and all-over wildflower motifs, the wife of Prince Edward stood out amongst the raceday revellers in her ultra-flattering ensemble.\n\nFor those in the prestigious royal enclosure, the strict sartorial rules require all guests to don their most marvellous millinery. \"Hats must be worn. However, a headpiece or hatinator with a minimum base diameter of 4 inches/10cm is acceptable,\" is the advice on the official website.\n\nThe mother-of-two adhered to Royal Ascot's strict dress code with the addition of a mauve hat crafted by Jane Taylor millinery, while also carrying a fuschia clutch bag from Sophie Habsburg.\n\nAmongst her new finery, the Duchess appeared to wear a pair of vintage pointed-toe mules believed to have been in her wardrobe for more than a decade, per Remoulade Sauce on X.\n\nRoyal Ascot is considered to be the most glamorous occasion in the royal family's calendar. The Duchess of Edinburgh made an entrance onto the world-famous racecourse via a horse-drawn carriage, sharing her moment in the spotlight with her husband Prince Edward, the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nSophie and Edward's daughter Lady Louise Windsor, 20, is yet to make her Royal Ascot debut. After her head-turning appearance at Trooping the Colour, many royal fans wondered if the young royal, who is currently studying at St Andrews university, would finally join her family members at the prestigious race day.\n\nGrant Harrold, former butler to King Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry, recently revealed on Lord Ping's podcast that Ascot was considered to be the \"Christmas\" of the royal's social agenda.\n\n\"The King definitely enjoys the horse racing and he attends all of the different events and we've seen him at lots of meetings. I still think the late Queen was more into that part of what she did, she loved horses,\" added Grant.\n\n\"The King does as well, but it's slightly less. I don't think we'll see The King jumping up and down and running around the royal box when they have a winner, so it's slightly different.\"", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ascot Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie,_Duchess_of_Edinburgh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hatmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enclosure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Habsburg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophie Habsburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handbag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Handbag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Harrold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Harrold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Louise_Windsor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Louise Windsor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooping_the_Colour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trooping the Colour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Philip,_Duke_of_Edinburgh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical_Personages", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historical Personages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land Forces", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/4408140551b5-duchess-sophie-ascot.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660788", "eventUri": "eng-9660788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

The cherry on top of Camilla's outfit was nonetheless her matching wide-brimmed blue hat designed by beloved royal milliner, Philip Treacy.\n\nAscot is renowned for its strict dress code! Outfits above the knee and strapless dresses are a big no-no, while hats and fascinators are a staple.\n\nAlthough Camilla's hat was a fabulous addition to her outfit, it hilariously got in the way as she greeted royal relatives including Zara and Mike Tindall.\n\nAs former rugby player Mike, 45, warmly lent in for a kiss, he narrowly avoided a faux pas by tilting his head to the side so as to avoid Camilla's wide-brimmed hat.\n\nPrincess Anne's daughter was also photographed greeting Queen Camilla, with the pair deftly dipping their heads as they shared an embrace.\n\nDressed to impress, Zara, 43, struck sartorial gold in a lemon yellow 'Masai' dress from Laura Green London.

King Charles and Queen Camilla were in attendance, because Charles is trying to rebrand himself as a late-in-life horse enthusiast. Zara and Mike Tindall were also there, because they turn up to practically every royal event and no one blinks an eye. Prince Eugenie was also there, but she was not included in the \"royal procession,\" where royals ride along in carriages and wave to the peasants.\n\nSomeone who was invited to the royal procession? Lady Gabriella Windsor. She was also invited to Trooping the Colour, but she did not step onto the balcony. So Ascot marks her first real public appearance since her husband's February death. Gabriella was invited to ride in a carriage with Princess Anne and Peter Phillips. Gabriella looked okay, all things considered. She's lost a noticeable amount of weight but she made the effort to show up and smile. Hr vibe was \"I'm ready to get out of the house for a few hours.\"\n\nThe Court Jeweller had some interesting details about Camilla and Charles's Ascot bling. Charles wore an antique tie pin bearing the royal cypher of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria. Which is just weird, right? Meanwhile, Camilla dusted off her new favorite sapphire piece, the absolutely enormous Prince Albert's Brooch, an extraordinary diamond-and-sapphire piece given to Queen Victoria by Prince Albert the night before their wedding. Camilla has worn the piece twice before. It was also a favorite of QEII. Camilla also grabbed a pair of QEII's earrings with sapphires, diamonds, rubies and pearl drops. Camilla's blue ensemble was done by dressmaker Fiona Clare, in her favorite \"zippered housedress\" style.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ascot Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gabriella_Kingston", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gabriella Kingston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tindall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tindall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward VII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooping_the_Colour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trooping the Colour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anne, Princess Royal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_cypher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal cypher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_III_of_Bulgaria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boris III of Bulgaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sapphire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert,_Prince_Consort", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albert, Prince Consort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pearl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations_and_Announcements", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations and Announcements", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Diamonds", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Diamonds", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Carriage,_Hay,_and_Sleigh_Rides", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Carriage, Hay, and Sleigh Rides", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660788", "eventUri": "eng-9660788", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 65, "textEnd": 74}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

And there are certainly some bold shades that might even get the horses' attention.\n\nWhile muted navy's and floral prints have always been popular, Giorgio thinks Cherry Red and Liquid Gold are the big winners of this year.\n\nThe fashion guru shared: \"Spring Summer 24 collections' hottest colours are Cherry Red (Gucci, Chanel), white (Valentino, Saint Laurent, Chloe') Blue (Bottega Veneta, JW Anderson, Ganni), Liquid Gold (Ralph Lauren, Alberta Ferretti, Jimmy Choo), Lilac (Margela, Tom Ford).\n\n\"Both in garments and accessories.\"\n\nHowever, Giorgio does have a bit of a controversial on one opinion when it comes to the colour of your dress. Many fashion gurus think that white is a big no-no when it comes to Royal Ascot.\n\nDespite him encouraging the dress of bright wear, Giorgio thinks that white is the \"safest\" and can be the \"most popular\" because it's the easiest colour to match accessories with.\n\nWhile you won't have to worry about colour clashing, other fashion experts might turn their noses up.\n\nBut, as fashion progresses, so do opinions.\n\nAnd Giorgio is fully behind the white dresses of Ascot this year.\n\nHe continued: \"They are safe colours and easy to wear, even for the more traditional souls.\n\n\"Among these colours, I would say that white can be the safest and most popular of all because it's easy for everyone to wear and you can easily match any colourful accessories with it.\"\n\nSo now we've established some of the more intricate details to Royal Ascot dressing, let's take a look at Giorgio's quick fire do's and don'ts for the classy event at the races:\n\nDo's Dresses and skirts: just above the knee or slightly below the knee Suits: women's suits are allowed. They must be full length with trousers reaching the ankle Hats: they are a must-have accessory for any Ascot event. They are a traditional part of the look, and they should be worn Fabrics: choose fabrics that offer a more sophisticated look such as silk, viscose, and chiffon Colours: solid colours are preferable Don'ts No dresses off the shoulder, or strapless, or thin straps. They are not allowed by the dress code. The strap should measure 1 inch or bigger No excessively form-fitting/ clingy silhouettes No garments with crazy prints/colors. Keep it modest.

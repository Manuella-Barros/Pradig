During May 29's episode of the New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce podcast, the former Philadelphia Eagles player, 36, revealed what they got up to for the U.S. holiday. \"We went to Sea Isle [New Jersey]. We definitely went to Sea Isle. Went to the beach, had a lot of fun with the girls, ate a bunch of beach food,\" Jason said. The retired NFL star shares daughters Wyatt Elizabeth, 4, Elliotte Ray, 3, and 15-month-old Bennett Llewellyn with his wife Kylie Kelce. \"We had a great time,\" Jason added, as his brother Travis Kelce, 34, responded, \"There we go. Alright. Nice, man. Glad you guys got over to the shore, man. I miss the shore.\" \"Shore is fun. It was good to be out there. It's the first really big weekend of the year. So all the businesses are back up and running. So, yep, it's like you never left,\" Jason added. Travis pointed out he'd heard the family had visited Uncle Bill's Pancake House over the weekend, telling his brother, \"Listen, I got eyes everywhere, baby.\" The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Jason is all about spending time with his family, and his wife Kylie, 32, recently said that while his girls might be too young to remember his long career with the Philadelphia Eagles, she hopes they'll understand how important he was to the city. \"I think that ultimately, it\u2019s not about them remembering that he played football, it\u2019s all the lessons that he got from football that he then gets to take with him,\" Kylie said on the Today show last month. \"But I hope that ultimately they end up understanding that their dad had an impact on Philadelphia in a way that was wholesome and that he understood the city, enough that he wanted to stay there and raise a family there,\" she continued. \"He gave his blood, sweat and tears to the city and it was out of sheer love and commitment. And I hope that my girls see that,\u201d Kylie added.", "summary": "&#34;We had a great time,&#34; the retired NFL player said of having quality family time with his wife Kylie and their three daughters in Sea Isle City", "url": "https://people.com/jason-kelce-wife-kylie-daughters-memorial-day-weekend-sea-isle-city-8655050", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/Fhx9GGGk-4Isn9cSluhni5Zw4S8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(735x228:737x230)/jason-kelce-kylie-052924-1-d06f8725edc6442b8527d66fdfbfc013.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:29:10", "author": "Becca Longmire", "authors": ["Becca Longmire"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.518}

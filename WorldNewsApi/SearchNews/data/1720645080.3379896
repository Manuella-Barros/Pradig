The veteran Hearts goalkeeper was informed by head coach Steve Clarke that he won\u2019t be going on the plane to Germany on Sunday, with Angus Gunn, Gordon\u2019s Tynecastle teammate Zander Clark and Liam Kelly selected as his three stoppers for the tournament. Gordon was named on the bench for Friday night's 2-2 friendly draw with Finland at Hampden Park, but received a great reception as he made a substitute appearance which saw him become the oldest player to feature for the national team at the age of 41, overtaking David Weir. His farewell cameo was ruined after the Scots let a two-goal lead slip through their fingers at the national stadium as Benjamin Kallman\u2019s header and Oliver Antman late spot-kick earned the Scandinavians a share of the spoils. Clarke\u2019s squad were still given a special send off by the Tartan Army, but Gordon was cut from the provisional squad along with Rangers defender John Souttar after the game. And while struggling to hide his devastation at missing out on the trip to Germany, he attempted to put things in perspective just over 18 months after suffering a horror double leg break. He outlined the four targets he set himself in an emotional statement. He posted on Instagram: \u201cWhen I was in the initial stages of my recovery I set myself four goals. The first was to be out of pain. The seriousness of the break made for complications and further procedures. I went through a lot of pain and wanted to be able to live life without it. I did that.

We\u2019ve done that. Many, many times and they won\u2019t let me stop now. \u201cThe third goal I had was to play for Hearts again. This meant a lot to me. I did that competitively in January, having played my first friendly in November, 10 months after I broke my leg. It was a long wait, but I was ready to play the rest of the season. \u201cThe last thing I hoped to do was to make the Scotland squad again. And to put myself in a position to be at the Euros. Coming into the provisional squad I knew I hadn\u2019t got the games I needed so I trained harder, I trained well and felt, and still feel, very good. I am of course, so disappointed not to be there. \u201cPlaying again for Scotland last night meant I did what I set out to do. And while it wasn\u2019t in the way I wanted, I could never turn down the opportunity to play at Hampden again. Something I have had the honour of doing for over 20 years. The circumstances were tough, it was an extremely emotional night for my family and I. But I\u2019m grateful I got that opportunity. To become the oldest player to play for Scotland, it\u2019s a special record. \u201cGiven how long I\u2019ve been doing this, I\u2019ve experienced so much and I, probably more than others, know all too well, that things don\u2019t always go your way. Decisions go against you. Last night, of all nights, I wished they didn\u2019t but if a nervous 21 year old could have seen that so many years on, through some big challenges, I\u2019d be there at 41 years old, I think I\u2019d be very happy with that. \u201cI should have been given a smaller shirt on my debut(!), but I knew that if I played for the badge on the front, people would remember the name on the back. I hope I\u2019ve done that, and will continue to do so for as long as I feel good enough. 75 caps.

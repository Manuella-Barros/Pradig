This week, we hear from a reader who\u2019s struggling to make a decision between her husband of eight years and a married man she\u2019s been having an affair with. After being caught out by her husband and threatening divorce, she\u2019s now returned home and promised to give the relationship another go. But her lover isn\u2019t ready to let go, despite refusing to leave his wife. Can she keep both men on the go? Read the advice below, but before you go, don\u2019t forget to check out last week\u2019s dilemma, from a 37-year-old whose ex-partner is calling her a \u2018pervert\u2019 because she\u2019s dating a much younger man. The problem\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m in an impossible position and can\u2019t see a way out. Basically, my husband and lover both want to be with me and neither will give me up. I\u2019m 32 and have been married for eight years. When my marriage was going through a bad patch last year, I started looking at other guys online, and it wasn\u2019t long before I got talking to someone. We discovered that we were both unhappy with our partners, and began meeting up in secret. This guy was not a disappointment, and the feelings I have for him are stronger than those I have for my husband. Unfortunately, my other half sensed there was something wrong and snatched my phone when I was texting a friend. Once he had access to my unlocked phone, he soon discovered my affair. We had the most almighty row, which ended with me throwing my wedding ring at him and telling him I wanted a divorce. I spent the next few nights with a girlfriend, but when I told my lover what had happened, he said he couldn\u2019t leave his wife as they have children and he would be financially screwed. My husband begged me to come back, and as I didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go, I returned with the promise of trying again. That\u2019s all very well to say, but my lover doesn\u2019t want to give me up either. So I have two men, both begging me to stay with them. I feel that both these guys are only thinking of themselves, but what about me? The advice\u2026 You seem to be playing the helpless victim in this drama, whereas in fact you are the lead character and need to think about your own behaviour, not theirs. Going back to your husband because you had nowhere else to go is deeply unfair on him. If you feel the marriage is definitely over, you need to make plans to stay elsewhere, even if it\u2019s difficult. But bear in mind what your lover said. If he has no intention of ever leaving his family, you\u2019ll spend the rest of the relationship being the \u2018other woman\u2019 which rarely leads to happiness. Think again about your marriage; with the help of a counsellor, you might be able to work things out. But if you really can\u2019t stand it, the sooner you see a solicitor and end things properly, the better. At least you won\u2019t be in the limbo state you\u2019re in now, and once you and your husband know exactly where you stand, you can start to move forward. Perhaps deep down you\u2019re enjoying the drama and the idea of two men fighting over you, but there are other people involved. Your lover\u2019s children deserve to have a dad who focuses on his family, not on you. My advice is to step back and let him sort out his problems at home. Only when (and if) you are both free, should you consider resuming your relationship. Laura is a counsellor and columnist. Got a sex and dating dilemma?

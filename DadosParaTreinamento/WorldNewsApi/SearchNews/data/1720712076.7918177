Now she\u2019s been credited with saving other children\u2019s lives", "text": "She has worked tirelessly to help prevent other children dying from swallowing button batteries. But for Allison Burns, her daughter, Bella, has always been front of mind, and in her heart. Since Burns\u2019 14-month-old girl died slowly and painfully after ingesting a button battery in February 2015, Burns has not just hoped for change, she has acted. Lobbying by the charity she set up, Bella\u2019s Footprints, has led to tighter regulations on the batteries\u2019 sale and storage to be adopted in Australia and the United States, with the UK set to follow. Burns, who lives in Taylors Hill in Melbourne\u2019s north-west, is one of the community heroes in the 2024 King\u2019s Birthday honours list.", "summary": "Allison Burns receives the OAM for her work helping to prevent children dying from ingesting button batteries, as happened to her daughter, Bella.", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/allison-s-baby-died-after-swallowing-a-battery-now-she-s-been-credited-with-saving-other-children-s-lives-20240605-p5jjjd.html", "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.29909412285607756%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_73/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/e7ee571cef7526d8e57bc69f97dda689aa2a3dc2", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:00:00", "author": "Carolyn Webb", "authors": ["Carolyn Webb"], "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": 0.084}

The company has called back 462,869 Telluride SUVs between the model year 2020-2024 vehicles due to risks. Kia has also issued a safety warning for its customers - advising them to park their vehicle outside in case their seat spontaneously catches fire According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the front power seat motor susceptible to overheating due to a stuck power seat slide knob - which may ignite a flame. Kia also told car owners that the quickest way to identify if their vehicle is at risk is if passengers cannot adjust their seat, they smell burning under a seat or if they see visible smoke. The federal agency also clarified that once the cars have been returned, dealers will be installing a bracket for the power seat switch back covers and replace the seat slide knobs for no additional cost. Owners whose vehicles are at risk will be notified by by mail starting July 30. The recall comes after multiple complaints about burning smell from the seats, slide knob found stuck in the upward position, dislodged seat switch back cover and knob damage were lodged with dealers. Most notably, a 2023MY Telluride owner complained to their dealer that their driver seat caught on fire while driving in March 2024. The dealer registered the incident with the company and sent them pictures - later revealing that the fire emerged from the driver's side seat tilt motor. But this is not Kia's first recall for the Telluride SUVs. The manufacturer called back about 400,000 SUVs in America to fix a problem that can let the vehicles roll away when in park in March this year. The recall, submitted to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on March 20, involves various Telluride models. Some 427,407 Telluride vehicles with model years 2020-2024 are affected. All those from the 2020-2023 model year manufactured from January 9, 2019, through October 19, 2023 have been recalled. And certain 2024 model year Tellurides produced from January 9, 2019, through October 19, 2023 have the problem too. Kia's recall says problems with the driveshaft - due to suspected improper assembly - is to blame. This can lead to 'unintended vehicle movement while in park if the parking brake is not engaged.' This results in 'unintended vehicle movement increases the risk of a crash.' But the problem can be fixed with a software update, which makes the driveshaft engage properly. Affected Telluride owners should take their cars to a Kia dealer for the update.", "summary": "Car manufacturer Kia has issued an urgent recall for 462,869 Telluride SUVs between the model year 2020-2024 after warnings emerged of power seats in the vehicles potentially catching fire", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13508963/kia-telluride-recall-nhtsa-warns-fire-risk.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/08/17/85877211-0-image-a-9_1717863499210.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:31:25", "author": "Editor,Ishita Srivastava", "authors": ["Editor", "Ishita Srivastava"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.745}

We are not desperate to have it (a deal) done or not.\n\n\"He wants more football at the highest level so we are having conversations and discussing the possibility of him staying for the second part of the season.\"\n\nUnited kick off their Premier League campaign at home to West Ham on Sunday, having won six of their seven pre-season friendlies.\n\nThe signings of defender Victor Lindelof from Benfica, midfielder Nemanja Matic from Chelsea and striker Romelu Lukaku from Everton have also lifted the mood.\n\nDefeat by Real Madrid in Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup match in Skopje was a setback, but Mourinho says his team are ready for the new season.\n\n\"We have added three players, one defender, one midfielder and one attacking player,\" the Portuguese boss explained.\n\n\"But we have lost important players to injury too, such as Marcos Rojo, Ashley Young, Luke Shaw, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\n\n\"Between the players we have lost and the players we have got, I think we are in a similar situation but with more experience of working together and a much better pre-season.\n\n\"We have the confidence levels of a team who won a European competition. Our levels of confidence and knowledge are higher so I am happy to start the season. I think we are ready.\"\n\nMourinho has indicated that he wants a fourth signing before the transfer window shuts on August 31, as he needs a winger to bolster his squad.\n\n\"In my initial analysis, coming from January and through the other months, I was thinking about four players.\n\n\"I am not a difficult person to work with, and I understand the reality of the market. I understand by doing 75 percent of what I asked, the club did very well.\n\n\"I don't think I am in a position to be moaning and crying. I'm happy with the effort the club did and I'm happy they managed to do 75 percent of the work before the Premier League starts.\"\n\nHe added: \"If the remaining 25 percent doesn't arrive by August 31, I will not moan.

It's not something that's urgent, it's not desperate to have it done or not.\n\n\"It was very clear by showing what he did last year was not enough for him. He wants more football at the highest level so we are having conversations and discussing the possibility of him staying for the second part of the season.\"\n\nThe return of Ibrahimovic in mid-season would boost United's attacking options at a time when the club are struggling to add the fourth signing Mourinho craves before the close of the transfer window on Aug. 31.\n\nUnited have spent \u00a3146 million on Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof but Mourinho still wants a wide player. He would ideally like to sign Gareth Bale but any hopes of acquiring the Wales forward appears to hinge on Real Madrid buying Kylian Mbappe while United have balked at Inter Milan's \u00a349 million asking price for Ivan Perisic. Full-backs Danny Rose and Serge Aurier have also been linked with United.\n\nBut Mourinho says he will not \"moan or cry\" if United fail to add a fourth signing. \"I understand the reality of the market, of the numbers and that my club, by doing 75 per cent of what I initially asked, did very well,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think I am in a position of moaning, crying, contesting or to say I am not happy with it. I am happy with the effort the club did and that the club managed to do 75 per cent of the work before the Premier League starts.\n\n\"Until August 31, if the remaining 25 per cent doesn't arrive, I will not moan. I will just go with everything I have to try to win every match we play.\n\n\"My initial analysis from January and progressing through other months I was thinking of four players but I am not a difficult person to work with, even if looks different or you want to make it look so.\n\n\"Twenty-five per cent means one of four. We got a central defender who can play many other positions which is very important. Victor can play right-back and centre midfield.\n\n\"We have a central midfield and striker, so obviously another player would be one coming from the sides. But we have players and if we cannot strengthen then we have people we trust.\n\n\"We added three players: one defender, one midfielder and one attacker. But for the beginning of the season, we lost some important ones too: [Marcos] Rojo, [Ashley] Young, [Luke] Shaw, Zlatan, players with injuries.\n\n\"So between what we have lost and what we have got, we're in a similar situation. We have more experience of working together with a much better pre-season than last season with confidence levels of a team that won a European competition.\n\n\"We are back in the Champions League so the motivation and confidence levels are higher, and the knowledge between ourselves is higher.\n\n\"The Premier League is what you all know. I'd say seven teams to fight for the title and 20 to fight for the victory every game, every match. That's the difference from the three other leagues I have worked in. Every opponent wants to win every match. Every opponent gives you a hard time.\"", "timeCrawl": "15:16:00", "sim": 0.7960784435272217, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1457, "date": "2017-08-31", "textStart": 1450}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8646069", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "id": 99, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "id": 673, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "id": 822, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

I am happy with the effort the club did and that the club managed to do 75 per cent of the work before the Premier League starts.\n\n'Until August 31, if the remaining 25 per cent doesn't arrive, I will not moan. I will just go with everything I have to try to win every match we play.\n\n'My initial analysis from January and progressing through other months I was thinking of four players but I am not a difficult person to work with, even if looks different or you want to make it look so.\n\n'Twenty-five per cent means one of four. We got a central defender who can play many other positions which is very important. Victor can play right-back and centre midfield.\n\n'We have a central midfield and striker, so obviously another player would be one coming from the sides. But we have players and if we cannot strengthen then we have people we trust.'\n\nMourinho believes the loss of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Marcos Rojo, Luke Shaw and Ashley Young to injury means that United start the season in a 'similar situation' to the last one. But he insists that an ideal pre-season in America has left them in better shape to compete for the title.\n\nHe said: 'We added three players: one defender, one midfielder and one attacker. But for the beginning of the season, we lost some important ones too: Rojo, Young, Shaw, Zlatan, players with injuries.\n\n'So between what we have lost and what we have got, we're in a similar situation. We have more experience of working together with a much better pre-season than last season with confidence levels of a team that won a European competition.\n\n'We are back in the Champions League so the motivation and confidence levels are higher, and the knowledge between ourselves is higher.\n\n'I'm really happy to start this season because the pre-season was very complete and organised. We played MLS teams (La Galaxy and Real Salt Lake) and ended against the best teams in Europe (Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester City). I am really happy to start. I think we are ready.'\n\nMourinho believes that his players will be more motivated for the Champions League than the Europa League. Not playing on Thursday nights will also be a benefit as United look to improve their Premier League form after a disappointing sixth-place finish.\n\nAsked if his team can win the title, he replied: 'Yes we can. The Europa League not the Champions League. Obviously that's more difficult, but also the motivation is higher.\n\n'My hard work last season to face teams in the Europa League with commitment, responsibility was hard at that level. This season it will not hard to motivate versus Real Madrid, Barcelona, top English teams, Bayern Munich, Juventus.\n\n'The Premier League is what you all know. I'd say seven teams to fight for the title and 20 to fight for the victory every game, every match. That's the difference from the three other leagues I have worked in.

United have been linked with moves for Inter's Ivan Perisic and Real Madrid's Gareth Bale, as well as full-backs Danny Rose (Tottenham) and Serge Aurier (PSG).\n\nMourinho told a news conference on Friday: \"We have 25 percent left which means one of four -- we got a central defender that can play many other positions which is very important. Victor [Lindelof] can play right-back, centre midfield.\n\n\"We have a central midfielder and a striker, so obviously another player would be one coming from the sides, but we have players and if we cannot strengthen then we have people we trust.\"\n\nMourinho has spent \u00a3147 million to bring Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic and Lindelof to Old Trafford.\n\nThe Portuguese coach says he is happy with the window so far. And while he made no secret of his desire to see one more player come in, the 54-year-old is adamant it will not make or break United's season.\n\nAhead of the Premier League opener against West Ham at Old Trafford on Sunday, he said: \"My initial analysis from January and progressing through other months I was thinking of four players but I am not a difficult person to work with, even if looks different or you want to make it look so.\n\n\"I understand the reality of the market, of the numbers and that my club by doing 75 percent of what I initially asked did very well. I don't think I am in a position of moaning, crying, contesting or to say I am not happy with it.\n\n\"I am happy with the effort the club did and that the club managed to do 75 percent of the work before the Premier League starts and until Aug. 31. If the remaining 25 percent don't arrive I will not moan, just go with everything I have to try to win every match we play.\"\n\nMourinho won the title in his second season in both spells at Chelsea, as well as during his time at Real Madrid and Inter Milan. He believes he can do it again with United, but he accepts that the squad is \"similar\" to the one that fell 24 points short of champions Chelsea last season.\n\n\"We had three players as you know, one defender, one midfielder and one attacking player but for this beginning of the season we lost important players too, we lost [Marcos] Rojo, [Ashley] Young, [Luke] Shaw, Zlatan, we lost players for injuries so I think between the players we lost and we got we are in a similar situation,\" he said.\n\n\"With more experience of working together, of a much better preseason than we had last season, with the confidence levels of a team that won a European competition, is back in the Champions League, so motivations are higher and confidence levels so I would say I am really happy to start the Premier League this weekend because our preseason was very complete and was organised in a way where we start playing against MLS teams and we end it playing against the best teams in Europe, so I'm happy to start Sunday, we are ready.\"\n\nRob is ESPN FC's Manchester United correspondent.

I think it is the objective of every one of the top teams and every one of the top team managers,\" Mourinho said.\n\n\"I don't think I am going to win it because I always win it in the second season. Not at all.\n\n\"I just think that naturally, a manager in the second season knows the players and knows the club better.\n\n\"I don't say I know the league better because I have been in this league for a long time.\n\n\"We are in a position to do quality work better than we did in the first season, so I am convinced that our second season, in terms of the quality of our team, is going to be better.\n\n\"I have conditions to deliver a better team than I did in the first season. If that is going to mean better results and the title, I don't know.\"\n\nDisrupted\n\nMourinho's side begin their Premier League campaign at home to West Ham tomorrow having enjoyed a strong pre-season, winning six out of seven friendlies before losing to Real Madrid in the Uefa Super Cup on Tuesday.\n\nThat is a big change from a year ago, when United played only five pre-season matches after a friendly against Manchester City in Beijing was called off.\n\nThe arrivals of defender Victor Lindelof, midfielder Nemanja Matic and striker Romelu Lukaku have also improved the squad.\n\nHowever, Mourinho has lost a number of key players to long-term injury, including defenders Marcos Rojo and Luke Shaw, and wing-back Ashley Young.\n\nWhile Mourinho has welcomed the new signings, he argues that of greater significance is the fact his team will not have their domestic fixture list disrupted by the Europa League this season.\n\nWhile United had to deal with playing regularly on Thursdays and Sundays on their way to winning the competition in Stockholm, Chelsea eased to the Premier League title with no European football to worry about -- and neither did Liverpool, who took fourth spot as United finished sixth.\n\n\"I think everybody is in Europe. The top seven, we are all in Europe. Last season, two of them were not in Europe,\" Mourinho said.\n\n\"This time, we are all in the same basket. It is going to be the same for everybody.\n\n\"Arsenal and Everton are in the Europa League and they have to play Thursdays. But the top seven, we are going to be in the four competitions and so there is no advantage for any one of us.\" -- AFP", "timeCrawl": "00:42:00", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 127, "date": "2017-08-12", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 133}, {"date": "2015-02-", "textStart": 82, "amb": false, "textEnd": 93}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8725500", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

While Mourinho has all his new signings available, he is also without last season's top scorer, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is now out of contract following a serious knee injury.\n\nUnited finished sixth last season but did qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League. Asked about their ambitions, Mourinho said: \"Yes we can win [the Premier League]. The Champions League is obviously more difficult. But also the motivation is higher. My work last season to face teams in the Europa League with commitment was hard, this season it is not hard to motivate for playing Real Madrid, Barcelona, the top English teams, Bayern Munich and Juventus.\n\n\"In the Premier League I'd say seven teams will fight for the title and 20 fight for the victory in every game, every match. That's different to the three other leagues [Portugal, Italy and Spain] I have worked in.

AP\n\nMourinho goes into his second season at Old Trafford needing significant improvement in the Premier League after United finished sixth in May.\n\nHowever, the club did win the Europa League and the League Cup, giving the manager a platform of success on which to build.\n\nMourinho's optimism is based on three beliefs; he feels he has a more settled squad than when he arrived, that they have had a better pre-season than 12 months ago and that their rivals at the top of the division will have greater distractions in European competition this time.\n\n\"What would it mean for me to be the Premier League champion?

The top seven, we are all in Europe. Last season, two of them were not in Europe,\" Mourinho said.\n\n\"This time, we are all in the same basket.

So obviously there's no guarantee. Or do I think I'm going to win it because I always win in the second season? Not at all.\n\n\"I just think naturally that a manger in the second season knows the players better, knows the club better.\n\n\"I don't say the league, because I've been in this league for a long time. But we're in a position to do better quality work than we did in the first season.\n\n\"So I'm convinced I have - not just the hope - but the conviction that our second season, in terms of the quality of our team, is going to be better.\n\n\"I have the conditions to deliver a better team than I did in the first season. If that's going to mean better results and the title, I don't know.\"\n\nUnited finished sixth last term, 24 points behind champions Chelsea , but that picture was distorted with Mourinho having given up on the top four weeks before the end of the season to focus on winning the Europa League as a way back to the Champions League.\n\nBut this season he is determined to launch a sustained title assault. Mourinho has spent \u00a3146million this summer on Victor Lindelof , Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic , taking his total spend at United in 12 months close to \u00a3300m.\n\nThe United boss still wants one more signing before the August 31 transfer deadline, with Tottenham's versatile left-sided player Danny Rose having emerged as a genuine target.\n\nMourinho has been after a left-sided attacker all summer and Rose, ostensibly a full-back but who can operate as a wing-back, could ultimately end up filling that void at United.\n\nBut Mourinho conceded United, who host West Ham on Sunday, must improve on last season's woeful record at home, which saw them draw 10 league games at Old Trafford.\n\n\"The challenge is to win more matches than we did,\" said Mourinho. \"By scoring more or conceding less? I don't know.\n\n\"We lost only one match at home and in the cups we never lost, in the Europa League we never lost, but we had too many draws.\n\n\"It would be better to lose two or three matches, but win three or four more and then we would have six or eight more points, and then be in a different position in the table.\n\n\"We had lots of dominance at home, lots of chances, lots of matches where the result could and should have been 2-0 or 3-0, but in the end was 1-1.\n\n\"I know all of that, but to have a better position in the table we need to win more matches.\"\n\n\"I don't feel more or less pressure than last season. But we have to put ourselves in a position in the Premier League that allows us to fight for the title.\"\n\npoll loading Will Manchester United win the title this season? 30000+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO", "timeCrawl": "21:40:00", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2187, "date": "2017-08-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2196}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8706113", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "id": 523, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Zlatan Ibrahimovic got 17 as part of 28 in all competitions before his campaign was ended early by a knee ligament injury.\n\nThe 35-year-old was the only United player to get into double figures in the league. The Swede has since been released but Mourinho splashed \u00a375 million on Romelu Lukaku, who scored 25 Premier League goals for Everton last season.\n\nHowever, the United boss insists it is not just down to the Belgian to pick up the slack this term, telling a news conference on Friday: \"What I had in other clubs was more players scoring goals. What we had was midfielders, wingers, scoring, central defenders scoring goals at set pieces.\n\n\"We always had more goals from wingers, midfielders getting 10 goals, central defenders getting five goals and last season that didn't happen much. We were focused on the striker scoring goals and when it didn't happen we were in trouble.\"\n\nThe lack of goals contributed to 10 league draws at Old Trafford that cost the club any chance of challenging Chelsea for the title. One of which was against West Ham, United's opponents on Sunday as the new Premier League season gets underway.\n\nMourinho added: \"The challenge is to win more matches than we did, by scoring more or conceding less, I don't know.\n\n\"We lost only one match at home and in the cups we never lost, but too many draws.\n\n\"It would be better to lose two or three but win three or four more and then have six or eight more points and then a different position in the table.\n\n\"We had lots of dominance at home, lots of chances, lots when the match should be two or three nil and in the end was 1-1. But to have a better position in table we need to win more.\"\n\nMourinho has an impressive record in his second seasons at clubs, winning the title in both spells at Chelsea, as well as at Porto, Inter Milan and Real Madrid. United are one of the favourites to lift the trophy this time, despite finishing sixth and 24 points behind Chelsea last term.\n\nMourinho has added Lukaku, Victor Lindelof and Nemanja Matic for a combined cost of \u00a3147 million but has lost Ibrahimovic and Wayne Rooney while Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and Ashley Young are long-term absentees through injury.\n\nThe Portuguese coach concedes his squad is \"similar\" to the one he took charge of last season. But he insists, despite that, the title is a more realistic target.\n\nHe said: \"It's not because I have always done it that I am going to do it.\n\n\"There is no relation between others or a guarantee because I always do, but I just think naturally a manger in the second season knows the club and players better.\n\n\"We are just in a position to do quality work better than in the first.\n\n\"It's not just hope it's convinced that the quality of the team will be better, I have conditions to deliver a better one than the first.\"\n\nLast season, Mourinho eventually had to prioritise the Europa League over the Premier League in a bid to secure Champions League football. Chelsea, without European football, were able to run away with the title, as Leicester managed to do the season before.\n\nThis season, however, each of the Premier League's top seven will play in Europe, which Mourinho believes is a leveller.\n\nThe 54-year-old added: \"I think everyone -- the top seven -- are all in Europe. Last season two were not.\n\n\"This time we are all in the same basket and it will be the same for everybody.\n\n\"Some, okay, have the luck to play Tuesday or Wednesday, Saturday or Sunday, but in the end the same number of matches. There is no advantage for anyone.\"\n\nRob is ESPN FC's Manchester United correspondent.

I don't think I am in a position of moaning, crying, contesting or to say I am not happy with it,\" the Portugese continued.\n\n\"I am happy with the effort the club did and that the club managed to do 75 percent of the work before the Premier League starts and until Aug. 31.

He also feels that conditions are much better for them to clinch the title this season.\n\nThe Portuguese does not feel that he will be under less pressure than Pep Guardiola, Mauricio Pochettino or Jurgen Klopp just because they did not manage to win any trophy last season. He said, \"I'm not worried about them and I don't feel more or less pressure than last season.\"\n\nMourinho feels that United's spot in the Champions League marked the most important thing for him last season, \"I think one very important thing for us was going back to the Champions League and I think we did it by the second best possible way. For me the best is winning the title, the second best way is winning the Europa League, then the next best way is finishing second, then third, then fourth, so we did it the second best way.\"\n\nHe added: \"We don't have that route this season, unless we finish third in the group phase and we go back again to the Europa League and okay, let's try to win another European title, but we don't want it. We want to finish top two in the group phase and play against the best teams in the knockout phases.\"\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Manchester United", "timeCrawl": "10:14:00", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 33, "amb": false, "textEnd": 48}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8776120", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "id": 224, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "id": 523, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "id": 538, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

But there are not many like that, just a couple,' said Mourinho, who lost out on N'Golo Kante 12 months ago and also pursued Tottenham's Eric Dier this summer.\n\n'I thought about Matic but I never like to go to players where I think it's an impossible mission (to sign them).\n\n'When I got a call that Matic wants to play for me, I thought he was the perfect player for me. It's not just for his qualities but my relation with him and the way I know him.'\n\nIf Mourinho is feeling the pressure of maintaining his record of winning league titles within two years at Porto, Chelsea (twice), Inter Milan and Real Madrid, he's not showing it.\n\n'I'm on fire,' he smiled when asked to describe his mood. Becoming the first United manager to finish on top of the pile since Sir Alex Ferguson is great motivation for someone with his pride and ego, and many of the troubles that afflicted his first season, despite winning two cup trophies, have disappeared.\n\nMourinho likes his teams to be streetwise and physically imposing. Matic fits the bill on both counts and you wouldn't blame West Ham's players if they shrank a little in the tunnel this afternoon standing alongside him and Lukaku, Pogba and Eric Bailly.\n\n'Matic is one of those players where there are no question marks with him. He doesn't need time to adapt, he's not a young guy coming from another country, he doesn't need to learn the Premier League,' added Mourinho. 'He's 29, with five years in the Premier League and lots of experience.\n\nHe's one of those players who gives me consistency which is what I like. Matic normally plays to a certain level (holds his hand up), sometimes a little above that and sometimes a little below. But Matic is Matic. I trust that the player is going to perform, so I think he is a fantastic signing.'\n\nMatic has no question marks about him and can offer consistency, says Mourinho\n\nPaul Pogba is likely to benefit from Matic joining as it frees the Frenchman up to go forward\n\nMourinho could field the most expensive starting XI the Premier League has ever seen, featuring the country's two most expensive players -- Pogba and Lukaku -- costing a total of around \u00a3400m.\n\nBoth they and Manchester City have been accused of recklessly buying their way to success because of the vast sums involved but Mourinho doesn't think it provides any guarantees in itself and says Tottenham, who have not spent anything in this window, are also challengers.\n\n'Of course to buy lots of good players is important and better squads are better equipped to win the title. That is normal but not enough,' he stresses.\n\n'I think every one of us in his own way is equipped to do it. I think Tottenham without any spending is equipped to win the title because they have fantastic team, fantastic manager, great stability and have been together for a long time.\n\nMourinho conceded that there are plenty of other teams with the squads to win the league\n\n'Man City, fantastic manager, great spending, already very good players, are equipped. Arsenal the same, they didn't sell the top players like Ozil, Alexis, that some expected. Liverpool is equipped. Chelsea were the champions easily, they lost some players but bought some players. I just think the competition can be better than ever.'\n\nMourinho's confidence is largely because he feels United are a club that now carries his influence. 'I was thinking I needed three transfer windows, but after two I have a good group and the club as a football club is much better equipped.\n\n'We are much better organised at every level. The medical department is better, the logistics, how we organise training routines, the analysis department.\n\n'I am doing the work that I've done with every other club so we go for it this season. We are going to try to win the title, we are going to try to give a hard fight to the top teams in the Champions League and as you know I always loved the English cups.'\n\nThe Portuguese claims to have optimised the way Manchester United do things in all areas\n\nHaving been accused last season of being too downbeat and complaining about his lonely life in Manchester, Mourinho enters 2017-18 cutting a different figure.\n\nHe lets it be known he arrived at the club's training ground at 9.30 on Friday morning and worked flat out until the evening when he dashed back to his hotel to watch Arsenal beat Leicester, his busy day punctuated by a two-hour training session in the afternoon.\n\n'I was not sitting around having tea,' he says. 'My dedication to my job is always the maximum, even more than when I started.\n\n'At the end of the season we will see the results, but I look forward to it with optimism and enthusiasm. I want to play West Ham -- a difficult match -- then go to Swansea for another difficult match. I want the Champions League to start. I am on fire.'", "timeCrawl": "21:33:00", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8846059", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "id": 538, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

with Twitter Share this article with Google Plus Share this article with Whatsapp Share this article through email Share this article through sms\n\nJose Mourinho is bracing himself to miss out on landing a fourth and final summer signing, with Manchester United likely to go into the new season without the winger they wanted.\n\nWhy no-one can stop the Premier League title from heading back to Manchester this season\n\nThe Portuguese coach had made no secret of his desire to bring in four new faces before the new season started, wanting a striker, centre-back, midfielder and wide-man.\n\nThe club moved quickly to bring in three of those positions, but they remain without a winger after Inter Milan played hard ball over a fee for Croatian schemer Ivan Perisic.\n\nWhile United will remain vigilant in the transfer market right up until deadline day, Mourinho is losing faith in their ability to do a deal and says he is ready to use his existing options instead.\n\n'We got a centre midfielder, we got a striker,' he said at his pre-match press conference ahead of United's Premier League opener against West Ham.\n\nIvan Perisic's Serie A seasonChances created61Games36Assists11Goals11\n\nShare\n\n'Obviously [we wanted] a player for another position playing from the sides, but we have players and if you cannot strengthen the team in these areas, we have people that we trust and we go for it.'\n\nHe continued: 'I'm happy with the effort the club did, I'm happy that the club managed to do 75 per cent of the work before the Premier League starts.\n\nREAD MORE | Why the Premier League title is heading back to Manchester\n\n'And if, until 31 August, the remaining 25 per cent don't arrive, I will not moan.

And he has now lit the blue touch paper for an assault on the title by insisting that the United team now has the Mourinho stamp running through its DNA.\n\nThe Reds spent \u00a3167million last year to strengthen a squad that has taken the club back into the Champions League - and have followed that up by lavishing another \u00a3147m on Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof.\n\nMourinho said: \"In so many ways, this is now my team.\n\n\"In terms of the squad, this is my second summer transfer window and, in this complicated world of the football market, I was thinking it would take three windows. But I now have a good group, a club much better equipped and much better organised in the areas that support the first-team squad.\n\n\"We are much better organised at every level - the medical department is better, the structure is better organised, the logistics are better, the training routines are better organised. We are much stronger as a team, in terms of analysis.\n\n\"I am doing the same work I have done at every other club and I feel this club is now much better. We have a good squad, good numbers, with people like Ashley Young, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and maybe Zlatan to come later. Tjey will be like new players for us at some point. We are going to try to win the title, try to give a tough fight to the top teams in the Champions League.\n\n\"And, as you know, I have always loved the English cups and I have always tried to give them the respect because I like being in the finals. So we go for it this season.\"\n\nMourinho made history by becoming the first United manager to lift silverware in his first season, but a sixth-placed finish in the Premier League was way below expectations.\n\nThere were constant suggestions he was finding it hard to settle in Manchester, with his family still living in London.\n\nMourinho is continuing to live in the five-star luxury of the Lowry Hotel on the banks of the Irwell.\n\nAnd he insisted: \"The only thing I demand from myself is to work hard every day - like I already do. I give everything and then, normally, the results are a good consequence of that work. I don't put any pressure on myself and say 'I have to do this or I have to do that'.\n\n\"My dedication to my job is always at the maximum - and even more now than when I first started. I am on fire!\"\n\n* MOURINHO insists the Premier League title will not be bought.\n\nThe Manchester United boss has splashed out \u00a3147million on new players this summer -- but been outspent by Mancunian rivals City, who have lavished more than \u00a3200million on Pep Guardiola's squad.\n\nMourinho, however, believes the race for the title is wide open.\n\nHe said: \"Of course, to buy lots of good players is important and better squads are better equipped to win the title. That's normal. But that's not enough.\n\n\"I think every one of the top teams are equipped to do it. I think Tottenham, without any spending, are equipped to win the title. They have a fantastic team and a fantastic manager, with great stability because they have been together a long time.\n\n\"So without spending they are equipped.\n\n\"Man City - fantastic manager, great spending, already have very good players, so they are equipped. Arsenal the same. Great experience in the manager, same team, didn't sell top players like Ozil and Alexis.\n\n\"Liverpool are equipped. Chelsea are the champions and won the championship easily.

At his previous clubs he has always managed to win the title in his second season and at his present one there is an expectation of something a little more dynamic than finishing sixth in the table and qualifying for the Champions League via the Europa competition.\n\nNaturally the manager denies it. In fact before Sunday's opener at home to West Ham he even admitted to looking forward to the season with the quality he now has at his disposal. \"The only thing I have to do is work every day like I always do, the only demand on me is the one I put on myself. I don't put any extra pressure on myself because I always give everything, then normally the results are a good consequence of that work. My dedication to my job is always at the maximum, even more now than when I started, and I believe at the end of the season we will see the results. With these players I am looking forward to the season with optimism, with enthusiasm, I can't wait for the Champions League to start and the chance to play the top clubs. I am on fire.\"\n\nMourinho can rarely be accused of underselling himself or his clubs, though even in combustible mode he still bore a message for his employers as well as the nation's back pages, congratulating the United board on securing 75% of the transfer targets he outlined early in the window. The point he is making is that the other 25% of intended business remains to be completed. Mourinho requested four new players, United have bought him three.\n\nSpeculation that Danny Rose is the player still at large after United's expensive captures of Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof only intensified when the Tottenham full-back spoke of wanting to move back north, though Mourinho batted that subject away with a carefully phrased answer. \"I think I should not comment because Mauricio [Pochettino] would not be happy if I comment, Mr Levy would not be happy if I comment and because I had nothing to do with that interview,\" the United manager said. \"I just read it the same way that you did. Danny Rose is a Spurs player and it is not my problem at all.\"\n\nWhat could turn out to be a problem for Mourinho is a lack of width and crossing ability in his present squad, something that a player such as Rose would rectify and provide a more reliable service from the wings for Lukaku. Given that the manager has frequently complained of a lack of balance in the side, and that it took \u00a390m to prise Lukaku away from Everton ahead of Chelsea, it would not be the greatest surprise to see United spend big again before the end of the month if they are concerned about the striker becoming too isolated.\n\nManchester City have already outspent their neighbours and may not be finished either, though Mourinho believes all the top clubs are well-equipped to make a title challenge. \"Buying good players is important, and generally the better squad win the titles, but money alone is not enough,\" he said. \"I think Tottenham without any spending is equipped to win the title because they have a fantastic team, a fantastic manager and great stability. Arsenal and Liverpool the same, Chelsea are the champions, it is hard to say which one is better prepared. I just think the competition can be better than ever but I think you will notice a difference in quality with United this season. I think we are ready. We are going to try to win the title.\"\n\nOne of the reasons Mourinho feels that way is the solidity Matic will bring in front of the back four. The Serbia midfielder was one of the mainstays of the Chelsea side that won the title in Mourinho's second spell at Stamford Bridge and the manager admitted that until a phone call informed him otherwise, he thought there was no point even trying to wrest him from the champions. \"I could see when I first came to United that we needed a Matic-type player,\" he said. \"But there are not many around and I do not like to go after players where it is an impossible mission. Then I heard that he wanted to join United and could make it happen.\n\n\"I am very happy to have him because he is one of those players with no question marks. He doesn't need time to adapt.

We like to play, we like Premier League, we like the opening match. So let's enjoy!\n\n'Honestly, as a spectator and as a fan, I have enjoyed the Friday match, I have also enjoyed some Saturday matches that I had a chance to look.\n\n'So hopefully today we can keep giving good football and entertaining times for the people who love football in this country.'\n\nUnited are in action against West Ham at Old Trafford on Sunday, though surprisingly summer signing Victor Lindelof was left out of the team to take on the Hammers.\n\nInstead, Mourinho picked a centre-back pairing of Eric Bailly and Phil Jones, while Daley Blind was named at left-back ahead of Matteo Darmian.\n\nWriting in the match programme before the game, Mourinho once again reiterated his belief that this United team are the best group of players he has ever worked with.\n\n'That's what I love most about this squad: the players always give everything,' he wrote. 'It makes me so happy to be manager of this club, working with these guys.\n\n'As I told them all recently, during my long career, I have never worked with a group I like as much as I like them.\n\n'Our three new signings - Victor, Romelu and Nemanja - are all very lucky to have joined a group like this, because it is so easy to work with them.'\n\nMORE: Victor Lindelof dropped from Manchester United squad due to form, not fitness", "timeCrawl": "15:34:00", "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-13", "textStart": 137, "amb": false, "textEnd": 148}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8933831", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "id": 673, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

We were focused on the striker scoring goals and when it didn't happen we were in trouble.\n\n\"The challenge is to win more matches than we did, by scoring more or conceding less I don't know.

like when he joked with a posse of bald reporters that he has no difficulty changing hairstyles on the day he paraded a bold new crew cut, there were plenty of occasions last season when a glum-faced Jose Mourinho looked anything but satisfied with life at Manchester United.\n\nTrailed persistently by hungry \u00adpaparazzi camped outside The Lowry Hotel, which he still calls home, 200 miles from his family in London, \u00adunafraid to scold players in public and at loggerheads with the authorities over a chaotic fixture schedule that he felt undermined any real hopes of his team being competitive in the Premier League title race, the Portuguese often cut a burdened, brooding figure.\n\nIt all felt very different at United's Carrington training ground on Friday, though. His underlying frustration that United have so far failed to land the wide player he craves aside, a \u00addecidedly relaxed Mourinho was in jocular mood.\n\nHe had given his players the \u00admorning off but was joking that, even then, he had been so busy he had not been able to find time for a cup of tea and was looking forward to clocking off in time to make the short journey back to his hotel suite to watch Arsenal take on Leicester in the season opener.\n\n\"I look forward to the season with optimism, with enthusiasm,\" Mourinho announced. \"I want to play. I want to play West Ham on Sunday, a difficult match. Then I want to go to Swansea, a difficult match. Then I want the Champions League to start. I want, I want! ... I'm on fire ... But I will behave on the touchline!\"\n\nThere was an impish, mischievous glint in Mourinho's eye as he referenced his touchline behaviour, and while it was generally very good \u00adduring the second half of last season after a \u00adseries of early incidents when he \u00adconcluded, after being collared for kicking a water bottle, that there is one rule for him and another for \u00adeveryone else, who knows what might materialise over the next 10 months?\n\nThe Manchester United manager has been no stranger to winning titles in his debut seasons at clubs but the second year is traditionally the \u00admoment he makes his move. He has won the \u00addomestic championship in the second season at every one of his previous clubs, and while no one should underestimate the scale of the challenge he faced in successfully toppling \u00adBarcelona in 2011-12, his Real Madrid side had only one rival to worry about. Here there are five.\n\nTalking tactics: How Man Utd can play Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford together 02:34\n\nMourinho was happy to trumpet the qualities of all, even making a point of lavishing praise on his long-standing adversaries Pep Guardiola and Arsene Wenger. \"Manchester City have a \u00adfantastic manager, great spending, \u00adalready very good players,\" Mourinho said. \"They're equipped. I think \u00adTottenham, without spending, are equipped to win the title because they have a fantastic team, fantastic manager, great stability.\n\n\"Arsenal the same. A great, experienced manager, the same team. They didn't sell, as some were expecting, players like Mesut Ozil, Alexis [Sanchez]. They're equipped. Liverpool, they're equipped. Chelsea is the champion, lost some players, bought some players, they're equipped. So it's difficult to say which of us is better equipped. I just think the competition can be better than ever.\"\n\nAs for United, Mourinho admits he could do with \u00adanother transfer window before the squad is sculpted exactly to his requirements but he expressed far more \u00adconviction about their title \u00adprospects this term than 12 months ago. At the very least, his imposing team should be hard to beat. \"I was thinking three transfer windows, I need that,\" he said. \"But two transfer windows, a good group, a club that is much better equipped, much better organised in the areas that support the first-team squad.\n\n\"We are much better organised at every level - the medical department is better, the structure that organises the logistics is much better. The \u00adtraining routines are much better \u00adorganised. We are much stronger as a team. I feel the club is much better so we go for it this season. We're going to try to win the title. We're going to try to give a hard fight to the top teams in Europe in the Champions League and, as you know, I always loved the English cups.\"\n\nThe signing that has perhaps \u00ademboldened Mourinho the most is \u00adNemanja Matic, not just because the Serb's \u00a340\u2009million arrival from Chelsea weakens a direct rival but because he will offer a control, consistency and physicality at the base of the midfield that, aside from bringing greater \u00adbalance to the side, could help to \u00ad\u00adliberate Paul Pogba.\n\nIndeed, if United are to get the best out of Pogba this season playing on the counter-attack as Mourinho \u00adintends, the success that Matic has \u00adanchoring the midfield and Romelu Lukaku and Henrikh Mkhitaryan \u00adenjoy in providing a mobile outlet in attack will be crucial.\n\n\"When I joined last year I thought immediately that we needed a kind of Matic but there are not many,\" Mourinho said. \"But I was not thinking of it because I always thought I never like to go to players that are the impossible mission and I felt there is no chance [of Chelsea selling him].\n\n\"When this season I got the call that Matic wants to play for me, wants to play for Man United and we can make it happen, I thought, 'it's the perfect player for me'. Not just for his qualities but also for my relationship with him, the way I know him. He's one of those players with no question marks in front. He doesn't need time to adapt to England. He's one of those players that gives me what I like in players, which is consistency. So I think he was a fantastic signing for us.\"\n\nMourinho is primed and waiting.", "timeCrawl": "21:52:00", "sim": 0.529411792755127, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8847560", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "id": 14, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "id": 25, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "id": 435, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "id": 673, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "id": 822, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Zlatan Ibrahimovic got 17 as part of 28 in all competitions before his campaign was ended early by a knee ligament injury.\n\n\"At Manchester United, we play to win and that's the mentality when I get on the pitch\". The Swede has since been released but Mourinho splashed \u00a375 million on Romelu Lukaku, who scored 25 Premier League goals for Everton last season.\n\n\"Twenty-five per cent means one of four\", Mourinho told a news conference on Friday. What we had was midfielders, wingers, scoring, central defenders scoring goals at set pieces. \"I think also in this season, this will happen\".\n\n\"We didn't buy full-backs for five, six years\", said Guardiola.\n\nThe duo were paired together in attack during the closing weeks of last term and started City's final pre-season friendly in tandem, each striker finding the net in a 3-0 win over West Ham in Helsinki. There has been much debate over whether Sergio Aguero is Pep Guardiola's man up front but he still managed 20 goals in 31 Premier League starts past year and looks the number one option going into the new season.\n\n\"We had lots of dominance at home, lots of chances, lots when the match should be two or three nil and in the end was 1-1\".\n\n\"We are champions. We have to face every game in the right way\".\n\nChelsea has done much more selling than purchasing, allowing several players to leave the club this summer. Sweden's Victor Lindelof looks the ideal partner for Eric Bailly in the centre of defence and Nemanja Matic is a proven asset on the defensive side of midfield duties.\n\nThe Portuguese coach concedes his squad is \"similar\" to the one he took charge of last season. Matic did everything in United red that he did in Chelsea blue, and you struggle to think of many reasons why Chelsea would let him go to a title rival, as he instantly improves United. \"It's normal that the players and supporters are going to be celebrating for a period of time, but we have had to come down to reality\", Brighton boss Hughton said. \"The club was clever like that because we anticipated what we needed.\" .\n\n\"Anthony Knockaert seems to be one of Brighton's better players\".\n\nLast season, Mourinho eventually had to prioritise the Europa League over the Premier League in a bid to secure Champions League football.\n\nAnother season without silverware will raise serious doubts as to whether he really is the man to carry City to the summit of European football for the first time.\n\nThe buzz may have gone but the biggest question before the coming season remains whether two of the highest-profile managers in the world can deliver on all the hype surrounding them.", "timeCrawl": "20:04:00", "sim": 0.529411792755127, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8837939", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "id": 523, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

We'll take a look at each team in our aggregated predicted table, counting down from No. 20 to No. 1, and also reflect on some issues surrounding the league as kickoff approaches on Friday. Follow along with everything here.\n\nEver since he strode to a podium on July 2, 2004 and, with all the sincerity and pompousness in the world, declared himself \"a special one,\" Jose Mourinho has been defined as much by his personality and mind games as anything his teams have accomplished on the field. He is both instigator and inadvertent entertainer, a polarizing figure tailor-made for today's 24/7 media frenzies.\n\nYet there is a brilliance to Mourinho that turned \"a special one\" into \"the Special One,\" and turned an arrogant Premier League newbie into one of the world's great managers. It's that brilliance that is responsible for a phenomenon that defines Mourinho far better than his nickname: the Portuguese boss has never failed to win a title in his second full season at a club.\n\nCall it the Jose Mourinho Second Season phenomenon. Or come up with something more catchy. Call it whatever you want. Just know that it is real, and even more impressive than it sounds.\n\nIt was birthed in Porto, when a 41-year-old Mourinho, in his second full season in charge, led FC Porto to not only the domestic title but a Champions League crown. The success propelled him to London, where he lifted the Premier League trophy in his second season at Chelsea. In 2009-10, year two at Inter Milan, Mourinho won a Serie A-Copa Italia-Champions League treble. In 2011-12, year two in Madrid, he unseated Barcelona as La Liga champs, bringing Real its first title since 2008. And then finally, he reclaimed the Premier League title in 2014-15, the 15th season of his managerial career and year two of stint two at Chelsea.\n\n[ Follow FC Yahoo on social media: Twitter | Facebook ]\n\nSo in five second seasons, Mourinho has won five domestic titles, two Champions Leagues, and two domestic cups. It's an imperious record that's too strong to be considered mere coincidence.\n\nThat's in part because it runs counter to \"second season syndrome,\" the commonly discussed trend that managers struggle in year two of a job. According to research carried out by Bwin, over the last decade, of the 191 managers hired at a club in Europe's big five leagues and retained after year one, only 71 (37.2 percent) won more points per match in that second season.\n\nThere is some self-selection bias inherent here. The managers who earned a second go-around -- who \"selected\" themselves for the study -- likely fared well in year one, making year-two improvement more difficult. But that doesn't damage the contrast between Mourinho and the norm. Mourinho has performed well enough to warrant a second year at all six of his managerial stops. On the first five, that second year has brought excellence.\n\nWhich brings us to his sixth stop, and his sixth second season. Since 2007, no manager in Europe's big five has won a domestic title in his second season after finishing outside the top five in his first. That is what Mourinho will attempt at Manchester United in 2017-18. That is the size of the Special One's task.\n\nPiling on top of it is the level of competition, which could be higher than the Premier League has ever seen. Chelsea, the reigning champion, has fortified its ranks. Manchester City, the title favorite, has strengthened. Both have managers entering their second seasons as well. Pep Guardiola has had another summer to implement his vision, both on the field and in the transfer market. Antonio Conte, having had his first full offseason, should have his side even better prepared. And then there's Tottenham, England's best team over the past two seasons by a significant margin. And Liverpool, still building under a former title-winning boss in Jurgen Klopp.\n\nRead More\n\nMourinho has had second-season success, but never up against anything like this.\n\nAnd so 2017-18 presents him with his greatest test in over a decade. Mourinho's past two seasons, one at Chelsea and one at United, have seen him take 1.56 points per game, well off his rest-of-career pace. Rumors of player mutiny ended his second Stamford Bridge stay after less than two-and-a-half seasons. Thirty-eight games of relatively dull soccer tarnished his first at Old Trafford. It even invited questions: Has Mourinho lost his touch? Has the rest of Europe caught up? Has his brilliance dulled?\n\nAs ever, we will find out in year two. Mourinho, like his superstar managerial brethren, has had another offseason to mold his club to his liking; to bring in his players; to ingrain his training methods; to drill home his system; to stamp his authority on everything. When he has had that chance in the past, results have followed. And so have trophies. Always.\n\nIt is the picture-perfect opportunity to shrug off the doubters. The ideal proving ground for a man who considers himself peerless and exceptional in his profession.\n\nIt is also the very type of circumstances and pressure under which the Jose Mourinho Second Season phenomenon could crack.\n\nMore soccer coverage from FC Yahoo:\n\n* Leicester's title doesn't appear to have changed EPL hierarchy\n\n* Premier League previews: Newcastle United and Crystal Palace\n\n* Will City's spending lead to a dynasty for Guardiola?", "timeCrawl": "12:37:00", "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2004-07-02", "textStart": 313, "amb": false, "textEnd": 325}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8791675", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "id": 33, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "id": 523, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Email\n\nRegardless of whether Daniel Levy is a tougher negotiator than Samuel L Jackson, Jose Mourinho is intent on strengthening Manchester United's left-hand side.\n\nDanny Rose was identified last month as another Premier League specialist to convert United from also-rans into title challengers, only the club had intended on monitoring Rose's progress over the forthcoming season before considering a bid next year. That changed with the left-back's midweek interview with a tabloid.\n\nRose has stopped just short of burning bridges with Tottenham but he has lit the match while fluttering eyelashes in United's direction. \"I hear Mourinho may want one or two more players,\" Rose teased and he heard right. Rose and Ivan Perisic are two options United are considering to strengthen their left flank.\n\nThe selections of right-footers Matteo Darmian and Jesse Lingard in the Super Cup were veiled messages to Ed Woodward to clinch a fourth signing. Mourinho could have used the left-footed Daley Blind or Anthony Martial, but Blind endured a poor pre-season and last that Mourinho reminded Martial he had to complement class with consistency.\n\nAmid the frenzied speculation surrounding the Paris Saint-Germain right-back Serge Aurier, it is worth remembering what Mourinho said about United's lopsided backline after he moved Henrikh Mkhitaryan to left-back against Liverpool in January.\n\n\"When you have Antonio Valencia playing as a right winger you cannot defend with two players, you need that third player to give some cover inside and to keep some balances, and he [Darmian] did that well,\" Mourinho said.\n\nMourinho has effectively disregarded Darmian as a right-back and the Italian's attacking input is borderline non-existent. He is one of the few full-backs at an elite Premier League club who is picked to just defend and that is partly why Mourinho is attracted to Rose.\n\nWhen Spurs had Rose and Kyle Walker, the pair were full-backs when the team were without the ball and wingers with it. Whenever they pushed into the opposition's half, Eric Dier - formerly a centre half - would drop back between central defenders Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, who would split to accommodate him in a back three. That tactic safeguarded Spurs from counter-attacks and they conceded the fewest goals in the Premier League last term.\n\nMourinho had possibly hoped to incorporate a similar tactic with Luke Shaw. He still might get to do so if Levy does not buckle, but after three years of fitness problems, misfortune and questionable professionalism, there is no slack left to cut for Shaw. There are few players United have patiently waited three years to blossom, so Mourinho could pluck Rose.\n\nValencia would benefit. United were concerned about how fatigued the Ecuadorian was towards the end of last season and, at 32, his workload will have to be eased via an equally energetic winger on the opposite side. Rose is 27 and has been playing for one of the most tireless teams in the Premier League, whereas United were bottom of the distance covered table in April, so that is one major perk to having Rose.\n\nHe would also bring flexibility. United have trialled three at the back throughout pre-season and started with it in Skopje, albeit with inappropriate personnel like Lingard and Darmian, and Rose's natural width could justify a permanent switch.\n\nIt is already noticeable United are trying to get Nemanja Matic to supplement the attack whenever in possession, secure in the fact they have three centre halves holding the fort behind him. Committing seven forwards is arguably required after a profligate season which ended with a measly 54 Premier League goals.\n\nMourinho could alternatively stick with a conventional 4-3-3 and use Matic as the third 'sitter', which would still allow Ander Herrera to support Paul Pogba. Whether it is a back four or three, Henrikh Mkhitaryan would be positioned centrally - which is where he prefers to operate - and Mourinho has hinted at starting Romelu Lukaku with Marcus Rashford.\n\nWhether Lukaku has a partner or not, his stature demands a reliable crosser and United lack one with Valencia, whose hit-and-hope strategy invariably bounces off the first man, and there is not a single specialist winger in Mourinho's arsenal except Martial, who began as a centre forward.\n\nEighteen of Lukaku's 85 Premier League goals have come off his head and Rose would arrive at United expected to attack more than defend.\n\nBut first they need to negotiate.\n\nGet all the latest Manchester United news first with our new app. Download it here now.", "timeCrawl": "05:16:00", "sim": 0.501960813999176, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8541397", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "id": 140, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Horticulture", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Horticulture", "id": 476, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

But watching United in \u00admidweek, I couldn't help thinking that, like last season, they looked fairly disjointed rather than a fully cohesive unit.\n\nThat might be a bit harsh, because they won trophies last time out -- two, or three, depending on your viewpoint.\n\nBut when you think of great United teams and great Mourinho teams, the one thing they have always had is \u00adcohesion and it was obvious what they were trying to achieve.\n\nI said at the start of last season that over the course of the campaign, with a winner like Mourinho at the helm, United would be difficult to beat and would win trophies, and it turned out to be true.\n\nThe reason they didn't challenge for first and second in the league, though, was that there were too many draws and that was because he didn't know his best XI.\n\nI also said that Mourinho needed to work out quickly which was his best front four and it took him a long time to do that, which came back to haunt him. And this \u00adseason he could face the same problems if he doesn't quickly work out his best partnerships all over the field.\n\nWhat's his best pairing down the right or left?\n\nWhat's his best central-defensive pairing and which two work best with David De Gea?\n\nWho are the best two holders - Carrick plus one? Paul Pogba plus one? Nemanja Matic plus one?\n\nThere are so many imponderables for Mourinho and United, and I'm not yet convinced that the draws from last season are automatically going to be turned into wins this year.\n\nIf we were all to pick our best starting line-ups from that squad we'd come to the same conclusion, barring one, maybe two exceptions. But picking your 'Galacticos' doesn't always make the best team - how many of us would have selected Antonio Valencia at right-back last year, for example?\n\nSo Mourinho needs to work that out quickly and Sunday's clash at Old Trafford will give us an idea of whether or not he is on the right track.\n\nOn Tuesday, United were \u00adbattered by Real and, having seen the Spaniards take on arch-rivals Barcelona in New York 10 days earlier, I couldn't help but notice how sharp they looked.\n\nBoth teams had a right good go at each other and it does kind of make you a little concerned as to how Spanish teams in particular come back looking fresh and sharp, they hit the ground running and look technically very good.\n\nWhereas a lot of the English clubs have played five, six or seven pre-season games and still look a little bit leggy - perhaps unsurprising given their global pre-seasons tours, \u00adsomething clubs should seriously reconsider.\n\nOf course, United will have wanted to beat Real, but the game that matters is West Ham.\n\nAnd the mantra that's trotted out by every manager and every coach in every dressing room ahead of the first game of the season will have been the same:\n\n\"Don't lose, give \u00adyourself something \u00adpositive to start the \u00adseason with and \u00adsomething, whether it's three points or a point on the board, to hang on to and move forward in the first three weeks before the international break.\"\n\nMourinho will have said the same and as he sends his men out with those words ringing in their ears he will hope they respond by showing him those partnerships are already building.\n\n* Pick up the Mirror on Sunday and Monday for your bumper football pullout featuring all of the action and all of the goals!\n\npoll loading Will Manchester United win the title this season? 31000+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO", "timeCrawl": "05:13:00", "sim": 0.4941176474094391, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8874531", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "id": 14, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "id": 25, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "id": 28, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "id": 140, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "id": 523, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "id": 673, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

potential target.\n\nHere Samuel Luckhurst has his say on whether the England international could be the right man for the Red Devils.\n\nRegardless of whether Daniel Levy is a tougher negotiator than Samuel L Jackson, Jose Mourinho is intent on strengthening Manchester United's left-hand side.\n\nDanny Rose was identified last month as another Premier League specialist to convert United from also-rans into title challengers, only the club had intended on monitoring Rose's progress over the forthcoming season before considering a bid next year. That changed with the left-back's midweek interview with a tabloid.\n\nRose has stopped just short of burning bridges with Tottenham but he has lit the match while fluttering eyelashes in United's direction. \"I hear Mourinho may want one or two more players,\" Rose teased and he heard right. Rose and Ivan Perisic are two options United are considering to strengthen their left flank.\n\nThe selections of right-footers Matteo Darmian and Jesse Lingard in the Super Cup defeat were veiled messages to Ed Woodward to clinch a fourth signing. Mourinho could have used the left-footed Daley Blind or Anthony Martial, but Blind endured a poor pre-season and last that Mourinho reminded Martial he had to complement class with consistency.\n\nAmid the frenzied speculation surrounding the Paris Saint-Germain right-back Serge Aurier, it is worth remembering what Mourinho said about United's lopsided backline after he moved Henrikh Mkhitaryan to left-back against Liverpool in January.\n\n\"When you have Antonio Valencia playing as a right winger you cannot defend with two players, you need that third player to give some cover inside and to keep some balances, and he (Darmian) did that well,\" Mourinho said.\n\nMourinho has effectively disregarded Darmian as a right-back and the Italian's attacking input is borderline non-existent. He is one of the few full-backs at an elite Premier League club who is picked to just defend and that is partly why Mourinho is attracted to Rose.\n\nWhen Spurs had Rose and Kyle Walker, the pair were full-backs when the team were without the ball and wingers with it. Whenever they pushed into the opposition's half, Eric Dier - formerly a centre half - would drop back between central defenders Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, who would split to accommodate him in a back three. That tactic safeguarded Spurs from counter-attacks and they conceded the fewest goals in the Premier League last term.\n\nMourinho had possibly hoped to incorporate a similar tactic with Luke Shaw. He still might get to do so if Levy does not buckle, but after three years of fitness problems, misfortune and questionable professionalism, there is no slack left to cut for Shaw. There are few players United have patiently waited three years to blossom, so Mourinho could pluck Rose.\n\nValencia would benefit. United were concerned about how fatigued the Ecuadorian was towards the end of last season and, at 32, his workload will have to be eased via an equally energetic winger on the opposite side. Rose is 27 and has been playing for one of the most tireless teams in the Premier League, whereas United were bottom of the distance covered table in April, so that is one major perk to having Rose.\n\nHe would also bring flexibility. United have trialled three at the back throughout pre-season and started with it in Skopje, albeit with inappropriate personnel like Lingard and Darmian, and Rose's natural width could justify a permanent switch.\n\nIt is already noticeable United are trying to get Nemanja Matic to supplement the attack whenever in possession, secure in the fact they have three centre halves holding the fort behind him. Committing seven forwards is arguably required after a profligate season which ended with a measly 54 Premier League goals.\n\nMourinho could alternatively stick with a conventional 4-3-3 and use Matic as the third 'sitter', which would still allow Ander Herrera to support Paul Pogba. Whether it is a back four or three, Henrikh Mkhitaryan would be positioned centrally - which is where he prefers to operate - and Mourinho has hinted at starting Romelu Lukaku with Marcus Rashford.\n\nWhether Lukaku has a partner or not, his stature demands a reliable crosser and United lack one with Valencia, whose hit-and-hope strategy invariably bounces off the first man, and there is not a single specialist winger in Mourinho's arsenal except Martial, who began as a centre forward.\n\nEighteen of Lukaku's 85 Premier League goals have come off his head and Rose would arrive at United expected to attack more than defend.\n\nBut first they need to negotiate.", "timeCrawl": "09:24:00", "sim": 0.4862745106220245, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8578222", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "id": 140, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Horticulture", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Horticulture", "id": 476, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

that's his successful style\n\nJose Mourinho has had Second Season Syndrome for a while now.\n\nOnly for him, rather than SSS meaning a drop in form after overachieving in a first campaign, it's the season where he makes his move and wins the league.\n\nCan he do it again with United? There's no reason why not. But what is for sure - he will go about it his way.\n\nLast season there were a lot of complaints about his style of play. But this is Jose Mourinho. That IS his style of play.\n\nIn big matches he's careful and plays on the counter. He's always been that way.\n\nHis Chelsea teams were great on the counter-attack.\n\nPeople have always been reluctant to praise his sides.\n\nYet Antonio Conte did exactly the same last season, won the league and everyone was gushing!\n\nEven playing the way he did with United last season, Jose still won two trophies.\n\nAnd they went on an amazing unbeaten run.\n\nOK, it was not a pretty run but if they could have converted some of those draws into wins they would have been battling for the title.\n\nPep has a way of playing and don't ask him to change. Tony Pulis has his way.\n\nIt's the same with Jose. I get annoyed when people say 'did you see how he played?' Why are they surprised?\n\nHe might tweak his style now and again but essentially it's his way. It's not a crime.\n\nAnd he can turn on the style if he needs to anyway. The task he had to overcome Barcelona when he arrived at Real Madrid in 2010 was a hell of a job.\n\nBarca had an amazing forward line with Messi, Villa, Sanchez and Pedro to choose from but Real amassed 100 points and won the league by nine points.\n\nThey scored 121 goals - the most in the history of La Liga. Yet, they were still regarded as a team that did not play fancy football.\n\nThey were thought of as not as flamboyant as Barca. But look at the numbers.\n\nTime will tell if he has the armoury to do the same with United.\n\nHe will miss Zlatan Ibrahimovich. He's a big character, charismatic, scored goals but was also important as a leader, as a pro others can look up to.\n\nHe had that Man United vibe.\n\nAnd it shouldn't fall entirely on Romelu Lukaku to replace him. Others have to help like Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford.\n\nBut, of course, people will look to Lukaku. Can he answer the call? I think so.\n\nHe's stepped up every time. When he was at West Brom he was superb and then he smashed records at Everton. He has shown he is not a one-season wonder. He's ticked every box.\n\nNow he needs to prove he can now play when a team sits deep, when they are bang up for it because they are playing against United - no disrespect to Everton. He needs to grab that important away goal in Europe when United are struggling.\n\nHe's still young with lots to learn. I wasn't the same player at 29 as I was at 24. But I am confident in him.\n\nNemanja Matic is a good signing for United too. It's great when there's an understanding, love, respect between a boss and a player. Jose clearly likes him -he's signed him three times!\n\nAnd both Lukaku and Matic know the league. That's key. You don't have to wait months for them to bed in, there are no worries about can they handle the winter months and the rush of fixtures.\n\nMy one question about United is where does Rashford fit in?\n\nAfter bursting on to the scene under Louis Van Gaal, he waited patiently last season and then took his chance when Ibra was injured. He will now find himself out wide again or on the bench.\n\nFor a young talent to improve he needs to be on the field. What would have happened to Michael Owen if he'd had to wait? Or me? You need game time. I hope Mourinho can find a way - but that's why being a manager is so difficult.\n\nEverything looked rosy at Spurs at the end of last season.\n\nYes, they just missed out on the title but they have a young squad, lots of talent, all on long contracts, a great manager, a new stadium being built.\n\nBut there are now signs that all is not well in paradise.\n\nKyle Walker has left, Danny Rose is not happy and Eric Dier has been rumoured to want a transfer too.\n\nIt just shows to be a top, top club you need to pay top, top wages. And to win trophies. And Spurs haven't been able to offer either of those.\n\nMoney is bound to be tight - they have a new stadium to fund. I know how hard that hit us at Arsenal.\n\nHaving said all that, I really like the way Mauricio Pochettino has handled the situation.\n\nHe admits they need players in, that they need competition so players aren't resting on their laurels, especially with the Champions League to deal with.\n\nBut he is not panicking and throwing his toys out of the pram.\n\nAnd that sends a good message to the players he has: 'I trust you.'\n\nIt would be easy for him to moan about money. Yes, he is putting subtle pressure on chairman Daniel Levy but still being upbeat.\n\nThat positive outlook helps a club move forward. He's thinking about what he has, not what he doesn't have. That's healthy.\n\nI'm not saying they shouldn't buy. They should - as Poch admits.\n\nBut one thing that gives Spurs a huge advantage over the other top six sides is that today he can put out pretty much the same team that has played the last two or three seasons. That's a big boost.", "timeCrawl": "11:49:00", "sim": 0.4274509847164154, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8910084", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

However, United manager Jose Mourinho has always stressed the point of making four signings this summer; so, the fourth one is yet to be finalised.\n\nUnited are primarily on the lookout of a winger, and after having failed to land Ivan Perisic from Inter Milan and also Real Madrid's Gareth Bale, they are looking for options elsewhere. Manchester United seem to have their eyes set on winger Federico Chiesa, who plays for Fiorentina.\n\nIt is no secret that Perisic is Mourinho's first choice target as winger, but Inter Milan are not ready to let their player go on the cheap. Though Inter are ready to sell, money seems to have become a major obstacle in the deal. And about Bale, that was always a less likely move, to steal the Welshman from Real Madrid.\n\nAll Nigerian Soccer states that Mourinho now wants Chiesa. This may not be his first choice, but there are plenty of positives about the player, who is just 19 years old, and can prove to be a long term investment. Also, the Italian will not seek huge money, which will keep the Manchester United hierarchy quite pleased too.\n\nFederico Chiesa.Carlos Rodrigues/Getty Images\n\nChiesa, 19, was one of the best players for the Serie A club last season, where they were below par as a unit.\n\nWith age on his side, no wonder, Chelsea are also looking to sign him, but with Manchester United in the mix as well, it could be interesting to see, who wins the race? It is his quality at such a young age, which seems to have caught the eye of both the Premier League clubs.\n\nOne should not be too surprised if the winger decides to stay put at Fiorentina, where he will be guaranteed more playing time.\n\nWith the transfer window to be shut later this month, there is a serious need for United to act soon as Mourinho might be left fuming if they fail to get the desired fourth signing.\n\nManchester United will play their first Premier League game against West Ham, and the manager will also understand other positions, which he needs to strengthen.

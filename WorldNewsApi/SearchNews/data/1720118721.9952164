{"id": 227505572, "title": "How Griffin Dunne\u2019s Dad Dominick Channeled Grief Over Daughter\u2019s Murder Into Famed Writing Career (Exclusive)", "text": "In the face of unspeakable tragedy, Griffin Dunne\u2019s father, Dominick, found his footing in a new career \u2014 crime journalism.Speaking with PEOPLE ahead of the publication of his new memoir, The Friday Afternoon Club: A Family Memoir, Griffin Dunne, 68, is looking back on his star-studded \u2014 and occasionally outrageous \u2014 life in Hollywood. The memoir, which details everything from the After Hours star\u2019s treasured friendship with Carrie Fisher to his acclaimed career in film and TV, is largely a family memoir, and examines his father Dominick's journey toward becoming a writer.Dominick was originally a Hollywood producer known for films like 1970\u2019s Boys in the Band and 1971\u2019s The Panic in Needle Park. While writing, Dunne recalled hardships that his father faced, such as his divorce from Dunne\u2019s mother, Ellen, when Dunne was 10, his struggles with alcohol and his closeted sexuality. \u201cBefore I wrote the book, I reached a place of empathy and love and respect for his bravery,\u201d Dunne says, adding that his father \u201chad wanted to become a writer for most of his life.\u201d Dominick authored several novels, including 1982\u2019s The Winners and 1985\u2019s The Two Mrs. Greenvilles, which was turned into a TV miniseries in 1987. In 1982, Dominick's daughter, Poltergeist actress Dominique, was strangled and killed by an ex-boyfriend when she was 22. Dominick kept a diary throughout the murder trial at the request of former Vanity Fair editor-in-chief Tina Brown, which he expanded into an in-depth article for the publication.\u201cHe wrote this devastating piece about what a family goes through, who had no experience in the court judicial system; what we went through,\u201d Dunne says. \u201cIt's a document that's like a handbook for what families should prepare for.\u201dIn the decades to follow, Dominick would cover several high-profile cases for Vanity Fair. He was one of two reporters granted full access to the O.J. Simpson trials in 1995, and was in the courtroom to cover the infamous trials of the Menendez brothers in 1993 and Phil Spector in 2007. His son, however, says that though Dominick was a journalist, he was \u201cnot a terribly unbiased one.\u201d \u201cIf he wrote about Phil Spector, he talked about Lana Clarkson and not as a third-rate actress, as the media continue to describe her,\u201d Dunne says. \u201cOr during O.J., he sat with the Browns and Nicole's family \u2026 he always looked at it from the rights of the victim.\u201dDominick also wasn\u2019t the only writer in the Dunne family. His younger brother was novelist and journalist John Gregory Dunne, and his sister-in-law was essayist and critic Joan Didion. Dunne recalls the fraught relationship between Dominick and John, which began in childhood. The brothers\u2019 father beat Dominick yet had a \u201cloving\u201d relationship with John, Dunne says, and the two only reconciled their differences in 2002, when they met in a cardiologist's office after the brothers each had heart attacks.\u201cI relived what it was like to be in the middle,\u201d Dunne says of looking back on their relationship. \u201cBecause I loved them both. And it was very toxic between these two men based on lifelong experiences that they saw differently.\u201d Despite the tension, Dunne says that turning to his family\u2019s work helped him to write The Friday Afternoon Club \u2014 though, he also has some regrets as the publication date approaches. \u201cIt's a book I really am sorry the three of them aren't around to have read,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they would've liked it. I sort of channeled their honesty. I admired the way that they, all of them ... were no strangers to sharing the personal, which is what I tried to do.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

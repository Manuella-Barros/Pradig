But that ratio has skewed sharply since the COVID-19 pandemic, with home prices up a whopping 47% since early 2020. Median home sales prices last year were about five times the median household income, according to tabulations in a newly released report by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, and there are signs it could get worse.\n\nThe double whammy of high prices and high mortgage rates has \"left homeownership out of reach to all but the most advantaged households,\" says Daniel McCue, a senior research associate at the center.\n\nThe report finds that in nearly half of metro areas, buyers must make more than $100,000 to afford a median-priced home; in 2021, that was the case in only 11% of markets.\n\nFor those looking to buy -- as well as for current homeowners -- rising property taxes and insurance rates are also adding to financial strain. According to Harvard's estimates, \"The all-in monthly costs of the median-priced home in the U.S. [when adjusted for inflation] are the highest since these data were first collected more than 30 years ago.\"\n\nThis has made it even harder to close racial gaps in homeownership. In the first quarter of 2024, the report finds that just 8% of Black renters and 13% of Hispanic renters had enough income to afford the monthly payments on a median-priced home.\n\nMeanwhile, with many homeowners reluctant to sell and give up their lower mortgage rates, home sales have plummeted. Last year saw the lowest level of existing-home sales in nearly three decades, even lower than after the 2008 housing crash. The U.S. homeownership rate nudged up just 0.1 percentage points last year, the smallest increase since 2016.\n\nThe housing crunch has also helped push up rental prices\n\nThe spike in home costs has left millions of people stuck renting, driving up competition and prices in that market too. For a record half of U.S. renters, their housing is now unaffordable, Harvard finds. Since 2001, inflation-adjusted rents have gone up 10 times faster than renters' income.\n\nHousing experts say the underlying problem for both buyers and renters is a massive housing shortage that has built up over decades and will take years to remedy. Single-family construction has been picking up, and some developers are building slightly smaller, lower-cost homes. A boom in multifamily construction has also helped ease rents, especially in places such as Austin, Texas, which saw some of the biggest hikes in recent years.\n\nBut the Harvard report's authors say this reprieve isn't likely to last.\n\nFor one thing, high interest rates and other rising costs -- land, labor, insurance -- have again slowed down apartment construction. And because all those things are so expensive, most of what's being built is at the higher end of the market. Over the past decade, the U.S. has lost more than 6 million units with rents under $1,000. For extremely low-income renters, the National Low Income Housing Coalition calculates that for every 100 households, there are only 34 places they can afford.\n\nAt the same time, rental demand remains strong, especially as more members of Generation Z move out on their own. Last year, the number of renter households grew by more than half a million, the biggest bump since 2016.\n\nIf demand continues to tick up while the slowdown in construction persists, the Harvard report warns that this will \"risk sparking another period of rapid rent increases similar to the recent run-up that has contributed to the worst renter affordability conditions on record.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 NPR", "source": {"uri": "tpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Texas Public Radio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner-occupancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Owner-occupancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Median income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Center_for_Housing_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint Center for Housing Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Median"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Low_Income_Housing_Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Low Income Housing Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real versus nominal value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/474ef34/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2810x1475+0+413/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F88%2Fc3%2Fe610451c4dbba0f6a88989fd77ab%2Frow-of-new-homes-under-construction-in-a-far-west-bexar-county-subdivision.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666626", "eventUri": "eng-9666626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

You'll need to earn over $100,000 | Houston Public Media", "body": "If you don't make more than $100,000 per year, you can't afford to buy a median-priced home in three of Texas' largest metro areas: Dallas-Fort Worth, greater Houston, and the Austin area.\n\nThat's one of several findings from a new Harvard University study of the nation's housing situation that shows huge swaths of the population -- renters and homeowners alike -- pay more for housing than they can afford.\n\nAccording to the State of Homelessness report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, more than 1 in 3 Texas households pay more than they can afford for housing. A quarter of homeowners and fully half of renters are considered cost burdened.\n\nMany pay more than half of their monthly earnings for housing: 1 in 10 Texas homeowner households and 1 in 4 Texas renter households.\n\n\"I think the big picture question with housing is, is over affordability. The lack of affordability specifically, is a big challenge for renters, for homeowners, for prospective owners,\" said Daniel McCue, a senior researcher at Harvard.\n\nWould-be homeowners face a market in Texas where home values have risen far faster than incomes.\n\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth, for example, the median home price was three times the median income in 2013. A decade later, the median home price was nearly five times the median income in the region.\n\nThis is part of a national trend, but the gap between earnings and home prices has grown faster than the national average in 15 of Texas' 25 largest urban areas over the past decade.\n\nThe Sherman-Denison area has seen sharpest affordability decline, and Bryan-College Station now has the largest gap between earnings and home prices. It now takes more than five times the median income to pay for the median-priced home.\n\nWith mortgage rates far higher than they've been in recent years, buying a home is simply impossible for a growing share of people. They're also paying more in rent, which makes it harder to save for a downpayment.\n\n\"Really the rug got pulled out of a lot of potential homeowners because interest rates just shot up and that affects how much your monthly payments will be on a home and it really knocked so many people out of the game for homeownership,\" McCue said.\n\nMcCue says many homeowners those who bought before home prices surged during the pandemic and have the benefit of a low interest rates on their home loan are struggling, especially those on a fixed in come or who were barely able to afford the home they bought.\n\n\"For those people on the margins, those other costs rising like the insurance payments and the property taxes that go up when your house value goes up, those things make a difference and they can be a pretty sizeable payment,\" McCue said.\n\nBut it's renters that face the greatest squeeze. Texas is experiencing a more profound version of a larger national trend: Low-cost rentals have been disappearing, and that's put pressure on low- and, increasingly, middle-income renters.\n\n\"We saw a drop of 6 million units renting for $1,000 or less [nationwide], and that's the rent you'd need to find in order to not be rent burdened and paying more than 30% of your income on rent,\" McCue said.\n\nShrinking affordability is only likely to compound the nation's inequities, McCue said. The nation has long had a huge gap in wealth, incomes and homeownership rates between Black and white families due to a long history of policies and practices that, intentionally or not, drove racial disparities.\n\nHomeownership has been a vehicle for creating and passing down generational wealth, he said. With homeownership to a smaller, more privileged share of the population, inequality is likely to compound.\n\nThere are some positive trends observed in the report, McCue said, including an increased focus on addressing affordability among policymakers. He points to efforts to shift policies so it's less expensive or challenging to build new and more affordable houses and apartments, and funding programs that help lower- or median-income people afford to their rent or become homeowners.\n\n\"Housing affordability is increasingly a priority issue, getting more attention at the state local and federal levels,\" he said. \"Momentum is building to address these problems.\"", "source": {"uri": "houstonpublicmedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Houston Public Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real estate appraisal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Center_for_Housing_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint Center for Housing Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater Houston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner-occupancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Owner-occupancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Down payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Homeowner_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Homeowner Associations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20081112/ap19143445804143-1500x1006.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666626", "eventUri": "eng-9666626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Low inventory, combined with rising prices, mortgage rates, homeowners insurance and other costs, can make homebuyers feel like they're running the gauntlet.\n\nTo understand how we got here, it's helpful to understand what housing affordability is, where it's been and where it's headed.\n\nOne of the most common standards used when measuring housing affordability is the 28/36 rule. This guideline states that you should spend no more than 28 percent of your income on housing costs, and no more than 36 percent of your income on all debt payments, including housing. Unfortunately, today's prices and mortgage rates make this rule too limiting for many would-be homebuyers, who might have to stretch their budget far beyond 28 percent to afford a house.\n\n\"I think of housing affordability as encompassing the broad spectrum of hurdles consumers must clear in order to purchase their home, such as debt-to-income ratio, credit, down payment and job stability,\" says Brad Seibel, president of Sage Home Loans. (Sage, like Bankrate, is part of Red Ventures.)\n\nSeibel explains that affordability is a combination of larger economic forces and your personal finances. \"As an example, a low interest rate helps the consumer's ability to meet debt-to-income ratios,\" he says. \"But at the same time, rising prices driven by those low interest rates increase the consumer's down payment requirements due to higher home purchase prices.\"\n\nIt's a balance you may have noticed at play in recent years. Historically low interest rates led to increased homebuying demand, which, paired with years of low inventory, drove up home prices. This rise in home prices greatly contributed to heightened inflation -- and the Federal Reserve then raising interest rates to fight it off.\n\nNow, the housing market has both higher prices and higher rates, which for many is reshaping the American Dream.\n\nThe way we buy and sell homes in the U.S. has changed dramatically over the last century. In fact, today's most popular tool for home financing, the 30-year mortgage, wasn't even approved by Congress until 1948 for new construction homes and even later -- 1954 -- for existing homes. Without these long-term mortgage loans, far fewer people would have access to homeownership.\n\nHere are a few other key pieces of legislation aimed at more affordable and equitable homeownership in the U.S.:\n\nSince these laws were enacted, the government has taken a multitude of varied steps to create affordable housing assistance. For instance, many state and local first-time homebuyer programs receive federal funding.\n\nWhen compared to the rise in home prices, wage growth in the U.S. has not come anywhere close to keeping up.\n\nIn 1964, the median household income was $6,569, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That same year, the typical home price was $18,925. That means the median income made up about a third of the typical home price.\n\nFast forward to 2022 (the most recent year for Census income data): The median household income was up to $74,580 -- more than 10 times what it was in 1964. That sounds like high growth, but not when you look at home prices: That same year, the typical home price was $432,950 -- more than 20 times higher than the typical home price in 1964. The median income made up around 34 percent of the home price in 1964, but by 2022, that had shrunk to just 17 percent.\n\nRising home prices are just part of the declining affordability puzzle. The next piece: interest rates.\n\nAs recently as 10 years ago, mortgage interest rates were much lower than they are now. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in 2014 was 4.3 percent, according to Bankrate's survey of the nation's largest lenders. Between 2014 and 2021, average mortgage rates fluctuated between 3.15 and 4.7 percent.\n\nRates then shot up in 2022 and 2023, due in large part to the Fed raising its key rate to combat inflation, with the average for 2023 being 7 percent even.\n\nWhen you combine the increase in home prices with the rise in interest rates using Bankrate's mortgage calculator, principal and interest mortgage payments more than doubled between 2014 and 2023 -- from $1,131 to $2,270, with 66 percent of that increase happening between 2021 and 2023.\n\nTo illustrate how home affordability has changed in different places over the past 10 years, we looked at 25 metropolitan areas based on population and geographic location. This breakdown uses the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index (now called the Cost of Housing Index), which is based on the percentage of homes sold in the area that would have been affordable to a family earning the local median income.\n\nAll 25 of these metros saw double-digit decreases in home affordability in the past 10 years. The five areas that saw the greatest decrease in affordability are:\n\nOf the metros that saw the smallest decrease in home affordability, three are in the Midwest (Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis) and two are on the East Coast (Philadelphia and Baltimore).\n\nAlong with buying a home, actually owning a home has gotten more expensive as well. For example:\n\nBuying a home isn't just more difficult than it was three or four years ago -- it's more difficult than it's been in a very long time. \"Now is one of the most difficult environments in my 30-plus years of finance to purchase a home,\" Seibel says. \"High interest rates coupled with low inventory and higher home prices after significant appreciation is squeezing the consumer from all sides.\"\n\nHomes don't seem poised to become much more affordable in the short term, either. From 1976 through 2023, homes appreciated at an average of 5 percent per year, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index. However, during 2021 and 2022, home prices grew by nearly 12 percent and 16 percent respectively. This was due largely to low rates and low inventory.\n\nHome sale prices are still on the rise in much of the country, but the rate is closer to the average rate of appreciation: The median national sale price in May 2024 was up just over 5 percent since last year, according to Redfin data.\n\nAlong with rising prices, the Federal Reserve seems determined to keep interest rates elevated until inflation settles to its 2 percent target. High rates and high prices are keeping the pressure on homebuyers.\n\nWith high mortgage rates and slowing sales, it's possible that price growth could slow, offering relief to homebuyers. And if inflation slows enough, the Fed will likely cut interest rates, which could help both buyers and sellers.\n\n\"I do think home affordability will improve in the near future,\" Seibel says. \"It's a function of the expected drop in interest rates and the recent flattening of the price appreciation in some markets.\"\n\nBut the crystal ball is cloudy. Home prices have yet to come down much, and rate cuts could be further off than expected -- in its June meeting, the central bank said they expect only one rate cut this year. Also, if mortgage rates drop enough, those who might be waiting for lower rates to buy could jump back into the market. That increased demand could drive up home prices further.\n\n\"The wildcard is [whether] lower rates trigger a resurgence in value appreciation,\" Seibel says. \"If that's the case, we will just be chasing our tail for an improvement in affordability.\"", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_dehan@bankrate.com", "name":

According to Harvard's estimates, \"The all-in monthly costs of the median-priced home in the U.S. [when adjusted for inflation] are the highest since these data were first collected more than 30 years ago.\"\n\nThis has made it even harder to close racial gaps in homeownership. In the first quarter of 2024, the report finds that just 8% of Black renters and 13% of Hispanic renters had enough income to afford the monthly payments on a median-priced home.\n\nMeanwhile, with many homeowners reluctant to sell and give up their lower mortgage rates, home sales have plummeted. Last year saw the lowest level of existing-home sales in nearly three decades, even lower than after the 2008 housing crash. The U.S. homeownership rate nudged up just 0.1 percentage points last year, the smallest increase since 2016.\n\nThe spike in home costs has left millions of people stuck renting, driving up competition and prices in that market too. For a record half of U.S. renters, their housing is now unaffordable, Harvard finds. Since 2001, inflation-adjusted rents have gone up 10 times faster than renters' income.\n\nHousing experts say the underlying problem for both buyers and renters is a massive housing shortage that has built up over decades and will take years to remedy. Single-family construction has been picking up, and some developers are building slightly smaller, lower-cost homes. A boom in multifamily construction has also helped ease rents, especially in places such as Austin, Texas, which saw some of the biggest hikes in recent years.\n\nBut the Harvard report's authors say this reprieve isn't likely to last.\n\nFor one thing, high interest rates and other rising costs -- land, labor, insurance -- have again slowed down apartment construction. And because all those things are so expensive, most of what's being built is at the higher end of the market. Over the past decade, the U.S. has lost more than 6 million units with rents under $1,000. For extremely low-income renters, the National Low Income Housing Coalition calculates that for every 100 households, there are only 34 places they can afford.\n\nAt the same time, rental demand remains strong, especially as more members of Generation Z move out on their own. Last year, the number of renter households grew by more than half a million, the biggest bump since 2016.\n\nIf demand continues to tick up while the slowdown in construction persists, the Harvard report warns that this will \"risk sparking another period of rapid rent increases similar to the recent run-up that has contributed to the worst renter affordability conditions on record.\"", "source": {"uri": "whyy.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHYY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner-occupancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Owner-occupancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real versus nominal value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Low_Income_Housing_Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Low Income Housing Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/12-1-2023-k-paynter-norristown-houses-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666626", "eventUri": "eng-9666626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

To comfortably afford a home, prospective buyers need to earn 80% more than they did just four years ago. Unfortunately, median incomes have increased by only 23% during the same period, exacerbating the affordability gap.\n\n\"Incomes needed to purchase a home are just much, much higher than the typical household income,\" said Orphe Divounguy, chief economist at Zillow. \"The increase in cost is pricing out many families that would like to get on the housing ladder.\"\n\nIn 2020, a household earning $59,000 per year could afford a typical home priced at about $240,815. That income level was below the U.S. median income of $66,000 at the time, meaning that more than half of American households could purchase a home without stretching their finances too thinly.\n\nToday, the scenario has drastically changed. To afford a median-priced home costing $342,941, buyers need an annual income of $106,000. That is $47,000 more than what was needed in 2020 and significantly higher than the current average income of $81,000.\n\nOver the past four years, escalating home values and mortgage rates have nearly doubled the monthly mortgage payment on a typical U.S. home. According to Zillow, today's average buyer faces a monthly mortgage payment that is 96% higher than in 2020. With a 10% down payment, that translates to an average monthly payment of $2,200.\n\nThe sharp increase can be attributed to the rise in mortgage rates, which hovered around 3.5% at the end of January 2020.

But affording a home for our family of three (plus our dog) is no longer a realistic goal. High home prices, expensive interest rates and a lack of homes for sale have locked out homebuyers across the US, particularly in high-cost markets like ours outside of Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nMy family earns a good living with a six-figure income, yet our location and budget make a new home purchase impossible. I've been reporting on real estate, banking and other personal finance topics over the last 10 years, and I was determined to do the math to figure out why a $100,000 income isn't enough to buy a home in today's housing market.\n\nEven though there's not much we can do to improve housing affordability on the macroeconomic level, there are steps you can take to make homebuying easier on your personal budget.\n\nToday's housing affordability crisis, together with the high cost of basic essentials, sluggish wage growth and increasing consumer debt, is widening the generational wealth gap. In a recent CNET survey, 93% of Americans said they're concerned about higher prices, and 27% of millennials are holding off on buying a home.\n\n\"Up until about 2020, a six-figure salary would make it relatively easy to afford a home,\" said Brian Mollo, CEO of Trusted House Buyers. \"However, in the past three or four years, the housing market has experienced some major changes.\"\n\nAccording to a report released in April by CNET's sister site Bankrate, you need to earn at least $110,871 per year to afford a median-priced home in the US, which is around $402,343.\n\nAverage housing costs and incomes are based on national data, but every local market is different. Figures for inventory, home prices, property taxes, homeowners insurance and salaries vary drastically across the country. Buyers need the highest incomes to afford homes in California, Hawaii, the District of Columbia, Washington and Massachusetts, according to Bankrate.\n\nIn my state of Massachusetts, you would need to earn at least $162,471 to comfortably afford a home. Technically, that means we should be able to buy a house now.\n\nAfter going over the numbers, I realized it's not that simple.\n\nThe typical selling price of a single-family home where I live is $599,950. Property taxes and homeowners insurance cost around $746 per month combined. If we made a 20% down payment and took out a home loan at a 7% interest rate, our monthly mortgage payment would be $3,939 -- a whopping 90% higher than the $2,070 we pay now (which includes principal, interest, property taxes, homeowners insurance and the HOA fee).\n\nOur budget can't support that, and finding the right house at that price isn't easy.\n\nMy husband and I routinely look through home listings online, and single-family houses priced at $600,000 in our market usually need some updating: The bathrooms and kitchens are straight out of the 1950s, the exterior siding needs a refresh or the floors need replacement. We'd be spending more than half a million dollars on a house knowing we'd have to sink tens of thousands of dollars more into it (not to mention time and energy) just to live there comfortably.\n\nPlus, 62% of homes in our area sell above their listing prices. So we'd probably have to stretch our budget even more to buy a home in less-than-stellar condition.\n\nHouses in our area that don't need major updates or renovations, also known as \"turnkey homes,\" usually go for around $750,000 or more. Assuming we got a 7% interest rate, made a 20% down payment and had to cover higher property taxes, the mortgage payment would be around $4,738, or one-third of our gross income. Utilities and maintenance are likely more expensive on these homes, too, so we'd need to adjust our budget accordingly.\n\nWith a household income of $187,000 and no other debts, a bank might approve my family for a home loan. Our budget contains some major line items that make such a large mortgage payment unrealistic.\n\nThat brings me to my next point.\n\nWe all pay for basic needs like groceries, utilities and housing costs, but budgets vary widely from one household to the next, and we all have different priorities.\n\nHere's where my family stands. After putting money aside for taxes, retirement contributions and college savings, we bring home $9,300 a month, which is then split into the following categories.\n\nA debt we recently paid off also impacts our current budget. Between 2016 and 2020, we cleared $150,000 in student loans by putting all our extra money toward the principal, which impacted our savings accounts. Now, we're making up for it by contributing more to retirement and our emergency fund each year.\n\nTechnically, we could lower some of our costs. For instance, we could put our daughter in a cheaper school and put less money into our savings to afford a larger home. Instead, we decided to prioritize retirement savings, our daughter's education and small splurges (like occasional vacations).\n\nOur lending profile, including our credit score, outstanding debts and monthly income, also impacts our home purchasing options.\n\nFor example, if you have a lower credit score, your mortgage lender might give you a higher interest rate on what you borrow, which lowers the amount you can spend on a home. If you have multiple debts, that increases your debt-to-income ratio, which also puts a dent in your housing budget.\n\nMy husband and I both have excellent credit and no debts aside from our housing payment. Because I'm self-employed, I often have to prove how much I earn and show that the income is consistent.\n\nOver the past seven years, my income has ranged from a low of $50,000 to a high of $150,000. That means my monthly earnings fluctuate between $4,200 and $12,500, making it difficult to plan for a large mortgage payment. My husband and I decided we weren't comfortable basing our housing budget on my variable income, so we qualified for the home loan based on his income alone.\n\nIf you think a home purchase would stretch your budget to the breaking point, you may decide to put off homebuying until mortgage rates improve and home prices go down. There are things you can do in the interim to feel more financially comfortable taking out a home loan in the near future:\n\nThere are some creative solutions you could try, too, according to Jeremy Schachter, branch manager with Fairway Independent Mortgage Corp. \"If you're a remote worker, maybe move to a lower-cost area,\" Schachter said.\n\nOr you could buy a home with a friend or relative to better afford the loan.\n\nMy husband and I don't regret buying a condo four years ago because we snagged a super-low interest rate on a home we like, but for now, we're hitting the pause button on a new home search until we feel more comfortable with our financial goals. It's OK to go that route, too.", "source": {"uri": "cnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNET"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kim_porter@cnet.com", "name": "Kim Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency":

This should come as no surprise as we're all contending with stubborn inflation, high borrowing costs, elevated home prices, and rising rents nationwide.\n\nEarlier this year, a Redfin survey asked U.S. homeowners and renters to rank issues from \"very important\" to \"not important at all\" as they relate to how they'll vote in the upcoming presidential election.\n\n\"Strength of the overall economy\" was the top issue, according to 89% of Millennials, 94% of Gen Xers, and 95% of Baby boomers. If you're of an older generation, you might relate. However, the younger generation feels differently.\n\nAn outstanding 91% of younger Gen Z Americans are most concerned with a more specific issue: housing affordability.\n\n\"Housing affordability is a cornerstone of this year's presidential election because even though the economy is fairly strong, unemployment is low and wages are rising, buying a home feels impossible for many Americans,\" explained Redfin senior economist Elijah de la Campa.\n\n\"This is particularly the case for young people, who have seen the cost of starter homes increase twice as fast as incomes. Young people care about other political issues, like immigration and abortion rights, but they're more likely to cite housing affordability as a factor in their vote because it directly impacts the roof over their head, their lifestyle and their ability to build wealth.\"\n\nConsumer prices rose 3.3% in May from the same time a year ago, which is down from the peak of about 9%, but still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The central bank has hiked interest rates in an attempt to bring prices back down and its policymakers project just one rate cut this year.\n\nThe Fed raising rates contributes to higher mortgage rates. In fact, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) recently reported that the monthly mortgage payment on a typical, existing single-family home with a 20% down payment was $2,037 in the first quarter. That's an incredible 9.3% increase from a year ago.\n\nBut higher mortgage rates haven't reduced demand and brought home prices down. Compared to one year ago, the national median single-family existing-home price climbed 5% to $389,400.\n\nRead more: Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now use $100 to cash in on prime real estate -- without the headache of being a landlord. Here's how\n\n\"Astonishingly, greater than 90% of the country's metro areas experienced home price growth despite facing the highest mortgage rates in two decades,\" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. \"In the current market, rising prices are the direct result of insufficient housing supply not meeting the full demand.\"\n\nIf you think you're off the hook as a renter, then think again. Rents across the U.S. have been rising at an average of 1.5 faster than wage growth since 2019, as per StreetEasy.\n\nYou might be wondering why housing affordability is hurting Gen Zers more than their older counterparts. Redfin says just over one-quarter (26.3%) of adult Gen Zers owned a home in 2023, little changed from 26.2% in 2022. Why? High mortgage interest rates coupled with no home equity to put toward a new home (like Gen Z's older counterparts have been able to do) have made matters exceedingly more difficult for them.\n\nIn March, President Biden announced a plan to lower housing costs for working families. His 2025 fiscal year budget includes $258 billion in housing investments to \"build or preserve over 2 million housing units.\"\n\nAmong several initiatives, it proposes a $10,000 middle-class mortgage relief tax credit to first time home buyers, a one-year tax credit of up to $10,000 to middle-class families who sell their starter home, and $25,000 in down payment assistance to first-generation homebuyers.\n\nMeanwhile, although Trump hasn't announced detailed plans, his reelection is seen as a move toward the privatization of government-sponsored entities (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nTo add, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters from California recently sponsored the Strengthening Housing Supply Act of 2024. If passed, the bill will allow for the use of the Community Development Block Grant, which is federal assistance to state and local governments to support neighborhood and housing development, to pay for the construction of new affordable housing across the U.S.\n\nIt's clear that housing affordability is no joke in today's America and the issue will certainly be a key factor when voters head to the polls this November.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

You'll need to earn over $100,000", "body": "If you don't make more than $100,000 per year, you can't afford to buy a median-priced home in three of Texas' largest metro areas: Dallas-Fort Worth, greater Houston, and the Austin area.\n\nThat's one of several findings from a new Harvard University study of the nation's housing situation that shows huge swaths of the population -- renters and homeowners alike -- pay more for housing than they can afford.\n\nAccording to the State of Homelessness report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, more than 1 in 3 Texas households pay more than they can afford for housing. A quarter of homeowners and fully half of renters are considered cost burdened.\n\nMany pay more than half of their monthly earnings for housing: 1 in 10 Texas homeowner households and 1 in 4 Texas renter households.\n\n\"I think the big picture question with housing is, is over affordability. The lack of affordability specifically, is a big challenge for renters, for homeowners, for prospective owners,\" said Daniel McCue, a senior researcher at Harvard.\n\nWould-be homeowners face a market in Texas where home values have risen far faster than incomes.\n\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth, for example, the median home price was three times the median income in 2013. A decade later, the median home price was nearly five times the median income in the region.\n\nThis is part of a national trend, but the gap between earnings and home prices has grown faster than the national average in 15 of Texas' 25 largest urban areas over the past decade.\n\nThe Sherman-Denison area has seen sharpest affordability decline, and Bryan-College Station now has the largest gap between earnings and home prices. It now takes more than five times the median income to pay for the median-priced home.\n\nWith mortgage rates far higher than they've been in recent years, buying a home is simply impossible for a growing share of people. They're also paying more in rent, which makes it harder to save for a downpayment.\n\n\"Really the rug got pulled out of a lot of potential homeowners because interest rates just shot up and that affects how much your monthly payments will be on a home and it really knocked so many people out of the game for homeownership,\" McCue said.\n\nMcCue says many homeowners those who bought before home prices surged during the pandemic and have the benefit of a low interest rates on their home loan are struggling, especially those on a fixed in come or who were barely able to afford the home they bought.\n\n\"For those people on the margins, those other costs rising like the insurance payments and the property taxes that go up when your house value goes up, those things make a difference and they can be a pretty sizeable payment,\" McCue said.\n\nBut it's renters that face the greatest squeeze. Texas is experiencing a more profound version of a larger national trend: Low-cost rentals have been disappearing, and that's put pressure on low- and, increasingly, middle-income renters.\n\n\"We saw a drop of 6 million units renting for $1,000 or less [nationwide], and that's the rent you'd need to find in order to not be rent burdened and paying more than 30% of your income on rent,\" McCue said.\n\nShrinking affordability is only likely to compound the nation's inequities, McCue said. The nation has long had a huge gap in wealth, incomes and homeownership rates between Black and white families due to a long history of policies and practices that, intentionally or not, drove racial disparities.\n\nHomeownership has been a vehicle for creating and passing down generational wealth, he said. With homeownership to a smaller, more privileged share of the population, inequality is likely to compound.\n\nThere are some positive trends observed in the report, McCue said, including an increased focus on addressing affordability among policymakers. He points to efforts to shift policies so it's less expensive or challenging to build new and more affordable houses and apartments, and funding programs that help lower- or median-income people afford to their rent or become homeowners.\n\n\"Housing affordability is increasingly a priority issue, getting more attention at the state local and federal levels,\" he said. \"Momentum is building to address these problems.\"\n\nGot a tip?

According to Harvard's estimates, \"The all-in monthly costs of the median-priced home in the U.S. [when adjusted for inflation] are the highest since these data were first collected more than 30 years ago.\"\n\nThis has made it even harder to close racial gaps in homeownership. In the first quarter of 2024, the report finds that just 8% of Black renters and 13% of Hispanic renters had enough income to afford the monthly payments on a median-priced home.\n\nMeanwhile, with many homeowners reluctant to sell and give up their lower mortgage rates, home sales have plummeted. Last year saw the lowest level of existing-home sales in nearly three decades, even lower than after the 2008 housing crash. The U.S. homeownership rate nudged up just 0.1 percentage points last year, the smallest increase since 2016.\n\nThe spike in home costs has left millions of people stuck renting, driving up competition and prices in that market too. For a record half of U.S. renters, their housing is now unaffordable, Harvard finds. Since 2001, inflation-adjusted rents have gone up 10 times faster than renters' income.\n\nHousing experts say the underlying problem for both buyers and renters is a massive housing shortage that has built up over decades and will take years to remedy. Single-family construction has been picking up, and some developers are building slightly smaller, lower-cost homes. A boom in multifamily construction has also helped ease rents, especially in places such as Austin, Texas, which saw some of the biggest hikes in recent years.\n\nBut the Harvard report's authors say this reprieve isn't likely to last.\n\nFor one thing, high interest rates and other rising costs -- land, labor, insurance -- have again slowed down apartment construction. And because all those things are so expensive, most of what's being built is at the higher end of the market. Over the past decade, the U.S. has lost more than 6 million units with rents under $1,000. For extremely low-income renters, the National Low Income Housing Coalition calculates that for every 100 households, there are only 34 places they can afford.\n\nAt the same time, rental demand remains strong, especially as more members of Generation Z move out on their own. Last year, the number of renter households grew by more than half a million, the biggest bump since 2016.\n\nIf demand continues to tick up while the slowdown in construction persists, the Harvard report warns that this will \"risk sparking another period of rapid rent increases similar to the recent run-up that has contributed to the worst renter affordability conditions on record.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_ludden@npr.org", "name": "Jennifer Ludden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "daniel_wood@npr.org", "name": "Daniel Wood", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner-occupancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Owner-occupancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Median income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Center_for_Housing_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint Center for Housing Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Median"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Low_Income_Housing_Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Low Income Housing Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real versus nominal value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2138x1203+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2F19%2F24f2b34d491a90f419b2f054c737%2Fscreenshot-2024-06-18-at-4-32-36-pm.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666626", "eventUri": "eng-9666626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

In order to afford a median-priced home in the first quarter of 2024, a household needed to earn $120,000 per year -- up from $82,000 three years ago, adjusted for inflation.\n\n\"Faced with rising homeownership costs, fewer renters can afford to transition to homeownership,\" the report said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nOnly 14.5% of rental households nationwide had enough income to afford a median-priced home in the first quarter of 2024, according to the report.\n\nRent prices have also increased, rising 26% since 2020, although rent growth has slowed significantly since 2022.\n\nCities where home prices have soared to at least eight times the median household income include Boulder, Colorado; Santa Fe, New Mexico; Flagstaff, Arizona; Corvallis, Oregon; and much of coastal California, according to the university's interactive map.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "audrey_baker@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Audrey Baker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner-occupancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Owner-occupancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Median income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Center_for_Housing_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint Center for Housing Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvallis,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corvallis, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Corvallis, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Fe, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flagstaff, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Flagstaff, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Housing-lot-22Sold22-sign-in-Arlington-Heights-Illinois.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666626", "eventUri": "eng-9666626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.\n\nEasing interest rates are one bright spot in a housing market that remains extremely challenging, especially for first-time home buyers. A report released today by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) highlights these difficulties -- rising home prices, meager inventory, inadequate affordable housing construction -- while also illustrating benefits and potential pitfalls of homeownership in the United States.\n\nHomeownership bolsters wealth, but unequally\n\nThere are plenty of reasons homeownership appeals to many people, but a big one is the opportunity to build wealth. Generally, the longer you own your home, the more home equity you have -- your home's current value minus the amount left on your mortgage is the equity, or how much of the home is truly yours. When home values increase, equity grows.\n\nHome equity helps explain why homeowning households have much greater wealth than renter households. Wealth is the market value of assets owned minus debts. Home prices rose 42% from 2019 to 2022, according to the National Association of Realtors, widening an existing wealth gap. The JCHS report finds that in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available, median homeowner household wealth was $396,500, while renter wealth was less than 3 percent of that total, at $10,400.\n\nHomeowners have not benefited equally from these gains, however. Looking at homeowner household wealth by race, the effects of systemic racism and discriminatory practices like redlining are apparent. The JCHS analysis notes that in 2022, Black homeowner households' median wealth was less than half that of white homeowner households, at $202,200 compared to $442,200.\n\nMore homeowners struggle with costs More from this section NYPD identify 2 Bronx men shot in the chest, face in Manhattan King, Murphy punch tickets to Paris as Ledecky wins again New report warns of heat danger at Paris Olympics\n\nRising home prices lift home equity, but they also make homeownership more costly. For new homeowners, mortgage payments are higher. But even for existing homeowners, costs can go up, as cities and towns reassess values and raise property taxes. Along with dramatic increases in homeowners' insurance costs, these factors are creating more cost-burdened households, the JCHS report underscores.\n\nA cost-burdened household spends 30 percent or more of its income on housing-related costs, including rent, mortgage payments or utilities. JCHS finds that in 2022, 23% of homeowner households fit the definition of cost burdened. Homeowner households earning less than $30,000 annually make up a substantial portion of this group, as do homeowners age 65 and older.\n\nThese groups may have access to funds via equity. But to use that money, the homeowner has to sell, refinance or borrow against the equity. That may not be appealing, particularly for homeowners who would be unable to move to an affordable home or whose mortgage payments would jump at current mortgage interest rates.\n\nFor those dreaming of homeownership, the data suggests the importance of budgeting inclusively, taking into consideration both the one-time costs of homebuying and the recurring expenses you'll face as a homeowner. Finding a home that will fit your budget is the first step toward successful homeownership.\n\nMore From NerdWallet\n\nCompare Current Mortgage RatesHow to Build Generational WealthBudgeting to Avoid Becoming House Poor\n\nThe article Weekly Mortgage Rates Trend Lower; Report Reveals Housing Strain originally appeared on NerdWallet.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner-occupancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Owner-occupancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annual percentage rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NerdWallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NerdWallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redlining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Realtors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Realtors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institutional racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Homeowner_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Homeowner Associations", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reformer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/20/12012bc2-daee-5c58-ba0d-8e9ea178249a/6674914e22bca.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666626", "eventUri": "eng-9666626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Home prices are high, rents are high, and people are feeling the pain. We're seeing that in the number of cost-burdened households, defined as those who spend more than 30% of their income on housing.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2022, the number of cost-burdened homeowners rose by 3 million, to a total of 19.7 million. That means nearly one in four homeowner households \"are now stretched worryingly thin,\" the report states, of which, 27.4% are ages 65 and up. More concerning, it was households that earned less than $30,000 a year that \"constituted over half of the growth in cost-burdened homeowners from 2019 to 2022.\" Not to mention, 9 million homeowners are severely cost-burdened, defined as those spending more than half of their income on housing.\n\n\"For renters, the landscape is even more challenging,\" the report read. \"While rents have been rising faster than incomes for decades, the pandemic-era rent surge produced an unprecedented affordability crisis.\"\n\nHalf of all renter households were considered cost-burdened in 2022; 22.4 million renters, the highest on record. And the number of severely cost-burdened renter households hit an all-time high of 12.1 million in the same year. The number of cost-burdened renters is up 2 million from 2019, and the number of severely cost-burdened renters is up 1.5 million.\n\nHome prices are 47% higher than they were in early 2020, despite declining briefly at the beginning of last year -- and rents are still 26% higher, despite some softening in the rental market. And let's not forget mortgage rates, which reached a more than two-decade high last year, and despite coming down some, are still substantially higher than the pandemic's historic lows. \"The low interest rates that helped shield homebuyers from rapidly rising home prices have disappeared ... Consequently, homeownership is less affordable than it has been in decades,\" the report read.\n\nA recent uptick in the supply of multifamily homes is behind some of that softening we're seeing in rents, but apartment construction has already begun to plummet, so it's not clear how long that slight bit of relief will last. There aren't enough existing homes in the for-sale housing world, to boot. And in some parts of the country, it's hard to build new homes because of zoning and broad land-use regulations. So it's no secret that \"homeownership is increasingly out of reach,\" as the report suggests.\n\nHigher prices squeeze households\n\n\"To afford such a high payment under common payment-to-income ratios, a borrower would need an annual income of at least $119,800, a threshold just one in seven (6.6 million) of the nation's 45 million renter households can meet,\" the report says. \"It now takes an annual household income of at least $100,000 to afford the median-priced home in nearly half of all metro areas.\"\n\nSo only 6.6 million renters, which equates to 14.5%, had the necessary income to afford a median-priced home in the first quarter of this year. That's down from 7.7 million early last year and 10.2 million in 2022. If you were to include a 3.5% down payment and 3% closing costs, only 2.6 million renters could afford a median-priced home, so 5.8%.\n\nThe homeownership rate across all ages across the country only increased 0.1% last year, the smallest increase since 2016 (the same year a post-Great Recession low was reached). The number of unhoused individuals has risen, too. As of last year, 653,100 people were experiencing homelessness, an all-time high, according to the report.\n\nLiterally, millions of people are priced out of homeownership and are cost-burdened, and it doesn't seem as though much will change. \"Looking forward, housing costs are likely to remain high,\" the report read. \"On the for-sale side, home prices are set to rise in the face of highly constrained supply, prolonging this unusually difficult market for first-time homebuyers.\" And the for-rent space might see more softening, but \"subdued rent growth will not last long.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.\n\nEasing interest rates are one bright spot in a housing market that remains extremely challenging, especially for first-time home buyers. A report released today by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) highlights these difficulties -- rising home prices, meager inventory, inadequate affordable housing construction -- while also illustrating benefits and potential pitfalls of homeownership in the United States.\n\nHomeownership bolsters wealth, but unequally\n\nThere are plenty of reasons homeownership appeals to many people, but a big one is the opportunity to build wealth. Generally, the longer you own your home, the more home equity you have -- your home's current value minus the amount left on your mortgage is the equity, or how much of the home is truly yours. When home values increase, equity grows.\n\nHome equity helps explain why homeowning households have much greater wealth than renter households. Wealth is the market value of assets owned minus debts. Home prices rose 42% from 2019 to 2022, according to the National Association of Realtors, widening an existing wealth gap. The JCHS report finds that in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available, median homeowner household wealth was $396,500, while renter wealth was less than 3 percent of that total, at $10,400.\n\nHomeowners have not benefited equally from these gains, however. Looking at homeowner household wealth by race, the effects of systemic racism and discriminatory practices like redlining are apparent. The JCHS analysis notes that in 2022, Black homeowner households' median wealth was less than half that of white homeowner households, at $202,200 compared to $442,200.\n\nMore homeowners struggle with costs\n\nRising home prices lift home equity, but they also make homeownership more costly. For new homeowners, mortgage payments are higher. But even for existing homeowners, costs can go up, as cities and towns reassess values and raise property taxes. Along with dramatic increases in homeowners' insurance costs, these factors are creating more cost-burdened households, the JCHS report underscores.\n\nA cost-burdened household spends 30 percent or more of its income on housing-related costs, including rent, mortgage payments or utilities. JCHS finds that in 2022, 23% of homeowner households fit the definition of cost burdened. Homeowner households earning less than $30,000 annually make up a substantial portion of this group, as do homeowners age 65 and older.\n\nThese groups may have access to funds via equity. But to use that money, the homeowner has to sell, refinance or borrow against the equity. That may not be appealing, particularly for homeowners who would be unable to move to an affordable home or whose mortgage payments would jump at current mortgage interest rates.\n\nFor those dreaming of homeownership, the data suggests the importance of budgeting inclusively, taking into consideration both the one-time costs of homebuying and the recurring expenses you'll face as a homeowner. Finding a home that will fit your budget is the first step toward successful homeownership.\n\nThe article Weekly Mortgage Rates Trend Lower; Report Reveals Housing Strain originally appeared on NerdWallet.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "source": {"uri": "nasdaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NASDAQ Stock Market"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner-occupancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Owner-occupancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annual percentage rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NerdWallet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NerdWallet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Redlining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Realtors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Realtors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institutional racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Homeowner_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Homeowner Associations", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/nerd_wallet/GettyImages-1400232071-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666626", "eventUri": "eng-9666626", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

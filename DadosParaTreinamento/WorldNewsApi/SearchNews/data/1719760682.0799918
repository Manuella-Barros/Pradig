The winger joined Derek McInnes\u2019 side in December of last year and played ten times in the second half of the season, scoring once. Killie manager McInnes believes the former Dundee United, Aberdeen, Hearts, Celtic and New York attacker can bring useful experience and ability as he looks to build on last season\u2019s fourth-placed finish and get through Europa Conference League qualifying. McInnes has recently signed a new deal of his own, and tied down homegrown striker Innes Cameron on a new deal. Talks are ongoing with a number of other first team players. A club statement read: \u201cGary Mackay-Steven has committed his future to Kilmarnock as he has signed a new contract that will keep him here until 2025, pending approval. \u201cThe tricky attacker has agreed to a new deal at Rugby Park, and his wealth of experience will prove vital in the build-up to our European matches.\u201d", "summary": "The experienced winger will remain at Rugby Park for another twelve months.", "url": "https://news.stv.tv/sport/gary-mackay-steven-signs-new-one-year-deal-with-kilmarnock-ahead-of-european-qualifiers", "image": "https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/0e5bded0556dcec2d6271b90aac7ca70-1716984654.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:35:43", "author": "Andy Coyle", "authors": ["Andy Coyle"], "language": "en", "source_country": "tv", "sentiment": 0.525}

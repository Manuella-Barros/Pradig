It is always present. Its methods evolve. While government has ways to address it, it is likely impossible to eradicate. That said, it must be discouraged, and its effects must be mitigated.\"\n\nUnder a federal protocol ushered in by the Liberals in 2019, there would be a public announcement if a panel of bureaucrats determined that an incident -- or an accumulation of incidents -- threatened Canada's ability to have a free and fair election.\n\nThere was no such announcement concerning either the 2019 or 2021 general elections. In both ballots, the Liberals were returned to government with minority mandates while the Conservatives formed the official Opposition.\n\nHogue said she cannot exclude the possibility that the outcome in some individual ridings could have been affected by foreign interference. \"However, in my view, the number of ridings at issue is relatively small, and the ultimate effects of foreign interference remain uncertain.\"\n\nHogue singled out two examples that came up repeatedly during the public hearings.\n\nShe scrutinized the 2019 Liberal nomination race in the Toronto riding of Don Valley North where Han Dong won the candidacy.\n\nThe Canadian Security Intelligence Service flagged a potential plot involving a busload of Chinese international students with falsified documents, but Hogue said there wasn't enough evidence to inform any conclusions about what actually happened.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Dong said he appreciated Hogue's hard work and that her report had vindicated him. \"I am not a 'witting affiliate' of Chinese foreign interference networks,\" he said.\n\nHogue also pointed to the 2021 results in British Columbia's Steveston-Richmond East, finding a \"reasonable possibility\" a potential Chinese interference campaign against Conservative candidate Kenny Chiu cost him the seat.\n\nOverall, Hogue concluded that foreign interference \"likely impacted some votes\" in the 2019 and 2021 general elections, and more broadly undermined the right of voters to have an electoral ecosystem free from coercion or covert influence.\n\n\"This impact has likely been slight to date, but may become more severe in the future.\"\n\nThe risk of politicians modifying their positions or messages because of foreign interference will increase \"if we do not take sufficient protective measures to guard against it,\" Hogue wrote.\n\n\"This outcome would be very detrimental to the functioning of our democracy, as it would undermine the fundamental principle that politicians must be free to express their opinions, and those of their constituents, without fear and without covert influence from a foreign state.\"\n\nConservative MP Michael Chong called Hogue's report \"a damning set of conclusions\" that contradicts \"much of what the government has told us\" over the last year-and-a-half.\n\nAlthough Hogue's main findings about the two most recent elections are reassuring for Canadians, her warnings for the future are very clear, said New Democrat MP Peter Julian. \"So we need to prepare, we need to make sure as a country that we are ready.\"\n\nJulian said the government should act now to create a registry of foreign agents to help detect undue influence on Canadian affairs.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Friday the work of the commission will support the government's ability to adapt measures against interference. He reiterated plans to present legislation in coming days to bolster the federal toolkit.\n\nThe bill is likely to include changes to existing laws, such as the CSIS Act, to make it easier for authorities to crack down on meddling, as well as the establishment of a foreign agent registry.\n\nThe ongoing inquiry will next shift to broader policy issues, looking later this year at the government's ability to detect, deter and counter foreign interference.\n\nIn her interim report, Hogue said the evidence to date does not demonstrate \"bad faith on anyone's part, or that information was deliberately and improperly withheld, but it does suggest that on some occasions, information related to foreign interference did not reach its intended recipient, while on others the information was not properly understood by those who received it.\"\n\n\"These are serious issues that need to be investigated and considered.\"\n\nAttempts to meddle in Canadian affairs have long been a reality, prompting stark intelligence warnings as early as the 1980s about Beijing's efforts to influence and exploit the Chinese diaspora.\n\nIn February of last year, the Globe and Mail, quoting classified CSIS records, said China worked to help ensure a Liberal minority victory in the 2021 election as well as defeat Conservative politicians considered unfriendly to Beijing.\n\nThe next month, the federal government announced that an independent rapporteur would look into foreign interference, one of several measures to counter meddling and strengthen confidence in the electoral process.\n\nFormer governor general David Johnston, who took on the task, said in a May 2023 report there were \"serious shortcomings\" in the way intelligence is communicated and processed from security agencies through to government.\n\nHowever, he found no examples of ministers, the prime minister or their offices knowingly or negligently failing to act on intelligence, advice or recommendations.\n\nJohnston said several leaked materials that raised legitimate questions were misconstrued in some media reports, presumably because of a lack of context.\n\nFinally, he recommended against a public inquiry, saying a commissioner would encounter the same obstacles of secrecy that marked his work.\n\nAmid additional leaks to the media and pressure from opposition parties, however, the government announced in September that Hogue would lead a public inquiry.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 3, 2024.\n\nJim Bronskill and Laura Osman, The Canadian

impacted some votes\" in the 2019 and 2021 general elections, and more broadly undermined the right of voters to have an electoral ecosystem free from coercion or covert influence.\n\n\"This impact has likely been slight to date, but may become more severe in the future.\"\n\nThe risk of politicians modifying their positions or messages because of foreign interference will increase \"if we do not take sufficient protective measures to guard against it,\" Hogue wrote.\n\n\"This outcome would be very detrimental to the functioning of our democracy, as it would undermine the fundamental principle that politicians must be free to express their opinions, and those of their constituents, without fear and without covert influence from a foreign state.\"\n\nThe ongoing inquiry will next shift to broader policy issues, looking at the government's ability to detect, deter and counter foreign interference.\n\nAttempts to meddle in Canadian affairs have long been a reality, prompting stark intelligence warnings as early as the 1980s about Beijing's efforts to influence and exploit the Chinese diaspora.\n\nIn February of last year, the Globe and Mail, quoting classified CSIS records, said China worked to help ensure a Liberal minority victory in the 2021 election as well as defeat Conservative politicians considered unfriendly to Beijing.\n\nThe next month, the federal government announced that an independent rapporteur would look into foreign interference, one of several measures to counter meddling and strengthen confidence in the electoral process.\n\nFormer governor general David Johnston, who took on the task, said in a May 2023 report there were \"serious shortcomings\" in the way intelligence is communicated and processed from security agencies through to government.\n\nHowever, he found no examples of ministers, the prime minister or their offices knowingly or negligently failing to act on intelligence, advice or recommendations.\n\nJohnston said several leaked materials that raised legitimate questions were misconstrued in some media reports, presumably because of a lack of context.\n\nFinally, he recommended against a public inquiry, saying a commissioner would encounter the same obstacles of secrecy that marked his work.\n\nAmid additional leaks to the media and pressure from opposition parties, however, the government announced in September that Hogue would lead a public inquiry.\n\nBy Jim Bronskill and Laura Osman.", "source": {"uri": "cheknews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CHEK"}, "authors":

I also learned that the government takes measures to try and respond to it, whether or not an election is underway,\" Hogue wrote.\n\n\"In this way, foreign interference is like crime. It is always present. Its methods evolve. While government has ways to address it, it is likely impossible to eradicate. That said, it must be discouraged, and its effects must be mitigated.\"\n\nUnder a federal protocol ushered in by the Liberals in 2019, there would be a public announcement if a panel of bureaucrats determined that an incident -- or an accumulation of incidents -- threatened Canada's ability to have a free and fair election.\n\nThere was no such announcement concerning either the 2019 or 2021 general elections. In both ballots, the Liberals were returned to government with minority mandates while the Conservatives formed the official Opposition.\n\nHogue said she cannot exclude the possibility that the outcome in some individual ridings could have been affected by foreign interference. \"However, in my view, the number of ridings at issue is relatively small, and the ultimate effects of foreign interference remain uncertain.\"\n\nHogue singled out two examples that came up repeatedly during the public hearings.\n\nShe scrutinized the 2019 Liberal nomination race in the Toronto riding of Don Valley North where Han Dong won the candidacy.\n\nThe Canadian Security Intelligence Service flagged a potential plot involving a busload of Chinese international students with falsified documents, but Hogue said there wasn't enough evidence to inform any conclusions about what actually happened.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Dong said he appreciated Hogue's hard work and that her report had vindicated him. \"I am not a 'witting affiliate' of Chinese foreign interference networks,\" he said.\n\nHogue also pointed to the 2021 results in British Columbia's Steveston-Richmond East, finding a \"reasonable possibility\" a potential Chinese interference campaign against Conservative candidate Kenny Chiu cost him the seat.\n\nOverall, Hogue concluded that foreign interference \"likely impacted some votes\" in the 2019 and 2021 general elections, and more broadly undermined the right of voters to have an electoral ecosystem free from coercion or covert influence.\n\n\"This impact has likely been slight to date, but may become more severe in the future.\"\n\nThe risk of politicians modifying their positions or messages because of foreign interference will increase \"if we do not take sufficient protective measures to guard against it,\" Hogue wrote.\n\n\"This outcome would be very detrimental to the functioning of our democracy, as it would undermine the fundamental principle that politicians must be free to express their opinions, and those of their constituents, without fear and without covert influence from a foreign state.\"\n\nConservative MP Michael Chong called Hogue's report \"a damning set of conclusions\" that contradicts \"much of what the government has told us\" over the last year-and-a-half.\n\nAlthough Hogue's main findings about the two most recent elections are reassuring for Canadians, her warnings for the future are very clear, said New Democrat MP Peter Julian. \"So we need to prepare, we need to make sure as a country that we are ready.\"\n\nJulian said the government should act now to create a registry of foreign agents to help detect undue influence on Canadian affairs.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Friday the work of the commission will support the government's ability to adapt measures against interference. He reiterated plans to present legislation in coming days to bolster the federal toolkit.\n\nThe bill is likely to include changes to existing laws, such as the CSIS Act, to make it easier for authorities to crack down on meddling, as well as the establishment of a foreign agent registry.\n\nThe ongoing inquiry will next shift to broader policy issues, looking later this year at the government's ability to detect, deter and counter foreign interference.\n\nIn her interim report, Hogue said the evidence to date does not demonstrate \"bad faith on anyone's part, or that information was deliberately and improperly withheld, but it does suggest that on some occasions, information related to foreign interference did not reach its intended recipient, while on others the information was not properly understood by those who received it.\"\n\n\"These are serious issues that need to be investigated and considered.\"\n\nAttempts to meddle in Canadian affairs have long been a reality,

But in a subsequent statement, she appeared to go a step further.\n\n\"There is one riding where disinformation may have led to the election of one candidate over another,\" said Hogue, who did not take questions Friday.\n\n\"But I cannot say for sure.\"\n\nMisleading information about Chiu and former Conservative leader Erin O'Toole appeared in media outlets and social media sites with ties to Beijing, painting them as anti-China and trying to dissuade Chinese Canadians from voting for them.\n\nThe actual impact of that campaign on the final vote is \"difficult to determine,\" Hogue found.\n\n\"In Canada, how someone votes is secret. It is therefore not possible to directly link the misleading media narratives with how any given voter cast their ballot,\" the report said.\n\n\"And even if I were to assume that some votes were changed, there is no way to know whether enough votes were changed to affect the result.\"\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said last month that several intelligence and security agencies found \"not a single riding\" was impacted or changed as a result of foreign interference.\n\nConservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said Hogue's report doesn't support what Trudeau told the public.\n\n\"This report is a damning set of conclusions and findings in the first phase of this inquiry, about what the Trudeau government has indicated over the last 18 months and contradicts much of what the government has told us over that period of time,\" Chong said Friday.\n\nO'Toole testified during the inquiry's public hearings that he believed the misinformation may have cost him as many as nine seats in the 2021 election.\n\nThat was not enough to change the overall results -- the Liberals won 160 seats to the Conservatives' 119 -- but O'Toole said he thinks wins in those ridings would have allowed him to stay on as leader. He was ousted by the Conservative caucus in February, less than five months after the election.\n\nHogue said the evidence she has seen doesn't allow her to make any conclusions about the wider impact of the interference.\n\n\"I do not mean to minimize the legitimate concerns of those who raised these issues. My findings are limited to the evidence before me,\" she said.\n\nThe commission also scrutinized a 2019 Liberal nomination battle in the Toronto-area riding of Don Valley North, where Han Dong won the candidacy.\n\nThe Canadian Security and Intelligence Service flagged a potential plot involving a busload of Chinese international students with falsified documents provided by a proxy agent.\n\nHogue said there wasn't enough evidence to draw any conclusions about what actually happened, nor was it in the commission's mandate to do so.\n\n\"However, this incident makes clear the extent to which nomination contests can be gateways for foreign states who wish to interfere in our democratic processes,\" she said.\n\nThe criteria for voting in a nomination race, which is decided by political parties, does not seem very stringent and neither do the control measures, she added. That is something Hogue plans to examine further in the next phase of the inquiry.\n\nDong went on to win the seat in the 2019 election, but left the Liberal party last year to sit as an independent MP when the allegations came to light.\n\nThe commission also heard evidence about a phone call between Dong and a Chinese consular official in which they discussed the arbitrary detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China. The pair were imprisoned in December 2018 in what is widely seen to be retaliation for Canada's role in detaining Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days earlier.\n\nMedia reports based on leaked intelligence alleged that Dong advocated against their release in that conversation with the consular official, something Dong has denied.\n\n\"As I said from the beginning, I did not advocate for the delayed release of the Two Michaels and I am not a 'witting affiliate' of Chinese foreign interference networks,\" Dong said in a statement Friday.\n\nA summary of the intelligence released by the inquiry suggest Dong advised the Chinese official that even if the \"Two Michaels\" were released, opposition parties would view it as affirmation that a hard line approach to the People's Republic of China was effective.\n\nHogue did not make any mention of that conversation in her interim report.", "source": {"uri": "stettlerindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Stettler

But in a subsequent statement, she appeared to go a step further.\n\n\"There is one riding where disinformation may have led to the election of one candidate over another,\" said Hogue, who did not take questions Friday.\n\n\"But I cannot say for sure.\"\n\nMisleading information about Chiu and former Conservative leader Erin O'Toole appeared in media outlets and social media sites with ties to Beijing, painting them as anti-China and trying to dissuade Chinese Canadians from voting for them.\n\nThe actual impact of that campaign on the final vote is \"difficult to determine,\" Hogue found.\n\n\"In Canada, how someone votes is secret. It is therefore not possible to directly link the misleading media narratives with how any given voter cast their ballot,\" the report said.\n\n\"And even if I were to assume that some votes were changed, there is no way to know whether enough votes were changed to affect the result.\"\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said last month that several intelligence and security agencies found \"not a single riding\" was impacted or changed as a result of foreign interference.\n\nConservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said Hogue's report doesn't support what Trudeau told the public.\n\n\"This report is a damning set of conclusions and findings in the first phase of this inquiry, about what the Trudeau government has indicated over the last 18 months and contradicts much of what the government has told us over that period of time,\" Chong said Friday.\n\nO'Toole testified during the inquiry's public hearings that he believed the misinformation may have cost him as many as nine seats in the 2021 election.\n\nThat was not enough to change the overall results -- the Liberals won 160 seats to the Conservatives' 119 -- but O'Toole said he thinks wins in those ridings would have allowed him to stay on as leader. He was ousted by the Conservative caucus in February, less than five months after the election.\n\nHogue said the evidence she has seen doesn't allow her to make any conclusions about the wider impact of the interference.\n\n\"I do not mean to minimize the legitimate concerns of those who raised these issues. My findings are limited to the evidence before me,\" she said.\n\nThe commission also scrutinized a 2019 Liberal nomination battle in the Toronto-area riding of Don Valley North, where Han Dong won the candidacy.\n\nThe Canadian Security and Intelligence Service flagged a potential plot involving a busload of Chinese international students with falsified documents provided by a proxy agent.\n\nHogue said there wasn't enough evidence to draw any conclusions about what actually happened, nor was it in the commission's mandate to do so.\n\n\"However, this incident makes clear the extent to which nomination contests can be gateways for foreign states who wish to interfere in our democratic processes,\" she said.\n\nThe criteria for voting in a nomination race, which is decided by political parties, does not seem very stringent and neither do the control measures, she added. That is something Hogue plans to examine further in the next phase of the inquiry.\n\nDong went on to win the seat in the 2019 election, but left the Liberal party last year to sit as an independent MP when the allegations came to light.\n\nThe commission also heard evidence about a phone call between Dong and a Chinese consular official in which they discussed the arbitrary detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China. The pair were imprisoned in December 2018 in what is widely seen to be retaliation for Canada's role in detaining Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days earlier.\n\nMedia reports based on leaked intelligence alleged that Dong advocated against their release in that conversation with the consular official, something Dong has denied.\n\nA summary of the intelligence released by the inquiry suggest Dong advised the Chinese official that even if the \"Two Michaels\" were released, opposition parties would view it as affirmation that a hard line approach to the People's Republic of China was effective.\n\nHogue did not make any mention of that conversation in her interim report.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 3, 2024.\n\nLaura Osman, The Canadian Press",

Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue's initial report seems to at least cast significant doubt on that claim.\n\n\"In my opinion, the evidence I have heard to date does not demonstrate bad faith on anyone's part, or that information was deliberately and improperly withheld,\" Hogue says at page 150.\n\nHogue repeated her finding about an absence of bad faith in her prepared remarks to reporters on Friday. But in both cases, she attached a caveat.\n\nThe evidence, she wrote, \"does suggest that on some occasions, information related to foreign interference did not reach its intended recipient, while on others the information was not properly understood by those who received it.\"\n\nIn her remarks, she said \"there were some communication problems and a certain lack of understanding of the role that everyone plays, or should play, in combating foreign interference.\"\n\nThese are far less sensational problems. But they're still problems.\n\nIn assessing the impact of foreign interference during the 2019 and 2021 elections, Hogue states clearly and unequivocally that she does not believe any meddling undermined the integrity of the electoral system or affected which party formed government. It could have affected the result in a specific riding, she says, although she also concedes that she cannot say so with certainty.\n\nBut she does find that foreign interference has now undermined public confidence in Canadian democracy.\n\n\"While awareness and foreign interference may at one time have been largely within the domain of security and intelligence agencies and hidden from public view, the cat is now out of the proverbial bag,\" Hogue writes. \"The result has been to shake the confidence of Canadians in their electoral processes.\"\n\n\"Ironically,\" she adds, \"I note that undermining faith in democracy and government is a primary aim of many of the states that engage in foreign interference.\"\n\nWhich is why it's most unfortunate that this report is only coming out now -- and not eight months or a year earlier.\n\nIn its own defence, the Liberal government can fairly argue that it established new bodies and formal processes to deal with foreign interference -- a threat that fully came into view in the wake of the American presidential election in 2016.\n\nWithin the apparatus of government and federal elections, there now exists the SITE task force, the Critical Election Incident Public Protocol and the Rapid Response Mechanism (a veritable alphabet of new acronyms to learn).\n\n(There is also the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, the body that, if cooler heads had prevailed, might have been the right forum to address the allegations raised by media reports in 2022 and 2023.)\n\nHogue's inquiry has illuminated those mechanisms and raised useful questions about how well they work, how they can be improved and under what parameters they should operate. Some of the problems she raises might have simple fixes. But repeatedly, Hogue found issues that will require further consideration as her inquiry continues.\n\nHogue empathized with Kenny Chiu, the former Conservative MP, whose re-election campaign was the subject of \"erroneous information\" that spread online.\n\n\"It is not obvious what help the government could or should have provided at the time,\" she writes. \"But it raises an important question about when and how government should intervene to respond to online misinformation and disinformation.\"\n\nHogue notes that government officials could not definitively attribute online misinformation about Chiu or the Conservative Party to a state actor. But she notes that such attribution is inherently difficult. And that raises further questions.\n\n\"If we cannot expect Canada's security and intelligence community to attribute online activity to foreign countries with certainty, are we setting the bar too high by requiring certain attribution before the government intervenes?\" Hogue asks. \"Or are there good reasons to practice restraint, even if there will rarely be a direct response to disinformation like what Mr. Chiu faced?\"\n\nHogue finds that a later response by the SITE task force to Conservative officials was \"unnecessarily confusing.\"\n\n\"It would be helpful if government agencies making such assessments would use words that clearly convey their position,\" Hogue writes -- advice that can be fairly applied to all levels and manners of modern government communication.\n\nMore broadly, there remains the scourge of excessive reticence. CSIS, Hogue writes at one point, can be \"circumspect with details when informing others of the intelligence it has gathered and the conclusions it has drawn.\"\n\nIf the Liberals can be happy that Hogue did not find bad faith, they still face the challenge of responding to such issues and concerns before the next federal election.\n\nIn the wake of allegations about how former Liberal MP Han Dong won the party's nomination in Don Valley North, Hogue also questions whether the Liberal nomination process is stringent enough. And she notes that it's unclear what, if anything, was done within the government to follow up on those allegations after the 2019 election.\n\nIn her preface, Hogue writes that, \"The following pages are about our democracy, our values and what can threaten them. That is why this report concerns us all.\"\n\nNearly a year ago, when he issued his own report into sensational allegations of foreign interference, former governor general David Johnston said \"democracy is challenged. And my heavens, if any country in the world should be making democracy work, it's this country, Canada. And that's what we must get about.\"\n\nThe original leaker(s) might take solace from the fact that the blaring headlines ultimately led to greater public awareness and a detailed exploration of both the problem of foreign interference and how the federal government is responding to it.\n\nBut it also remains fair to conclude that no one has covered themselves in glory over the past 18 months -- that it took too long to get to Friday's report and there are no heroes in the story of how Canadian politics got here. If public confidence has been shaken, it's not just because of the allegations of foreign interference. It's also because of how those allegations were handled and framed.\n\nWith her initial hearings and first report -- a second report that looks more deeply at the issues is due later this year -- Hogue has at least laid the foundation for a real conversation about the threat, assuming that political actors are still interested in such a conversation.\n\nRegardless, the end result might be an improved approach to foreign interference and a more resilient democracy.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The bad news is there were many attempts to interfere, candidates and Canadians were affected, and it might well have influenced who was elected to Parliament from a couple of ridings. And the danger will probably become more pervasive.\n\nUnderneath the top line, there were many things to worry about in Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue's first, tight-deadline report on foreign interference.\n\nThe People's Republic of China was by far the biggest threat, but there were efforts by India, and others. And while it was not enough to taint whole elections, she flagged many concerns about the parts.\n\nShe suggested the rules for Liberal Party nominations might be open to interference, that the process for alerting the public about foreign misinformation might be too slow to act and not concerned enough about the impact. And that CSIS might be so secretive it doesn't share what others need to know.\n\nThere were two conflicting things at play: A wake-up call on the dangers of foreign interference, and a concern that fears might be taken too far, and that the public might think, wrongly, that their democratic system is rigged.\n\nInstead, Justice Hogue's report describes foreign actors - China, mainly - chipping away at pieces of Canada's democracy. But those pieces matter. And they add up.\n\n\"It is likely to increase and have negative consequences for our democracy unless vigorous measures are taken to detect it and better counter it,\" Justice Hogue wrote.\n\nThat's the conclusion worth following here. Canadians - voters, candidates, constituents - feel real effects. Diaspora communities feel intimidated. There is a risk politicians alter their messages out of fear of foreign governments. And this is a growing danger.\n\nAll that is so, even though the Commissioner said she couldn't conclude whether the result of any individual riding race was altered by foreign interference. What Justice Hogue did provide was a tale of two ridings where that might have already happened.\n\nOne was the 2021 case of Kenny Chiu, then the MP for the B.C. riding of Steveston-Richmond East, who faced a whirlwind of stories circulating online stating that he and the Conservative Party were anti-China, and that his proposal for a foreign-agents registry would require Chinese-Canadians to register.\n\nA guide to foreign interference and China's suspected influence in Canada\n\nThe panel of five senior bureaucrats charged with deciding whether to alert the public about foreign interference decided not to say anything because it wasn't clear if Beijing was behind it, and Mr. Chiu publicly denied the claims - but Justice Hogue suggested that's not good enough.\n\nThe other was the 2019 Liberal nomination of Han Dong - now sitting as an Independent - in the riding of Don Valley North. There were intelligence reports that suggested that Chinese officials might have arranged for a busload of foreign students to vote for Mr. Dong. Justice Hogue noted that it might have determined the nomination race, and who won the seat.\n\n\"Given that Don Valley North was considered a 'safe' Liberal seat, if foreign interference did impact the nomination race, this would likely not have affected which party held the riding,\" she wrote. \"It would, however, have affected who was elected to Parliament. This is significant.\"\n\nMr. Trudeau, as Liberal Leader, chose not to remove Mr. Dong as the party's candidate, and the Prime Minister testified at the inquiry that he did not feel the inconclusive intelligence reports were enough to overturn a nomination election.\n\nYet Ms. Hogue noted, pointedly, that Mr. Trudeau testified he realized in 2019 he would have to follow up on the allegations after the election, but it's not clear where that went. \"The specifics of any follow-up are at this point unclear, and I am not certain what steps were taken,\" she wrote.\n\nBut that's a rare assessment of the Prime Minister's actions. What's missing from this report is a detailed judgment on the actions of the political leadership - on who knew what, when, whether warnings were ignored, or who dropped the ball. Maybe there will be more of that in Justice Hogue's final report, on broader issues of foreign interference, due in December.\n\nIn the meantime, she has set the onus on the government to act, to take steps to counter foreign interference that has already chipped at pieces of Canada's democracy, before it grows.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Security Intelligence Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Chiu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Chiu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steveston\u2014Richmond_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steveston\u2014Richmond East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Valley_North", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Don Valley North"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Dong_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Han Dong (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/P3BOBIXMIVCOJCAOLEDXWMQXWU.jpg?auth=434cb05adc62d6d1a9593c850b33d2579bd4e46099040b659f83f2b2c2000ba7&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537828", "eventUri": "eng-9537828", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Commissioner Justice Marie-Josee Hogue listens to a lawyer speak during the Public Inquiry Into Foreign Interference in Federal Electoral Processes and Democratic Institutions, in Ottawa, Thursday, March 28, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian WyldOTTAWA - Foreign meddling attempts didn't change who won the last two federal elections in Canada, but may have changed the result in one riding in 2021, a public inquiry concluded Friday. A preliminary report by commissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue said the extent of the impact of foreign interference is unknown, though the number of races involved is small. \"The ultimate effects of foreign interference remain uncertain,\" she said in her interim report. She singled out the 2021 results in the British Columbia riding of Steveston - Richmond East, where she said there is a \"reasonable possibility\" that a foreign interference campaign targeting Conservative candidate Kenny Chiu may have cost him the seat. In her report, Hogue wrote that the campaign \"could have impacted the result\" in Chiu's riding in 2021. But in a subsequent statement, she appeared to go a step further. \"There is one riding where disinformation may have led to the election of one candidate over another,\" said Hogue, who did not take questions Friday. \"But I cannot say for sure.\" Misleading information about Chiu and former Conservative leader Erin O'Toole appeared in media outlets and social media sites with ties to Beijing, painting them as anti-China and trying to dissuade Chinese Canadians from voting for them. The actual impact of that campaign on the final vote is \"difficult to determine,\" Hogue found. \"In Canada, how someone votes is secret. It is therefore not possible to directly link the misleading media narratives with how any given voter cast their ballot,\" the report said. \"And even if I were to assume that some votes were changed, there is no way to know whether enough votes were changed to affect the result.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last month that several intelligence and security agencies found \"not a single riding\" was impacted or changed as a result of foreign interference. Conservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said Hogue's report doesn't support what Trudeau told the public. \"This report is a damning set of conclusions and findings in the first phase of this inquiry, about what the Trudeau government has indicated over the last 18 months and contradicts much of what the government has told us over that period of time,\" Chong said Friday. O'Toole testified during the inquiry's public hearings that he believed the misinformation may have cost him as many as nine seats in the 2021 election. That was not enough to change the overall results - the Liberals won 160 seats to the Conservatives' 119 - but O'Toole said he thinks wins in those ridings would have allowed him to stay on as leader. He was ousted by the Conservative caucus in February, less than five months after the election. Hogue said the evidence she has seen doesn't allow her to make any conclusions about the wider impact of the interference. \"I do not mean to minimize the legitimate concerns of those who raised these issues. My findings are limited to the evidence before me,\" she said. The commission also scrutinized a 2019 Liberal nomination battle in the Toronto-area riding of Don Valley North, where Han Dong won the candidacy. The Canadian Security and Intelligence Service flagged a potential plot involving a busload of Chinese international students with falsified documents provided by a proxy agent. Hogue said there wasn't enough evidence to draw any conclusions about what actually happened, nor was it in the commission's mandate to do so. \"However, this incident makes clear the extent to which nomination contests can be gateways for foreign states who wish to interfere in our democratic processes,\" she said. The criteria for voting in a nomination race, which is decided by political parties, does not seem very stringent and neither do the control measures, she added. That is something Hogue plans to examine further in the next phase of the inquiry. Dong went on to win the seat in the 2019 election, but left the Liberal party last year to sit as an independent MP when the allegations came to light. The commission also heard evidence about a phone call between Dong and a Chinese consular official in which they discussed the arbitrary detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China. The pair were imprisoned in December 2018 in what is widely seen to be retaliation for Canada's role in detaining Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days earlier. Media reports based on leaked intelligence alleged that Dong advocated against their release in that conversation with the consular official, something Dong has denied. A summary of the intelligence released by the inquiry suggest Dong advised the Chinese official that even if the \"Two Michaels\" were released, opposition parties would view it as affirmation that a hard line approach to the People's Republic of China was effective. Hogue did not make any mention of that conversation in her interim report.

There have been arguments made that the threshold should be lowered for future races.\n\nIn Friday's report, Hogue notes that \"as soon as the impact of foreign interference is known, there is a loss of trust in our democracy.\" She said the federal government was right to set a high threshold for sounding alarm bells, mindful to not \"serve a foreign state's goal to sow discord and discredit democracy.\"\n\nAt the same time, Hogue says that people are right to be worried and want officials to \"shine a light\" on what is going on.\n\n\"This paradox is one of the issues I will look at in the next stage of my work,\" she said.\n\nHow to counter disinformation\n\nUsing the example of former Conservative MP Kenny Chiu, whose 2021 campaign was impacted by Chinese efforts to defeat Conservatives, Hogue says how governments can address instances of foreign disinformation during elections, needs more consideration.\n\nHogue is of the view that the government \"appeared to require a very high certainty that foreign states were responsible for online activity,\" but she's concerned that officials put too much stock in politicians' public statements countering false narratives cleansing \"the information ecosystem.\"\n\n\"By the time that disinformation fades away, it may be too late. The damage to the democratic process may already be done. The fact that the narratives... had died down by election day does not mean that they had no effect.\"\n\nThe next phase of the commission \"must\" examine this, she said.\n\nHow intelligence is communicated, shared\n\nA fourth concept that Hogue wants to dig further into is whether national security and intelligence agencies should say more than they have in the past about various attempts or threats they're tracking.\n\nThis includes the question of how intelligence and information about foreign interference should be communicated within government, to the public, and to those vulnerable to its effects.\n\n\"In my opinion, the evidence I have heard to date does not demonstrate bad faith on anyone's part, or that information was deliberately and improperly withheld,\" Hogue said.\n\n\"But it does suggest that on some occasions, information related to foreign interference did not reach its intended recipient, while on others the information was not properly understood by those who received it,\" she said. \"These are serious issues that need to be investigated and considered.\"\n\nShe said that revealing only general information - as clearly has been the case in certain high-profile examples of meddling concerns - \"risks obscuring the importance of what is being communicated, thereby reducing the likelihood that those receiving the information will internalize and act on it.\"\n\nAttributing interference to a state\n\nLastly, the commissioner said that more contemplation and consideration is needed around how Canada decides to name the foreign states behind various interference attempts.\n\n\"The evidence I have heard is that attributing electoral interference to foreign state actors can be extremely challenging, especially with the sophisticated online tools and tactics now available, and the use of proxies and co-optees,\" she said.\n\nLook for questions to be raised in the next phase aimed at illuminating how and when federal officials determine they have what they need to confidently name and blame another country for meddling.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Peruvian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021 Peruvian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Dong_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Han Dong (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public inquiry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Chiu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Chiu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Writ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/5/3/marie-josee-hogue-1-6872692-1714762332977.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537828", "eventUri": "eng-9537828", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"The ultimate effects of foreign interference remain uncertain,\" she said in her interim report.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nShe singled out the 2021 results in the British Columbia riding of Steveston -- Richmond East, where she said there is a \"reasonable possibility\" that a foreign interference campaign targeting Conservative candidate Kenny Chiu may have cost him the seat.\n\nIn her report, Hogue wrote that the campaign \"could have impacted the result\" in Chiu's riding in 2021. But in a subsequent statement, she appeared to go a step further.\n\n\"There is one riding where disinformation may have led to the election of one candidate over another,\" said Hogue, who did not take questions Friday.\n\n\"But I cannot say for sure.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMisleading information about Chiu and former Conservative leader Erin O'Toole appeared in media outlets and social media sites with ties to Beijing, painting them as anti-China and trying to dissuade Chinese Canadians from voting for them.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe actual impact of that campaign on the final vote is \"difficult to determine,\" Hogue found.\n\n\"In Canada, how someone votes is secret. It is therefore not possible to directly link the misleading media narratives with how any given voter cast their ballot,\" the report said.\n\n\"And even if I were to assume that some votes were changed, there is no way to know whether enough votes were changed to affect the result.\"\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said last month that several intelligence and security agencies found \"not a single riding\" was impacted or changed as a result of foreign interference.\n\nConservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong said Hogue's report doesn't support what Trudeau told the public.\n\n\"This report is a damning set of conclusions and findings in the first phase of this inquiry, about what the Trudeau government has indicated over the last 18 months and contradicts much of what the government has told us over that period of time,\" Chong said Friday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nO'Toole testified during the inquiry's public hearings that he believed the misinformation may have cost him as many as nine seats in the 2021 election.\n\nThat was not enough to change the overall results -- the Liberals won 160 seats to the Conservatives' 119 -- but O'Toole said he thinks wins in those ridings would have allowed him to stay on as leader. He was ousted by the Conservative caucus in February, less than five months after the election.\n\nHogue said the evidence she has seen doesn't allow her to make any conclusions about the wider impact of the interference.\n\n\"I do not mean to minimize the legitimate concerns of those who raised these issues. My findings are limited to the evidence before me,\" she said.\n\nThe commission also scrutinized a 2019 Liberal nomination battle in the Toronto-area riding of Don Valley North, where Han Dong won the candidacy.\n\nThe Canadian Security and Intelligence Service flagged a potential plot involving a busload of Chinese international students with falsified documents provided by a proxy agent.\n\nHogue said there wasn't enough evidence to draw any conclusions about what actually happened, nor was it in the commission's mandate to do so.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"However, this incident makes clear the extent to which nomination contests can be gateways for foreign states who wish to interfere in our democratic processes,\" she said.\n\nThe criteria for voting in a nomination race, which is decided by political parties, does not seem very stringent and neither do the control measures, she added. That is something Hogue plans to examine further in the next phase of the inquiry.\n\nDong went on to win the seat in the 2019 election, but left the Liberal party last year to sit as an independent MP when the allegations came to light.\n\nThe commission also heard evidence about a phone call between Dong and a Chinese consular official in which they discussed the arbitrary detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in China. The pair were imprisoned in December 2018 in what is widely seen to be retaliation for Canada's role in detaining Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou days earlier.\n\nMedia reports based on leaked intelligence alleged that Dong advocated against their release in that conversation with the consular official, something Dong has denied.\n\nA summary of the intelligence released by the inquiry suggest Dong advised the Chinese official that even if the \"Two Michaels\" were released, opposition parties would view it as affirmation that a hard line approach to the People's Republic of China was effective.\n\nHogue did not make any mention of that conversation in her interim report.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 3, 2024.",

But already, Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue has gone further than the earlier effort by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's hand-picked special rapporteur, David Johnston.\n\nIn light of Justice Hogue's findings, it's clear that Mr. Johnston's report amounted to a coverup, or at the very least an attempt to smother the controversy over China's meddling in the 2019 and 2021 elections by taking aim, not at the government, but at the media and those who bravely chose to expose Beijing's efforts by leaking classified information.\n\nJustice Hogue has eschewed such nonsense. Instead, her first report delivers insights into what transpired in the 2019 and 2021 elections and raises serious questions about how intelligence officials and other senior bureaucrats responded to the threats posed by China's malevolent actions.\n\nForeign interference a 'stain' on Canada's electoral process, Hogue inquiry concludes\n\nHer analysis sweeps away the smokescreen that the Liberals have attempted to cast around key issues in the debate over foreign interference by China. The biggest such diversion was the Liberal line that, sure, foreign interference is a problem, but it's a longstanding one, and a number of other state actors also pose a threat.\n\nThe initial report demolishes that notion, underscoring that China \"stands out as the most persistent and sophisticated foreign interference threat to Canada,\" and that the resources it devoted outstripped those of any other state.\n\nThe Liberals have also continually pointed to the idea that the meddling did not affect which party formed government in the 2021 election as a way of implying that foreign interference had no effect at all. Mr. Trudeau went so far as to say that no riding results were affected, and that former Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole's concerns that China's efforts cost his party up to nine seats was a case of sour grapes.\n\nThe report punctures that rhetoric. Justice Hogue concludes that the ultimate result was not changed. But she goes on to say there is a \"reasonable possibility\" that results in Steveston-Richmond East in British Columbia were impacted, and that it is possible that a small number of other ridings were affected. She praises Mr. O'Toole and the Conservatives for not calling into question the overall election results.\n\nEven more crucially, Justice Hogue acknowledges two hard truths: foreign interference undermined \"the right of voters to have an electoral ecosystem free from coercion or covert influence\"; and, as a result, Canadians' confidence in our democracy has been eroded. \"This is perhaps the greatest harm Canada has suffered as a result of foreign interference,\" she writes.\n\nIn remarks accompanying the report, she called foreign interference \"a stain on our electoral process.\"\n\nFive takeaways from the foreign-interference commission's report\n\nThe report is an important moment of clarity. The media are not to blame for the damage to Canada's democracy, nor are the leakers of classified information, as the Liberals and Mr. Johnston attempted to assert. China is.\n\nBut Justice Hogue's efforts are, at best, a decent start; she has yet to deal with the biggest questions surrounding Canada's response. With one important exception, she hasn't determined what the Prime Minister knew, when he knew it, and what he did about it.\n\nThose questions are the heart of the matter. For more than a year, it's been clear that China took steps to meddle in Canadian elections. More details are helpful, bolstered by sworn testimony, of course. Policy recommendations, eventually, will also be helpful. Neither of those, however, will result in accountability for the government for its actions, or inaction, to combat China's electoral-interference campaign.\n\nThere is a hint of what, one hopes, may be coming in Justice Hogue's second report in her recounting of how Mr. Trudeau reacted when told about allegations that China had meddled in the nomination race for Don Valley North, to the benefit of Han Dong, at that point the Liberal candidate in the 2019 election. Mr. Trudeau testified that he planned to \"revisit\" the matter after the election. \"However, the specifics of any follow-up are at this point unclear, and I am not certain what steps were taken,\" she writes.\n\nIn that case, at least, the answer to the three questions is: Mr. Trudeau knew about allegations of Chinese interference before the 2019 vote - and there is no evidence at hand that he did anything at all that would harm the interests of the Liberal Party.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_O'Toole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erin O'Toole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_special_rapporteur", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations special rapporteur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public inquiry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Johnston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steveston\u2014Richmond_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steveston\u2014Richmond East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberals_(Sweden)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberals (Sweden)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elections in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Valley_North", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Don Valley North"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Dong_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Han Dong (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/I7NTV2BQQFDWXGQTZLIXBU5SBY.jpg?auth=a700a728250b1000073ddab22149bcc87a80dd9e98c9e337877fb91504b1619a&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537828", "eventUri": "eng-9537828", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

(Photo courtesy of video stream from the Foreign Interference Commission)\n\nInterference from China may have helped elect Liberal candidate Han Dong in suburban Toronto and defeat incumbent Kenny Chiu, a Conservative in suburban Vancouver. Dong is currently an independent Member of Parliament.\n\nSpeaking in Ottawa, Hogue said this has left a mark on Canada's election process.\n\n'Nonetheless, the acts of interference that occurred. Some of these acts have been established - while others remain only suspected - are a stain on our electoral process. And in fact, the process leading up to the actual vote,' Hogue said.\n\nIn releasing the interim report, Hogue said it is impossible to determine if this interference affected the number of votes for each candidate.\n\nFormer Conservative Member of Parliament Kenny Chiu. (Photo courtesy Canadian House of Commons)\n\nDong was born in Shanghai. Critics say he's spoken favorably about the People's Republic of China, while Chiu, born in then-British-controlled Hong Kong, has spoken against Beijing.\n\nIn an interview with VOA, Chiu said he was encouraged that Hogue, who is a judge in Quebec, found a reasonable possibility his election defeat in 2021 could have been the result of Chinese interference.\n\nHowever, he said Hogue and the commission need more time.\n\n'Overall, I'm still fairly, skeptic, skeptical to the... to the effort because I, in my personal opinion, I don't think there has been enough time given to Judge Hogue to do a proper job,' he said.\n\nHogue said in the future, Canada must be careful not to stigmatize different ethnic groups targeted by interference.\n\n'We must also avoid taking measures that will stigmatize some of our fellow citizens, particularly those from the diasporas,' Hogue said. \"But all that makes it that much more difficult to fight foreign interference, which is generally, but not exclusively, the work of authoritarian regimes. To a certain extent, it is an uneven battle.'\n\nIn her report, Hogue said the impact was minimal but may become more severe. She thinks the chance of politicians modifying their platforms due to foreign pressure may happen if sufficient safeguards are not implemented.\n\nHogue said the report has a classified supplement that does not alter her findings and reinforces some of them.\n\nShe said this report is not definitive, but she does not think the main conclusions will change in the coming stages of the inquiry.\n\nThe next stage focuses on the Canadian government's ability to detect, prevent and counter any future foreign interference.\n\nThe inquiry will launch an outreach program, examining different ethnic groups in Canada, to get their views and experiences on any foreign interference.", "source": {"uri": "cambodiantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cambodian Times"}, "authors":

Chaired by Commissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue, the inquiry reviewed thousands of documents and heard over 60 witnesses during 21 days of hearings to determine the extent and impact of foreign interference.\n\nThe report concludes that while foreign interference was present during the last two federal elections, it did not alter the final election results or which party formed the government. The integrity of the electoral outcomes was maintained, although interference did affect public perception and the electoral process itself. Despite no alteration in the electoral outcomes, the report identifies significant concerns about the integrity of pre-vote processes.\n\nCommissioner Hogue emphasized that the inquiry had unrestricted access to all relevant documents, including those classified for national security. The inquiry identified lapses in communication within the government's handling of interference alerts but found no evidence of malicious intent.\n\nThe report includes a thorough examination of incidents where foreign interference was evident. For instance, it discusses the potential foreign influence in the 2019 Liberal nomination contest in Don Valley North, where there were strong indications of foreign activities aimed at influencing the nomination process. The inquiry could not conclusively determine the impact of these activities on the election result in the riding, but noted their potential significance.\n\nAdditionally, the report addresses misinformation campaigns and their effects on public trust. It notes that foreign actors utilized misinformation to influence public opinion, particularly targeting diaspora communities to sway their political views and participation.\n\nMoving forward, the inquiry will enter its second stage, which will assess the capabilities of federal departments and agencies in responding to foreign interference. This stage will also include public outreach, particularly to diaspora communities, to collect broader experiences and insights on foreign interference. The inquiry plans to hold public hearings in the fall to discuss these findings further.\n\nThe inquiry's ongoing efforts aim to bolster Canada's defenses against foreign interference in future elections, with a comprehensive final report due by December 31, 2024.

Those include:\n\nAll of these instances were concerning, Hogue concludes in her report, even though they did not change which party took power in both 2019 and 2021. That is not to say the foreign interference operations had no impact, however.\n\n\"Interference occurred in the last two general elections, and indeed continues to occur frequently. It is likely to increase and have negative consequences for our democracy unless vigorous measures are taken to detect and better counter it,\" Hogue wrote.\n\n\"In my view, the events named in this report likely diminished the ability of some voters to cast an informed vote, thereby tainting the process.\"\n\nHogue's report was months in the making after more than a year of the Liberal government resisting calls for an inquiry into foreign interference in the first place.\n\nOver two months, the Hogue inquiry heard from more than 70 witnesses - including politicians, senior public servants and security officials, diaspora groups and political staff. It also grappled with a significant amount of now-declassified documents and summaries of CSIS intelligence.\n\nDespite the significant amount of material and the gravity of the threat, Hogue was under a tight timeline to deliver Friday's interim report.\n\nHogue was upfront with the limitations of her findings - she wasn't able to test the information provided by intelligence agencies or question their conclusions, for instance. The inquiry was also not able to reconcile the at times contradictory testimony from different witnesses, or to conclusively name individuals believed to be behind foreign interference operations.\n\nEven with those caveats, Hogue's findings are the most conclusive look at the allegations of foreign interference in the 2019 and 2021 elections first reported by Global News and the Globe and Mail.\n\nThe PRC is seen to be the \"main perpetrator\" of foreign interference in Canadian democracy \"by a large margin,\" according to the report. Broadly speaking, Beijing is agnostic about which party leads Canada, but seeks to aid candidates seen as \"pro-China.\"\n\n\"Foreign interference by the PRC is generally thought to be party-agnostic. The PRC does not support any particular party, but rather supports outcomes that it views as pro-PRC, regardless of the political affiliation of a particular candidate,\" the report read.\n\nOne alleged PRC activity was meddling in the 2019 Liberal nomination in Don Valley North, first reported by Global News. Han Dong, now sitting as an independent MP after stepping down from Liberal caucus, has denied any knowledge about the alleged regularities.\n\n\"Before the (2019) election, intelligence reporting, though not firmly substantiated, indicated that Chinese international students would have been bused in to the nomination process in support of Han Dong, and that individuals associated with a known PRC proxy agent provided students with falsified documents to allow them to vote, despite not being residents of (Don Valley North),\" the report reads.\n\nThe report noted that the information came from a variety of sources and had \"various levels of corroboration.\"\n\n\"After the election, some intelligence indicated that veiled threats were issued by the PRC consulate to the students, implying that their student visas would be in jeopardy and that there could be consequences for their families living in the PRC if they did not support Mr. Dong.\"\n\nDong has denied any involvement in the alleged irregularities, the report noted.\n\nIn his testimony at the Hogue inquiry, Dong said that if he was made aware of international students improperly voting in his nomination, he would have put a stop to it.\n\n\"I didn't pay attention to busing international students because ... I didn't understand it as an irregularity,\" he said.\n\nDong's campaign manager, Ted Lojko, testified that he, too, knew nothing about the busload of students.\n\nCSIS brought the allegations of irregularities to the attention of Jeremy Broadhurst, a senior Liberal campaign official, who in turn briefed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the intelligence in September 2019. Both Broadhurst and Trudeau concluded there was not enough evidence to suggest Dong should be removed as the Liberals' candidate in Don Valley North.\n\nGlobal News published a story about irregularities in the nomination in February 2023, citing unnamed national security sources.\n\nIn response, Trudeau defended Dong and attributed the allegations to racism.\n\n\"One of the things we've seen, unfortunately, over the past years is a rise in anti-Asian racism linked to the pandemic, and concerns being arisen around people's loyalties,\" Trudeau said in February 2023, more than three years after being briefed on potential PRC-related irregularities in Dong's primary race.\n\nBut Hogue noted that the incident - and the PRC's alleged involvement - point to a larger problem with federal nominations, which are largely handled by the parties themselves with no external oversight.\n\n\"This incident makes clear the extent to which nomination contests can be gateways for foreign states who wish to interfere in our democratic process,\" Hogue noted, adding that the inquiry would revisit the issue in the next stage of its work.\n\nTrudeau told the commission that he believed the allegations about Dong's riding would have to be revisited after the 2019 election, although it's not clear what action Trudeau or Liberal officials took to investigate. Dong was allowed to run for the Liberals again in 2021.\n\n\"I asked Mr. Trudeau whether the issue was revisited after the election. Mr. Trudeau testified that (the Liberal Party) investigated immediately after they received the information ... (but) he was not sure what more could have been done, as they were limited in the information they had,\" Hogue wrote.\n\n\"For him, the follow-up was about obtaining more clarity from intelligence agencies on the possible involvement of Chinese authorities with a nomination race and a particular candidate. However, the specifics of any follow-up are at this point unclear, and I am not certain what steps were taken.\"\n\nTrudeau testified at the inquiry that given the intelligence he received, removing Dong as the Liberal candidate would have been a drastic option.\n\nBut in an interview behind closed doors, he told Hogue that \"un-endorsing Mr. Dong would have direct electoral consequences, as the (Liberal Party of Canada) expected to win in (Don Valley North)\" adding it would have a \"devastating impact on Mr. Dong personally.\"\n\nThe Hogue report also revealed that CSIS issued a national security brief eight days after the 2019 election that suggested a \"politically-connected Canadian\" had been engaged in potential foreign interference.\n\n\"That person had not previously been identified as acting on behalf of a foreign state but appeared to have been doing so in the period leading up to the 2019 election. The report assessed that it was likely the actor 'has already had an impact on the 2019 federal election, and will remain a foreign interference threat after the election,'\" the report read.\n\nIt is not clear which \"politically-connected Canadian\" the memo referred to, but a senior CSIS official told the inquiry that they had long been a target of the agency. But after concerns were raised by members of the Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections task force, CSIS revised its assessment.\n\n\"An updated (bulletin), dated 3 December 2019, removed the assessment and said instead that the person's relationships and activities were consistent with known PRC tradecraft 'which could be expected to be applied to future elections at all levels,'\" the report read.\n\nBut aside from the direct political effects, Hogue's report makes clear that foreign interference disproportionately effects members of diaspora communities in Canada - discouraging them from participating in politics, speaking out publicly, or facing disinformation campaigns if they enter public life.\n\n\"These are not just facts that help me to understand foreign interference. They are the lived experience of thousands of Canadians who should have the right to enjoy the same rights and freedoms as other members of Canadian society,\" Hogue wrote.\n\n\"Foreign interference and transnational repression deny them that right. While all Canadians are victims of foreign interference when it occurs, it would be na\u00efve to say that it affects us all equally.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news",

But in a subsequent statement, she appeared to go a step further.\n\n\"There is one riding where disinformation may have led to the election of one candidate over another,\" said Hogue, who did not take questions Friday.\n\n\"But I cannot say for sure.\"\n\nDuring the campaign, misinformation about the Conservative Party, Erin O'Toole -- who was Conservative leader at the time -- and Chiu circulated on social media platforms with ties to the People's Republic of China (PRC), such as WeChat.\n\nChiu has said he believes he was targeted over his proposed bill to set up a public registry in Canada that would track foreign influence campaigns.\n\nHogue's report said while no definitive link between these false narratives and Beijing has been proven, \"there are strong indicators of PRC involvement.\"\n\nShe said there's a \"reasonable possibility that the media narrative\" could have affected the result in Steveston-Richmond East, but it's difficult to determine.\n\n\"Nonetheless, the acts of interference that occurred are a stain on our electoral process and impacted the process leading up to the actual vote,\" she said.\n\n\"The facts revealed by the evidence I have heard so far show that intelligence agencies collected information about troubling events that occurred in a handful of ridings during the 2019 and 2021 elections.\"\n\nO'Toole testified in April that he believes his party lost five to nine seats because of a foreign misinformation campaign aimed at Conservative candidates in B.C. and Ontario, and at his party more generally.\n\nHogue said in her report she didn't see evidence to match O'Toole's numbers but she did conclude that foreign interference \"likely impacted some votes.\"\n\n\"The fact that the narratives targeting Mr. Chiu and Mr. O'Toole had died down by election day does not mean they had no effect,\" Hogue wrote.\n\nChiu, who was first elected in the riding in 2019 after coming second in 2015, was defeated in the 2021

The report cites intelligence documents saying that international students were provided false documents and coerced to support the nomination of Mr. Dong, who went on to become MP in 2019 and winning reelection in 2021. The report notes that Mr. Dong denies involvement in these incidents.\n\nThe report notes that while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was told of these irregularities, he decided to review the matter after the election, saying he didn't feel the intelligence reports were \"sufficiently credible.\"\n\n\"In his in camera [private] testimony before me, Mr. Trudeau noted that un-endorsing Mr. Dong would have direct electoral consequences as the [Liberal Party] expected to win [Don Valley North]. It would also have a devastating impact on Mr. Dong personally,\" Justice Hogue wrote.\n\nCiting this part of the report, Tories said the prime minister's decisions \"were driven by Liberal political interests.\"\n\nMr. Dong resigned from the Liberal caucus last year amidst media reports about his relations with the Chinese consulate. So far, he hasn't been allowed back in caucus, despite expressing his desire to join the party again.\n\nDuring the 2021 election, the report notes that both then-Tory leader Erin O'Toole as well as Mr. Chiu were targeted by misinformation due to their strong stance against China's hostilities. It notes that as Mr. Chiu attempted to counter the false narratives circulated against him, \"his messaging was not picked up or circulated by Chinese-language outlets.\"\n\n\"There is a reasonable possibility that the false narratives could have impacted the results in this riding, but I cannot go further,\" Justice Hogue wrote about the election contest in Mr. Chiu's riding.\n\nThe report also notes that NDP MP Jenny Kwan was excluded from some local community events in Vancouver during election campaigns because of her stance against the Chinese regime's rights abuses.\n\nThe inquiry was held after persistent pressure by opposition parties amid media reports of Beijing's interference based on intelligence leaks. The Liberal government, which was opposed to holding an inquiry, initially appointed former Governor General David Johnston as special rapporteur to examine the issue, but he resigned last year as opposition parties were concerned about potential conflict of interest issues due to his ties with the Trudeau family.\n\nIn their statement, Tories acknowledged that while the report says the overall result of the elections were not changed, \"the Commissioner states that she could not rule out that it affected results at the riding level.\"\n\n\"For the sake of our democracy, the Trudeau Government cannot continue to dismiss and minimize the interference that did occur,\" the statement said.\n\nThe final report of the inquiry is expected before the end of the year this year. The next phase will be focusing on how the public can be informed of foreign interference threats, how information bout foreign interference can be communicated to the government, and reviewing the rules governing nomination contests.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

did not impact the outcome, a public commission reported Friday.\n\nThe Foreign Interference Commission published its first progress report after 21 days of hearings with testimony from intelligence chiefs, senior government officials and politicians.\n\nFor months, suspicions of interference -- notably by China -- in Canada's previous two national elections have put Trudeau's government under pressure, particularly after claims that Beijing sought to subvert Canada's democratic process.\n\n\"Acts of foreign interference did occur during the last two federal general elections, but they did not undermine the integrity of our electoral system,\" commissioner Marie-Josee Hogue said in the report.\n\nIt stressed that the Liberal Party would have won \"with or without foreign interference\" in the two elections, and that ballots themselves were cast and counted without tampering or meddling.\n\n\"Nonetheless, the acts of interference that occurred are a stain on our electoral process and impacted the process leading up to the actual vote,\" Hogue said.\n\nShe highlighted two mechanisms of interference -- disinformation and financial support -- which included bribery, blackmail, cyberattacks and spreading false messages through social media and mass media.\n\nThe commission said it \"views China as the biggest threat to the Canadian electoral space by a significant margin.\"\n\nThe findings in the interim report are preliminary and a final document is expected in December.\n\nBut \"we are not going to wait for the final report before continuing to strengthen our measures,\" Minister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc told journalists, adding that the government \"welcomes\" the initial findings.\n\nTrudeau testified before the panel last month, saying the country's recent elections were indeed \"decided by Canadians\" and that his government worked to thwart foreign interference.\n\nChina has always denied the accusations of meddling.\n\nTies between Ottawa and Beijing soured with the 2018 arrest, at US behest, of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.\n\nDays after her arrest, two Canadians -- businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig -- were arrested in China on what Canada said were trumped-up charges intended as retaliation for

Such registries are in place in the U.S. and Australia.\n\nThe idea is to make the work of foreign agents more transparent, with the prospect of fines or even prison time for those who fail to comply.\n\nThe bill comes just days after the public inquiry investigating foreign meddling issued its first report, which found foreign interference \"undermined the right of voters to have an electoral ecosystem free from coercion or covert influence.\"\n\nJustice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue, who is leading the inquiry, stressed that attempts at foreign interference did not affect which political party formed the government in the 2019 and 2021 general elections.\n\nHogue said none of the evidence she's heard to date suggests officials acted in \"bad faith\" or that information was deliberately and improperly withheld.\n\n\"But it does suggest that on some occasions, information related to foreign interference did not reach its intended recipient, while on others the information was not properly understood by those who received it,\" she wrote.\n\n\"These are serious issues that need to be investigated and considered.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foreign agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Security Intelligence Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominic LeBlanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public inquiry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Commons of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Peruvian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 Peruvian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bad faith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coercion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.7195657.1715022833!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/foreign-interference-20240503.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537828", "eventUri": "eng-9537828", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Those expectations were mostly dashed, or put on hold. This is not a \"who knew what, when?\" blockbuster, with guilty findings.\n\nUnreal expectations apart, the real litmus test for the work of the Foreign Interference Commission is how it stacks up against the report issued a year ago by the independent special rapporteur, David Johnston.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nCommissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue's findings do not depart in any material way from those reached by the much-maligned David Johnston.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe bottom line remains -- that while foreign interference attempts were detected they did not have any measurable impact on the outcome of free and fair elections in either 2019 or 2021. Conservative party claims advanced after the 2021 election that it lost between six and nine ridings because of Chinese state foreign interference are given little credence in the report.\n\nComparison between the Hogue and Johnston reports reveals some noticeable gaps. A big one is that issues of dysfunction in the intelligence system concerning dissemination of reports to senior officials and ministers are not explored. Johnston dealt with this at length and was blunt about failings.\n\nThere is no analysis offered on media reporting on Chinese foreign interference, reporting that in many ways sparked the creation of the inquiry. Johnston found that media reporting had created a misleading picture. Hogue steered clear of this issue; she also decided to say nothing on the problem of leaks.\n\nThere is no mention of the importance of the work of the new review bodies, the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency and the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, both of whom are due to produce their own reports on foreign interference in the near future. Give them a bow.\n\nThe discussion of disinformation and misinformation often confuses the two -- an elemental error that will have to be corrected in future reporting.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut it is fair to ask, amidst the inevitable criticisms -- has the commission opened our eyes to anything not previously covered by David Johnston? The answer is yes, in places.\n\nWe have learned something about efforts by the Indian government to interfere in Canadian democratic processes, and have been presented with surprising findings that the Russian government has been relatively passive, despite fears stemming from its efforts targeting the U.S. presidential election in 2016.\n\nWe have been treated to more granular detail about the work of the election protection mechanisms, especially the SITE (Security and Intelligence Threats to Elections) task force, responsible for fusing intelligence threat reporting, and the work of Global Affairs Canada's \"Rapid Response Mechanism\" to detect foreign originated disinformation efforts.\n\nThe real test for the commission moving forward is to understand the workings of the intelligence system -- what it can and cannot know. Intelligence may be an imperfect weapon, but it is on the front lines of foreign interference defences.\n\nAny stiffening of those defences involves improvements to the intelligence system, whether in the shape of better reporting, better dissemination, better attention to intelligence in decision-making, more transparency for a public audience, or greater outreach to targeted, especially diaspora communities, and politicians at all levels of government.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHow well will the commission engage on these issues? Hard to say, not least because of some puzzling statements in its first report, such as this: \"The nature of the information gathered and shared by intelligence agencies seems to raise the suspicions of many, who may prefer to refrain from acting when such information is brought to their attention.\" No elaboration is provided.\n\nCryptic word games in judicial inquiries are not really what a public audience needs, if the purpose of this effort is ultimately to improve public understanding of the foreign interference threat.

The commissioner may forward information it receives to law enforcement if necessary.\n\nIf the bill is approved, it provides a one-year timeline for the commissioner's office and the registry to be set up following royal assent. Government officials said the timeline speaks to the registry being a \"priority\" for the public safety ministry.\n\nThe multi-pronged legislation also includes updates to the CSIS Act, Criminal Code, Security and Information Act and Canada Evidence Act.\n\nIt would allow the Canada Security and Intelligence Service to provide more specific information when it warns Canadian individuals or businesses about foreign security threats they may face.\n\nThe bill was announced days after a double dose of announcements related to foreign interference brought the issue back into the spotlight Friday.\n\nThe commissioner overseeing an inquiry into foreign attempts to meddle in Canada's last two elections released an interim report that found those attempts undermined the rights of Canadian voters because they \"tainted the process\" and eroded public trust, even though they did not change the overall results.\n\nCommissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue stressed Ottawa needs to \"work hard\" to restore that trust by both informing Canadians of the threat of foreign interference and taking \"real and concrete steps\" to detect and deter it.\n\nHours after that report was released, RCMP announced it had arrested three Indian nationals charged with murder and conspiracy in the 2023 killing of B.C. Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar, whom India had declared was a \"terrorist.\" The federal government has said there are \"credible allegations of a potential link\" between Nijjar's death and agents of the Indian government.\n\nGlobal News reported Nijjar was warned by Canadian Security and Intelligence Service officers that \"professional assassins\" were after him, and that India had tried to get the RCMP to arrest Nijjar on allegations that were deemed to be not credible.\n\nAsked in an interview that aired Sunday on The West Block if he was still confident in Canada's security and intelligence services after they failed to prevent Nijjar's death, and in the wake of Hogue's interim report, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said he was.\n\nHe also defended the actions the government has taken so far to strengthen those agencies' ability to combat foreign threats, but added he agreed with Hogue's conclusion that more needs to be done, and hinted at the new legislation announced Monday.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score":

You'll have to wait until the inquiry's final report", "body": "Given an impossibly short deadline to complete the initial report of the public inquiry on foreign interference in federal elections - just two weeks from the close of hearings to publication - Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue has elected to punt on some of the key questions she was expected to address until her final report at the end of the year.\n\nThat, at least, must be the hope. This first instalment is, perhaps understandably, largely a \"what we heard\" exercise, summarizing the evidence while for the most part withholding judgment on what it all means.\n\nIt is a damning document all the same, for the conclusions she does reach, which may now seem so obvious as to be barely worth mentioning, were until recently hotly contested.\n\nThus Justice Hogue finds, inter alia, confirming intelligence reports:\n\nOn much else, however, the judge reaches only the most tentative conclusions, notably on two issues she was directed to examine, under the inquiry's terms of reference, in her first report: \"the flow of information\" to and between \"senior decision-makers, including elected officials,\" and \"actions taken in response.\"\n\nCertainly there is much in the report to suggest that the two-sided Plan to Protect Canadian Democracy established prior to the 2019 election - the first, to assess the intelligence on foreign interference; the second to alert the public, if necessary - did not work as well as it might.\n\nThe latter in particular, assigned to a panel of five senior civil servants under the Critical Election Incident Public Protocol, suffered from a very uncertain mandate, which the panelists appeared to define on the fly.\n\nIn fairness, the panel had only just been established. And there are legitimate questions as to what is the appropriate threshold for notifying the public. Too low, and you risk needlessly casting the integrity of the electoral process into doubt. Too high, and you risk looking like you're covering up.\n\nBut whether or not the public needed to be alerted, why could not there have been some private warning given to those most directly affected? The MPs targeted by China's disinformation campaigns were never told until long after. Neither was Conservative MP Michael Chong, the target of Chinese intimidation efforts.\n\nContrast that sluggishness, when it came to opposition MPs, with the alacrity with which disinformation about Justin Trudeau was run to the ground: one call from the Prime Minister's Office to Facebook, in the middle of the 2019 election campaign, and a post was deleted. Which raises its own troubling questions.\n\nMore troubling still are the questions that continue to swirl around the Prime Minister's handling of the Don Valley North nomination. There is no longer any doubt that he was told of the intelligence service's \"well-grounded suspicion\" of China's involvement. Neither is there any doubt that he chose to do nothing about it.\n\nMoreover, according to Justice Hogue, one of the reasons the Prime Minister gave her for not intervening, in testimony behind closed doors, was that it \"would have direct electoral consequences as the LPC expected to win\" the riding. Yet she is unable to draw any conclusions about his failure to take action at the time, or about what, if any, follow-up there has been since. (\"I am not certain what steps were taken.\")\n\nPerhaps that is yet to come. The judge is at pains to declare that the various questions assigned her under the inquiry's terms of reference \"are not watertight compartments,\" that her work \"on this part of my mandate cannot and will not end on 3 May 2024,\" and that \"my Final Report will have my complete set of conclusions and recommendations about these issues.\"\n\nVery well. But in that case what is the basis for her declaration, on the very last page of her initial report, that \"the evidence I have heard to date does not demonstrate bad faith on anyone's part, or that information was deliberately and improperly withheld\"?\n\nMaybe she's right. Maybe it's merely, as she suggests, that \"on some occasions, information related to foreign interference did not reach its intended recipient, while on others the information was not properly understood by those who received it.\" The cock-up theory of history is in most cases the correct one.\n\nBut surely these are among the questions that, in her estimation, \"require further study before I can make definitive recommendations.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_reference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terms of reference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public inquiry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Chong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Prime_Minister_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Valley_North", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Don Valley North"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compartment (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Email_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Email Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/GRNQUMNWWBAOLGISAE2ZXBYXN4.JPG?auth=85d52279a3927e848c18c49fb3fb50789fd0d07de93f7d49a6adcdcb32e2ea84&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537828", "eventUri": "eng-9537828", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

It found foreign interference in 2019 and 2021 undermined the right of Canadian voters to have an electoral process \"free from coercion or covert influence\" and may have affected results in a small number of ridings.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc told reporters Friday that the government won't wait for the final inquiry report to act. The government served notice Friday to the Commons that it will soon introduce legislation titled \"An Act respecting countering foreign interference.\"\n\nThe government has for months had a package of legislative reforms ready to be tabled to deal with foreign interference.\n\nIt's not clear how sweeping the legislation will be. The Globe has previously reported that Ottawa was considering a foreign-agent registry and changes to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Security of Information Act and the Criminal Code.\n\nOn Friday Mr. LeBlanc said the bill would \"reinforce our capacity concerning foreign interference.\"\n\nThe government last year also said it was considering amendments to existing legislation that could make it an offence to interfere with democratic processes, noting that existing law only addresses foreign interference in a limited way. Right now the offence is limited to circumstances where someone uses threats or violence to advance the interests of a foreign entity, and the burden is on the prosecution to show that the purpose was to increase the capacity of a foreign entity to harm Canadian interests, or where the threats or violence are reasonably likely to harm Canadian interests.\n\nMPs from all parties urge government to set up foreign agent registry\n\nDuring public consultations last year, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service proposed the spy agency be given the legal authority to disclose intelligence to entities such as universities, provinces and municipalities to help combat foreign interference.\n\nThe Canadian Security Intelligence Service released a consultation paper in 2023 seeking input on a number of proposed changes to the CSIS Act, one of which would allow it to discuss sensitive intelligence with parties beyond the federal government.\n\nCSIS said its governing legislation as currently written prevents it from speaking frankly to academic institutions about the threats they face. Canadian universities have been targets for espionage.\n\nThe same problem affects CSIS interactions with other levels of government.\n\nThe CSIS Act does not provide the agency \"with sufficient authority to disclose classified intelligence to domestic partners outside the government of Canada,\" CSIS said in its consultation paper.\n\nIn the consultation document, CSIS said that in the early 1980s, when the CSIS Act was written, \"national security was strictly the purview of the federal government.\" But today, it says, the responsibility is now a whole-of-society effort.\n\n\"Today, foreign interference impacts every level of government and all sectors of society, including Canadian communities, academia, the media, and private enterprises. CSIS's expertise and intelligence are increasingly relevant to those outside of the federal government, and these partners turn to CSIS more than ever for information.\"\n\nFive takeaways from the foreign-interference commission's report\n\nThe service is also seeking the power to collect electronic and digital information located outside the country that is tied to an investigation of a foreign national residing in Canada.\n\nCSIS is a domestic spy agency, but under Section 16 of its governing legislation it's also authorized to collect intelligence within Canada that relates to the capabilities, intentions or activities of foreign states.\n\nHowever, advances in technology have placed some of the information out of reach of CSIS.\n\nFor instance, if the foreigners in Canada whom CSIS is tracking are leaving messages on voice mail and e-mail services where data is stored outside the country on servers, the agency is currently barred from collecting that information.\n\nSection 16 of the CSIS Act contains the clauses that permit it, at the request of the foreign affairs minister or defence minister, to launch CSIS probes that can look at any foreigner, foreign corporation or foreign state \"within Canada.\"\n\nBut a 2018 Federal Court decision ruled that \"within Canada\" means CSIS can't pursue digital evidence outside Canada in these cases.\n\nLast September, one of Canada's largest business lobby groups urged the federal government to beef up its national security powers to protect against \"unprecedented dangers\" facing Canadian business from foreign states including China, Russia and Iran.\n\nOttawa urged to beef up national security measures to protect Canadian business\n\nThe Business Council of Canada said Canadian companies face a series of threats \"that erode Canada's economic competitiveness by tilting the playing field to other's advantage,\" including \"malign foreign interference,\" espionage, cyberattacks, \"co-opted academic research,\" and punitive trade actions that are \"weaponized\" by foreign states.\n\nThe Council said it wanted the federal government to rewrite the mandate of Canada's spy agency so security officials there can share detailed threats with people outside government, including private companies. Under the act governing the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, or CSIS, the agency can only advise the government and is limited in most situations from providing anything but generalized

And yet there it was, a 194-page brick of a summary. Although that begs the question: Who reads a 194-page behemoth full of government-speak?\n\nDespite its length, a lot of questions remain unanswered and some conclusions drawn are baffling -- and unsupported, to my mind.\n\nFirst, to the questions still in need of a response. Why was intelligence ignored? Why did the prime minister not take the time to read what CSIS (Canadian Security Intelligence Service) provided him and his team? Why did the PM say that CSIS intelligence is not good enough? Why did the Liberal Party not prevent busloads of non-Canadian citizens from attending nomination meetings? Why were opposition MPs not informed of attempts by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to undermine their campaigns? The list goes on and on.\n\nSecondly, many of the conclusive statements are anything but conclusive and reassuring. Justice Hogue stated at the very end of her report that \"the evidence I have heard to date does not demonstrate bad faith on anyone's part, or that information was deliberately and improperly withheld.\" Huh? What else does one call the deliberate sidelining of intelligence and a decision not to share it with those who need to know? A typical day at the office?\n\nFurthermore, she wrote: \"Votes are secret in Canada. It is therefore not possible to directly link the misleading media narrative with how any given voter cast their ballot. Furthermore, even assuming that some votes were changed, there is no way to know whether there was enough to affect the result.\" And yet she dismissed the overall effect on the results: \"I can conclude with confidence that the Liberal Party would have been in government with or without foreign interference in 2019 and 2021.\"\n\nThere is a disconnect here. Perhaps the Liberals would have indeed won even with PRC actions -- which were in their favour and in support of their interests, by the way -- but there is no way to tell just how much of the vote was swayed thanks to PRC interference. Madame Justice is far too cocky in her conclusions as to the outcome of our vote.\n\nNaively, she wrote that \"the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, which communicates a great deal of information and works hard to raise awareness of the importance of tackling foreign interference, is nevertheless circumspect with details when informing others of the intelligence it has gathered and the conclusions it has drawn.\" Circumspect? No, required care when it comes to sources and methods. This single sentence demonstrates an appalling lack of understanding on how intelligence works and is further proof of what I call a poor intelligence culture in Canada. No, CSIS does not have all the answers and is not perfect, but the degree of care and review that takes place before information of this nature and import is shared is tremendous. CSIS did its due diligence; its clients, i.e., the prime minister, his team, and the wider bureaucracy did not.\n\nApparently there is more to come (194 pages was not enough?). Maybe we will learn more when the next doorstop of a report is made public. Until then, we are left with a worrying notion that foreign interference, which did occur without any doubt, left a \"stain\" on our democracy and undermined Canadians' trust in the whole election process, as stated in the report. A stain is something you leave on your couch when you spill the salsa while celebrating a Vancouver Canucks goal.

interference, but he wouldn't say whether the proposal will include a foreign agent registry.\n\nLeBlanc -- who also serves as the minister of public safety and intergovernmental affairs -- said he's put a bill aimed at combatting foreign interference on notice, paving way for it to be tabled in the House of Commons in the coming days.\n\nThere have long been calls for the federal government to implement such a registry -- an online searchable database of agents working for foreign governments, similar to the systems in place in Australia and the United States -- but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said it is a \"complex\" file.\n\nIn an interview on CTV's Question Period airing Sunday, when asked by host Vassy Kapelos whether one of the tools the government is proposing to counter foreign interference is a registry, LeBlanc said he wouldn't discuss the details of the legislation before it's tabled.\n\n\"I want to be respectful of Parliament,\" he said. \"There are rules around discussing legislation before it's introduced in Parliament.\"\n\nLast fall, members of the House ethics committee released an 82-page report at the conclusion of their monthslong study on foreign interference, and in it called on the government to act on their nearly two dozen recommendations, including putting in place a foreign agent registry \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nAnd last September, LeBlanc told Kapelos in an interview on CTV News Channel's Power Play that his government \"hope(d) to proceed quickly\" on legislation to implement such a registry.\n\nLeBlanc's most recent interview comes on the heels of commissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue releasing the first of two expected reports in the foreign interference inquiry.\n\nHogue's interim report, released Friday, with the final report set for the end of this year, concludes there was foreign interference in both the 2019 and 2021 federal elections, which may have affected two ridings, but the overall election outcomes were not impacted.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score":

The United States has had one for decades.\n\nWhat Ottawa is proposing within its new bill is a new Foreign Influence Transparency and Accountability Act, and a foreign influence transparency commissioner in charge of overseeing a new registry system.\n\nCertain people deemed \"foreign principals\" under the new law, who are carrying out certain activities designed to influence a specific list of activities -- including policy or who runs for elections -- would have to register, and could face penalties as high as $5 million or a prison term if they don't.\n\nDiplomats would be exempt as their activities within Canada are governed by the international law on consular relations. A Chinese diplomat in Canada was expelled last year after being exposed as seeking information on Conservative MP Michael Chong for possible retaliation.\n\nIt's not the first legislative effort to enact a registry.\n\nIn 2021, then-Conservative MP Kenny Chiu introduced a private member's bill to create one, a move that would later factor into a misinformation campaign directed at him, and his party in that year's federal election campaign.\n\nThe Hogue report concluded that the campaign was likely linked to Chinese-state actors and affected votes in Chiu's riding, a nod to the stakes at play when foreign actors seek to flex their muscle.\n\nThe government had begun musing about creating a registry in earnest last year as intelligence documents began circulating in the media laying out suspected instances of foreign state interference, and with them, questions about the Liberals' response.\n\nPublic consultations were held last spring, which led to the government also deciding to pursue other legislative changes as well that could act as a stronger deterrent to foreign state meddling, some of which are now wrapped into the bill.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

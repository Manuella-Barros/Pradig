I saw her fight Kirstie Bavington but that's it. That's not uncommon though I'm from the States, it's like two different worlds,\" McCaskill told Sky Sports.\n\nShe warned: \"Every fight I've had has put me up levels. That should put me above Lauren Price because she's only had a small amount of pro fights.\n\n\"Amateur is amateur and pro is pro, you can't mix the two.\"\n\nPrice may not match McCaskill's professional experience, but she is still favoured by many to win. McCaskill appears aware of the dangers a youthful and hungry challenger possesses.\n\n\"Lauren is smart enough not to do certain things and make herself available in certain situations. The plan will be [about] getting to that point where I can land a clean punch,\" Chicago's McCaskill said.\n\n\"I saw a lot of mistakes from her opponents [where I'm] asking why did you do this? And then I can't watch anymore. We want to make sure we are smart. Cut off the ring properly.\n\n\"The fight could be me chasing her down or me fighting her hold. We've seen especially in the female fights there's this game of hit and hold. European fighters will hold.\n\n\"I don't rely on one specific thing. I see particular manoeuvres from her. I'm not sure if she's got that level of boxing maturity yet but we will see.\"\n\nCompeting in an 11th consecutive world title bout is nothing short of extraordinary for 39-year-old McCaskill, who has worked her way to the top.\n\n\"There are so many things behind boxing that people don't talk about, and I think those are really important elements especially now that things are being highlighted from the past,\" she said.\n\n\"These old deals, contracts, costing people money. We did things the right way and it's why we are here to talk about it today.\"\n\nA two-weight world champion, McCaskill wants to head into hostile territory and come out with her reputation enhanced.\n\n\"Look, you can travel here and make a name for yourself and steal the fans,\" she declared.\n\n\"I want to put on a great show. You guys have amazing boxing fans.\"\n\nMcCaskill believes this bout could lead her to face another British world champion, Natasha Jonas, who holds the IBF title at welterweight.\n\n\"Natasha and I have had conversations. We would love to fight Natasha. She has a lot of fans and is coming to the end of her career but definitely deserves more title fights before she's done,\" McCaskill said.\n\n\"I know Jonas to be technical and have experience. She's definitely the prize at the end of the rainbow that I'm looking for.\"\n\nIt's one of the biggest sporting events in a generation.

The boxer has earned that right.\n\nThe 29-year-old has stepped up to world class in her seventh professional boxing fight as she faces former undisputed world champion Jessica McCaskill at Cardiff 's Utilita Arena this Saturday. The American's WBA and Ring Magazine welterweight titles, as well an IBO title, are up for grabs, as is the chance to become Wales' first women's boxing world champion and doing so in front of a home crowd.\n\nPrice's confidence is supreme and unflapped. The Olympic gold medallist has imagined this moment for years and knows the contours of how it ends. So she wants her walk-on song to be a surprise. \"It's definitely Welsh,\" she tells the Mirror. But any further details will spoil the surprise. And if Price wants to do anything come Saturday night, it's to land as many surprises as possible.\n\nMcCaskill - 39 and boasting 12 wins, three draws and only one loss in her career - knows the mercurial black magic that is a hungry tyro with nothing to lose. In 2021 it was McCaskill - a then-35-year-old investment banker moonlighting as a boxer - who dethroned Cecilia Br\u00e6khus, the undisputed welterweight champion widely regarded as the sport's pound-for-pound world No 1, by majority decision. If some critics posited that the margins were too narrow, McCaskill fought and beat Br\u00e6khus again the following year.\n\nThe fight was one heard around the world, and one McCaskill, fighting a remarkable 11th consecutive world title fight come Saturday, views as another example of the \"levels\" which distinguish her and Price. But Price insists such upsets of the landscape are all part of the sport's natural life cycle. Eventually those who topple get toppled. And so on.\n\n\"She can say what she wants, it's going to be a great fight because she brings the best out of me,\" Price said. \"I've been comfortable in my professional career winning every round and I believe I'll box well against her and I'll win.\n\n\"Obviously she is going to turn it into a war and I need to stick to my boxing and do what I do best. I'm 100% confident and I 100% believe that I will come out victorious on May 11. I have a lot of respect for what she's done in her career and she's a legitimate champion but I believe that I'll come out on top.\"\n\nPrice has reason to feel confident. The former footballer turned kick-boxing champion turned taxi driver turned Olympic gold medallist has taken to life as a professional boxer with the characteristic aplomb that defined her previous exploits.\n\nPrice has only fought six professional fights but has won every round she's contested, including her shutout victory over Kirstie Bavington to become the inaugural women's British champion last year. Price has looked so effortlessly imperious that the general consensus is she's yet to tap anywhere close to the finished article of her potential boxing evolution arc.\n\n\"This is definitely my toughest test but it's nothing that I've not seen before,\" says Price, who insists her Olympic background will serve as an advantage. \"The amateurs are different but I've been in the ring with 75-kilo Russians running at me and I've come out on top. So I've experienced all styles of boxing, that's one of the great aspects of being a top amateur and going to the Olympics.\"\n\nShe adds: \"The blueprint for McCaskill, you see what she's about in all of her fights. She's going to try to rough me up, drag me into a fight, make it a tear-up. It's down to me to stick to my boxing and outbox her and make it as easy for myself as I can. I can't see her outboxing me. If anything it's better for me, her charging at me and me picking my shots and going from there.\"\n\nWhile Price might have come up against similar styles, McCaskill's pedigree is certainly something she's yet to experience. As is fighting in front of a home crowd.\n\nPrice received a hero's welcome when she returned to her home town of Ystrad Mynach for the first time after winning the gold medal at the 2016 Olympics. Now, she hopes to entice that same crowd ringside with her first homecoming since turning professional.\n\n\"I want to bring big nights back to Cardiff,\" she says. \"Since I turned professional, that's been one of my biggest goals. Obviously once the bell goes, I block everything out. But that's how I've been brought up from a boxing point of view, never listen to the crowd. She [McCaskill] is coming into the Dragon's Den.\n\n\"It's going to be a special night and I'm excited more than anything. This is just the start.\"\n\nThat's the sentiment from many considering the ramifications of Saturday's fight. A first defeat for Price in her professional career wouldn't bring devastation. The opportunity to learn and evolve is there. Yet, victory would supercharge everything. Whatever Price's mooted ceiling is currently, augment that by one hundred.\n\n\"I don't look at anyone's opinion, good or bad. I get what he's saying but I believe I'm going to win this fight, that's the only mentality I've got.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_feringa@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Megan Feringa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Br\u00e6khus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cecilia Br\u00e6khus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_McCaskill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica McCaskill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Price", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lauren Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Arena", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield Arena"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Ring (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickboxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kickboxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ystrad_Mynach", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ystrad Mynach"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ystrad Mynach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32758929.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-2081034884.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548615", "eventUri": "eng-9548615", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 2139, "textEnd": 2145}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

To create a Welsh legacy, be in massive fights, and be an undisputed and multi-weight world champion.\n\nLEGEND: Ireland's Katie Taylor (Image: PA)\n\n\"You've seen what Katie Taylor has done for Ireland and I want to do the same for Wales.\n\n\"She's a legend all over the world, but in Ireland the fans come out to see her, they travel to Vegas and all over.\n\n\"To have my fan base like that, starting on Saturday and to keep going, would be special. We're a small nation like Ireland and we support our own too.\"\n\nMcCaskill - who lost a unanimous points decision to Taylor at lightweight in 2017 - unified the WBA and WBC super-lightweight titles before moving up to welterweight to end Cecilia Braekhus' decade-long reign in the division.\n\nBut the 39-year-old, who fights out of Chicago, is coming off the back of a defeat to Chantelle Cameron in her bid to become a two-weight undisputed champion and a September draw with Sandy Ryan.\n\nPrice said: \"This fight is a big step up against a legitimate champion and she is going to ask questions of me at times.\n\n\"I've had six fights as a pro and won every single round comfortably using my boxing skills.\n\n\"I know I'm going to have to fight at times in this one. I haven't done that yet but, I can assure everyone, when I do have to bite down on my gumshield and have a war I can do that as well.\n\n\"I've had 75 kilo Russians running at me in the amateurs. I respect that the amateurs are completely different from the pros, but once you've been across different styles you've experienced everything really.\n\n\"Even winning on Saturday won't beat that Olympic medal. I don't think people understand when I say that.\n\n\"You hear (Vasiliy) Lomachenko and (Oleksandr) Usyk say their gold medals mean everything to them because just to qualify for an Olympic Games is so hard.\"\n\nThursday's pre-fight press conference was held in a suite high up at Cardiff City Stadium - and Price could not resist gazing down on the pitch once it was over.\n\nIt is exactly 10 years since Price gave up an impressive football career to focus on boxing.\n\n\"I've played Champions League on this pitch and international games for Wales,\" said Price.\n\n\"To box here and sell out this stadium is a dream.

I shut all the noise out, the good and the bad.\n\n\"I know amateur is different to professional game, but to win an Olympic gold medal is a lot harder than winning a world title in my opinion. There's nothing harder than winning an Olympic gold medal and I believe the likes of Vasiliy Lomachenko, Oleksandr Usyk, they say the same thing. Anyone who has been to the Olympics, and gone through it, I think they would say the same thing.\"\n\nPrice, who went into the Games in Tokyo as a favorite to win gold, believes the experience at the Olympics will help her in her title fight.\n\n\"I've always had pressure on me but if anything, I rise to that through my boxing career and football career,\" Price said. \"Captaining Wales under-19 at football and other experiences have put me where I am today.\n\n\"It will mean the world for me to fight in Cardiff and I want to create a legacy for Welsh boxing and bring big boxing nights back to Cardiff. I was young when [Hall of Famer] Joe Calzaghe was fighting and what he did for Wales was incredible. I want to follow in Joe's footsteps by creating more history by becoming the first Welsh women's world champion.\"\n\nMcCaskill (12-3-1, 5 KOs), 39, beat Cecilia Braekhus in back-to-back fights in 2020 and 2021 to become undisputed welterweight champion. The Chicago-based boxer is also a unified champion at junior welterweight but in her last fight drew with England's Sandy Ryan, who is now the WBO titleholder. McCaskill suffered decision loses to Katie Taylor and Chantelle Cameron, of England, at junior welterweight in 2017 and 2022 respectively, but she is unbeaten at welterweight and will be making a fifth title defense versus Price.\n\nPrice, a southpaw who has sparred with Cameron recently, expects McCaskill to try and draw her into a brawl.\n\n\"You see what you get with Jessica, she's rough, tough, tries to rough you up,\" Price said. \"She's a bit of brawler and swings a lot. I don't think her defense is great, she takes quite a lot of shots like she did against Sandy, and I saw the way Chantelle boxed her.\n\n\"She's a great fighter, my toughest test and she will ask questions of me at times but I believe I will come out on top. If you're a better boxer, you are going to out-box her. She will try to drag you into a dog fight, but if you have speed and good feet, then I think it will make it very hard for her.\"\n\nPrice used to play football to a good standard for club side Cardiff City and also made two senior international appearances for Wales, with 52 appearances in total for all age groups and senior Wales teams. But Price has no intention of mixing the two sports like middleweight queen Claressa Shields does with boxing and MMA.\n\n\"Right now I am just concentrating on boxing, that's my main focus,\" Price said. \"I don't think I will go back to football and I've not played it for a while.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The boxer has earned that right.\n\nThe 29-year-old has stepped up to world class in her seventh professional boxing fight as she faces former undisputed world champion Jessica McCaskill at Cardiff 's Utilita Arena this Saturday. The American's WBA and Ring Magazine welterweight titles, as well an IBO title, are up for grabs, as is the chance to become Wales' first women's boxing world champion and doing so in front of a home crowd.\n\nPrice's confidence is supreme and unflapped. The Olympic gold medallist has imagined this moment for years and knows the contours of how it ends. So she wants her walk-on song to be a surprise. \"It's definitely Welsh,\" she tells the Mirror. But any further details will spoil the surprise. And if Price wants to do anything come Saturday night, it's to land as many surprises as possible.\n\nMcCaskill - 39 and boasting 12 wins, three draws and only one loss in her career - knows the mercurial black magic that is a hungry tyro with nothing to lose. In 2021 it was McCaskill - a then-35-year-old investment banker moonlighting as a boxer - who dethroned Cecilia Br\u00e6khus, the undisputed welterweight champion widely regarded as the sport's pound-for-pound world No 1, by majority decision. If some critics posited that the margins were too narrow, McCaskill fought and beat Br\u00e6khus again the following year.\n\nThe fight was one heard around the world, and one McCaskill, fighting a remarkable 11th consecutive world title fight come Saturday, views as another example of the \"levels\" which distinguish her and Price. But Price insists such upsets of the landscape are all part of the sport's natural life cycle. Eventually those who topple get toppled. And so on.\n\n\"She can say what she wants, it's going to be a great fight because she brings the best out of me,\" Price said. \"I've been comfortable in my professional career winning every round and I believe I'll box well against her and I'll win.\n\n\"Obviously she is going to turn it into a war and I need to stick to my boxing and do what I do best. I'm 100% confident and I 100% believe that I will come out victorious on May 11. I have a lot of respect for what she's done in her career and she's a legitimate champion but I believe that I'll come out on top.\"\n\nPrice has reason to feel confident. The former footballer turned kick-boxing champion turned taxi driver turned Olympic gold medallist has taken to life as a professional boxer with the characteristic aplomb that defined her previous exploits.\n\nPrice has only fought six professional fights but has won every round she's contested, including her shutout victory over Kirstie Bavington to become the inaugural women's British champion last year. Price has looked so effortlessly imperious that the general consensus is she's yet to tap anywhere close to the finished article of her potential boxing evolution arc.\n\nLauren Price MBE fights Jessica McCaskill in Cardiff\n\n\"This is definitely my toughest test but it's nothing that I've not seen before,\" says Price, who insists her Olympic background will serve as an advantage. \"The amateurs are different but I've been in the ring with 75-kilo Russians running at me and I've come out on top. So I've experienced all styles of boxing, that's one of the great aspects of being a top amateur and going to the Olympics.\"\n\nShe adds: \"The blueprint for McCaskill, you see what she's about in all of her fights. She's going to try to rough me up, drag me into a fight, make it a tear-up. It's down to me to stick to my boxing and outbox her and make it as easy for myself as I can. I can't see her outboxing me. If anything it's better for me, her charging at me and me picking my shots and going from there.\"\n\nWhile Price might have come up against similar styles, McCaskill's pedigree is certainly something she's yet to experience. As is fighting in front of a home crowd.\n\nPrice received a hero's welcome when she returned to her home town of Ystrad Mynach for the first time after winning the gold medal at the 2016 Olympics. Now, she hopes to entice that same crowd ringside with her first homecoming since turning professional.\n\nLauren Price celebrates winning her British title with partner Karriss Artingstall\n\n\"I want to bring big nights back to Cardiff,\" she says. \"Since I turned professional, that's been one of my biggest goals. Obviously once the bell goes, I block everything out. But that's how I've been brought up from a boxing point of view, never listen to the crowd. She [McCaskill] is coming into the Dragon's Den.\n\n\"It's going to be a special night and I'm excited more than anything. This is just the start.\"\n\nThat's the sentiment from many considering the ramifications of Saturday's fight. A first defeat for Price in her professional career wouldn't bring devastation. The opportunity to learn and evolve is there. Yet, victory would supercharge everything. Whatever Price's mooted ceiling is currently, augment that by one hundred.\n\n\"I don't look at anyone's opinion, good or bad. I get what he's saying but I believe I'm going to win this fight, that's the only mentality I've got.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_feringa@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Megan Feringa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_McCaskill", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jessica McCaskill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Price", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lauren Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Br\u00e6khus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cecilia Br\u00e6khus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Arena", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield Arena"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Ring (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickboxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kickboxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karriss_Artingstall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karriss Artingstall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Order of the British Empire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ystrad_Mynach", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ystrad Mynach"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ystrad Mynach"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32746591.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2081034884.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548615", "eventUri": "eng-9548615", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 2139, "textEnd": 2145}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

She knows that will change when she steps out in front of a raucous Cardiff crowd this weekend.\n\n\"I think she'll bring the best out in me,\" Price told Sky Sports. \"I think my last fights have been quite comfortable, I've won every round on the scorecards.\n\n\"I think when she brings her A game, you'll see the best of me, there's lots more to come from me. And each fight I keep learning, I keep improving.\n\n\"I can definitely fight. I can mix it all. I've had to get in there with some big girls at middleweight and obviously to win Olympic gold medals, I've had to hold my own and those girls have had a lot of weight on me and I've had to fight them off.\n\n\"I can definitely stand there and trade when I want to. But first of all it's called boxing, it's all about the skills.\"\n\nWhat might be deemed a fast track to the world title stage in fact feels like a natural progression for Price, who had anticipated a swift-moving start to her professional career such had been her success at the amateur level.\n\nMcCaskill arrives 10 years older than Price, though boasts a resume that has seen her dethrone the great Cecilia Br\u00e6khus as well as go the distance with Chantelle Cameron - who would later defeat Katie Taylor - and draw against rising star Sandy Ryan. She is no stranger to marquee matchups, but Price feels she will carry an edge over the American come fight night.\n\n\"I'm in my prime,\" said Price. \"I'm young, I'm motivated and I've got big goals, big dreams.\n\n\"Yes it's only my seventh pro fight, but what I've achieved in my amateur career, I've got to the pinnacle of sport and won an Olympic gold medal. I feel like I'm more than ready. I believe that I win that fight and that's it really.\n\n\"I know she's obviously going to bring her toughness and try and rough me up and turn it into a dog fight, but that's down to me to use my skills, stick to my boxing and listen to my corner.\"\n\nWhile a Welsh homecoming awaits Price, McCaskill insists she is not fazed by the possibility of a hostile atmosphere. In her eyes, the onus is on Price.\n\n\"The pressure is going to be on Lauren because when you think of a fighter and fights and champions coming in then you think the other person really has to do something to take the belt so I feel like the pressure is on her,\" said McCaskill.\n\n\"She really has to do something to take the belt, she can't just win because she's from here. She is going to have to put on quite a performance. I just have to see what she's got.\"\n\nPrice believes her amateur experience and nous will guide her to victory. McCaskill believes her professional experience and nous will guide her to victory.\n\nThere aren't too many styles the pair will have not encountered at either level. McCaskill has faith that hers will prevail.\n\n\"When it comes to how this fight is set up, when you think of my experience and her being fresh in the professional game, there's always going to be a mental state that you keep and they might expect me to be wild and big and overreact,\" she said.\n\n\"If you come in and you're calm that upsets people and makes people worry and panic so it's about keeping the control of this situation and being elusive and not overdoing things.\"\n\nMcCaskill has embraced the trip to Cardiff to defend her belts, visiting local boxing gyms in Wales and taking the time to pose for photos with Welsh fans who she laughs would later admit they are rooting against her.\n\nThe nature of her business trip entails not only retaining her titles, but earning herself new fans and a new respect at the same time. Where others may fear away territory, McCaskill has drawn on her previous travels in order to soak up the week.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of difference in the mental game, staying cool, calm and collected. When you're fighting away, not a lot of people come with you, there are times people travel but you bring things to keep your mind in a calm state,\" she said.\n\n\"I have a couple of books, making bracelets, making sure your mind is in a certain place, not just being in the room watching TV waiting for this thing, or that thing, not making boxing make you anxious and physically, coming to Wales on weight was important to me because the first couple of days is travel and you miss out on the workouts.\n\n\"When you come on weight you don't have to worry and you go straight into what your workout is. Not overworking, if I need my strength and conditioning coach, we can do a Zoom call and workouts together and having a solid team, not being afraid of saying what I want and need and having a team that is receptive to that.\n\n\"It's important for athletes to stand up and have those conversations with their team.\"\n\nAt the age of 39, McCaskill has faced questions over what else might lie ahead in her career.\n\nWhat Price should be ready for, however, is a fighter with no less hunger to triumph than she had earlier in her career.\n\n\"Taking a fight like this demonstrates this, there isn't a shortage of opponents to fight Jessica,\" said McCaskill's trainer Rick Ramos.\n\n\"We'll prove Saturday night we're still the best.\"\n\nIt's one of the biggest sporting events in a generation.

The fight is in the Cardiff International Arena.\n\nA multi-time Golden Gloves winner following a late start in boxing, McCaskill lost against Katie Taylor for lightweight gold but would win the WBA and WBC super lightweight belts. In the streets of Oklahoma, McCaskill outworked trailblazer Cecilia Braekhus to become the undisputed welterweight champion.\n\n\"CasKILLA\" attempted to become undisputed at super lightweight, forcing the removal of several belts at 147. She lost against Cameron and, in an attempt to regain undisputed status, fought Sandy Ryan to a controversial draw. May believed Ryan won the contest. McCaskill now goes from an English fighter to facing a Welsh one.\n\n\"I don't know much about Price, but when it comes to fighters from the U.K., the expectation is usually lots of backpedaling and holding,\" McCaskill said. \"I don't know if this will be the case, but coming to Wales means Price is hopefully going to want to put on a good show. That's exactly what I want because I plan on doing the same. I'm here to steal all of her fans. I'm going to show her what it takes to be a champion, and the belts will be coming back to America with me.\"\n\nMORE: Who is the best female pound-for-pound in the world?\n\nPrice won gold in the 2020 Olympics. The former football player won the British welterweight title in 2023, a first for British women.

She's game, experienced, and strong, but I'll be 100% ready for whatever she brings on the night. I believe in my ability,\" Price said. \"I back myself, and like I said earlier, I can't wait to bring those world titles back home to Wales, and hopefully, this will line me up to bring more massive nights back to Wales in the near future.\"\n\nHere's all you need to know about this fight, from time, channel, odds, card and more.\n\nJessica McCaskill vs. Lauren Price is on May 11.

The cage door will close behind the two-weight boxing world champion for the first time at a PFL event in Newcastle, England, on June 8.\n\nMarshall, 32, may currently be engrossed with the intricacies of her new sport, but she is still keeping a keen eye on the constantly shifting sands of women's boxing.\n\nAlthough she would love the middle and super middleweight divisions to be as vibrant as the lower weight classes currently are, Marshall accepts that is unlikely to happen anytime soon and would settle for a viable contender to emerge at 160 or 168 pounds,\n\n\"It's weird, because at one point lightweight was bouncing,\" Marshall told BoxingScene. \"Then it went to super feather. Then it went to super welter, with Natasha Jonas and Terri Harper. Now it's welter. The pool of women at middle and super middle is just so shallow. You never know, middle or super middle might get a bit spicy, but I can't see it in the near future.\"\n\nAs Marshall says, welterweight has become the place to be.\n\nThe division has had real strength in depth since becoming the permanent home for a group of well-known fighters who have spent the past couple of years moving up and down the weight classes.\n\nIn January, Natasha Jonas cemented her status as the best welterweight on the planet, clinging to her IBF title after 10 toe-to-toe rounds with Mikaela Mayer, while WBO champion Sandy Ryan recently pushed her own claims by dominating Terri Harper over four one-sided rounds.\n\nOn Saturday, 2020 Olympic gold medalist Lauren Price will get her first world title shot when she boxes former undisputed champion Jessica McCaskill for her WBA belt.\n\nMarshall believes that the 29-year-old Price has the style, fitness and discipline to not only outclass Chicago's McCaskill but also fight her way to the top of the pile.\n\n\"Welterweight is buzzing, and I think Lauren Price beats them all,\" Marshall said. \"I can't see McCaskill winning a round. The thing that's a bit special about Lauren is that she's taken her amateur style over and, whereas normally you'd see fighters die off after four rounds, Lauren can keep that footwork up for 10 rounds. The pro game's a lot more flat-footed, looking for your shots, whereas Lauren's took her footwork over. And I can't see anyone getting near her, especially McCaskill, who has got slow, ploddy feet.\"\n\nMarshall may be confident that Price has what it takes to emerge as the best welterweight on the planet, but she also believes that she will eventually have to prove it against the dangerous Ryan, who was extremely unfortunate in having to settle for a split draw when she boxed McCaskill last year.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_Marshall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Savannah Marshall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franch\u00f3n_Crews-Dezurn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franch\u00f3n Crews-Dezurn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terri_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terri Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Fighters_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Fighters League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natasha_Jonas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natasha Jonas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight class (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Price", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lauren Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super featherweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikaela_Mayer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikaela Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_McCaskill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica McCaskill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sandy Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_draw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split draw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.boxingscene.com/uploads/marshall-crews-dezurn-fight%20(20).jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548615", "eventUri": "eng-9548615", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 391, "textEnd": 397}], "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

I'll be watching 100 per cent.\"\n\nBraekhus previously reigned as female boxing's most dominant figure with a 36-fight unbeaten streak that spanned 13 years and saw her defend all four major welterweight world titles on 10 occasions. Missing from her glittering resume, though, is an appearance at the Olympic Games, which only welcomed female boxing to the scene in 2012.\n\nPrice became the latest beacon of Olympic success in Tokyo when she marched to a famous gold medal, Braekhus welcoming it as yet further progress for the sport.\n\n\"I'm just super happy that it happened,\" she continued. The first time women were put on in the Olympics it was like, 'oh my god, it's just so new, all so new'.\n\n\"When it happened I was afraid I was going to feel a little bit angry and bitterness, but to be honest I didn't happen. I was just so happy that we finally were there, that we were finally over that hurdle because honestly, I didn't know if that would ever happen.\n\n\"And like we predicted, that was one of the reasons that female boxing also blew up and there were more resources put in to women's boxing, more to the team, to training, to coaches. So that was a real vitamin boost for women's boxing, and I could only be happy about it.\"\n\nWhile she may not have featured on the Olympic stage, the 42-year-old takes pride in having played a part in laying the foundations for what has become a blossoming women's scene.\n\n\"When we were travelling around the world, we didn't get paid, we paid for everything ourselves,\" she said. \"We slept in the craziest places. We didn't get anything back materialistic, we only did it because we love the sport.\n\n\"We did it for the friendship, for the camaraderie, for the experiences. All the women who were part of that era just feel some kind of pride that we endured all that because without us we wouldn't be where we are today.\"\n\nAs for a potential match-up with Price before hanging up her gloves, Braekhus suggested it would have to be at a different weight.\n\n\"We'd love the fight, but like I say, I cannot do 147. That is not going to happen!\" she said.\n\nIt's one of the biggest sporting events in a generation.

It's going to be my toughest fight. I know that and I respect that but I still believe that I'm the better boxer.\n\n\"I can't see her outboxing me in any way. But that's her game, to make it messy and rough,\" Price added.\n\n\"If anything it's better for me, her charging at me and me picking my shots and going from there.\"\n\nAlthough her professional experience might be limited, Price is convinced her amateur background, in which she boxed and beat all the best opponents across the globe to win Olympic, World, European and Commonwealth Games gold medals, has prepared her for this moment.\n\n\"Every style I've come across in the amateurs has obviously set me up for fights like this,\" Price said. \"I'm at my peak. I'm just ready for it. She's been around, she's done it.\n\n\"I respect her as well for taking the fight for starters. I called a lot of the champions out and I didn't really get much back.\n\n\"It's a good fight, a fight I believe I'm ready for and I'm going to win.\"\n\nThe opportunity is all the more important to her as it will be a homecoming fight - her first bout in Wales in a decade.\n\n\"A big thing I haven't experienced yet is fighting at home with a home crowd. But obviously I'm going to enjoy that as much as possible, soak it all in, take in the atmosphere and then when I'm in the ring, I've got to switch on and get down to business,\" she said.\n\n\"That was one of the things I wanted to do, was headline in Wales and put Wales on the map and bring big nights back to Cardiff.\"\n\nPrice's ambitions really are just beginning.\n\n\"We've seen what Katie Taylor's done for Ireland and I want to do the same for Wales,\" she said.\n\n\"I want to be involved in big fights. I want to fight in Cardiff. I want to create that legacy. I want to go on for a few years and become a multi-weight world champion and create greatness.\"\n\nIt's one of the biggest sporting events in a generation.

It was the perfect response to losing her undisputed fight against Claressa Shields at 160. Marshall then suffered an injury, preventing her from facing her WBC mandatory Shadasia Green.\n\nCrews-Dezurn would step in to win the vacant WBC belt. Marshall would then sign with the PFL. She makes her debut on June 8. While her focus is on MMA, she had plenty to say about her weight class in boxing, showing the decline in her division.\n\n\"It's weird, because at one point lightweight was bouncing. Then it went to super feather. Then it went to super welter, with Natasha Jonas and Terri Harper. Now it's welter. The pool of women at middle and super middle is just so shallow. You never know, middle or super middle might get a bit spicy, but I can't see it in the near future,\" Marshall said\n\nMarshall expanded on her view of the welterweight division, seeing it as the most competitive weight class. Natasha Jonas is the IBF champion, beating Mikaela Mayer in a controversial decision. Sandy Ryan stopped Terri Harper to remain the WBO champ. As Lauren Price gets her first title shot for the WBA belt against Jessica McCaskill, the 147 division is booming.\n\n\"Welterweight is buzzing, and I think Lauren Price beats them all. I can't see McCaskill winning a round. The thing that's a bit special about Lauren is that she's taken her amateur style over and, whereas normally you'd see fighters die off after four rounds, Lauren can keep that footwork up for 10 rounds. The pro game's a lot more flat-footed, looking for your shots, whereas Lauren's took her footwork over.

She is not daunted and like Joe Calzaghe, the man known as the \"Italian Dragon\", before her, Price aims to breathe fire into boxing in Wales, just as Joe Cordina is attempting to do in men's boxing.\n\n\"When I turned professional there was the high expectation of me moving fast, winning world titles, and there's no better way I suppose than to jump in the mix with a legitimate champion who's been there and done it, but I'm 100 per cent confident I'll get the job done,\" says Price of the McCaskill fight, which will be live on Sky Sports.\n\n\"I think it's a great fight at the right time and me, my team and Rob [McCracken, also her Great Britain amateur coach] all believe in me. I'm just looking forward to it now, I want to bring big-time boxing back to Wales and this is just the start.\"\n\nPrice has an exceptional sporting pedigree. She played football for Cardiff and Wales, was a four-time world champion kickboxer, then threw her lot in with boxing a decade ago. As an amateur, the accomplishments mounted up with gold medals at the Commonwealth Games, European Games and World Championships, before topping the Olympic podium three years ago.\n\nThat triumph in Tokyo raised her profile immensely and she is quick to pay tribute to the backing she receives in Wales. \"We're a small country but we're a very proud nation, and when it comes to sport, we definitely support our own,\" she says. \"The BBC and all the Welsh channels, including S4C - even though I don't speak Welsh - back me, and I can't thank everyone enough for putting me out there. I've got the nation on my shoulders and flying the flag for Wales. It's been a dream of mine to box in Wales and to have this fight in Cardiff I'm just excited to put on a show for the fans.\"\n\nShe has certainly come a long way from driving a taxi to make ends meet in her late teens. \"I was only on like \u00a3100 a month, boxing for Wales, the funding wasn't great, my nan and grandad owned a taxi company in the valleys, and they got me a taxi. I worked for them on Friday and Saturday nights, picking up the drunks, dropping them back to Cardiff, and earning a few bob myself. That's not a job I intend to go back to.\"\n\nPrice has long hailed her grandmother Linda and her late grandfather Derek for nurturing her sporting abilities. \"They were just two amazing people that brought me up from three days old, loved me, told me to believe in my dreams, supported me, spent thousands of pounds on me around the world when I was competing in kickboxing and when I was playing football. If it wasn't for them I wouldn't have achieved anything in life... I feel like I was saved in a way... I was given a second chance and that's all down to my nan and my grandad, so everything in life I thank them for massively.\"\n\nLinda will not be in Cardiff on Saturday night - \"she never watches me fight, she gets so nervous\" - but she will have aunties, uncles and cousins present. The other key woman in Price's life is her partner Karriss Artingstall, also an Olympic medallist turned professional boxer. \"We're a couple, we support one another. The sport's hard enough as it is and I just feel lucky to have one another, especially in the pros. You need people around you that you trust. We understand one another, and know what we've got to go through mentally and physically.\n\n\"I'm also very proud of what she's achieved, her being in the Army, and her world and Olympic medals, it's pretty phenomenal. In our new house, hopefully we'll have a nice media wall so we can fill the shelves up with a few belts.\"\n\nVictory over 39-year-old McCaskill, who is in her 11th successive world title fight and has already faced modern greats Katie Taylor, Cecilia Braekhus and Chantelle Cameron, would get that display underway. \"Winning a world title will set me up for bigger fights. There's Sandy Ryan, Tasha Jonas... I want the big fights and at the minute, 147 [lbs] is the division, probably one of the best divisions out there for big fights, and I'm excited about it. This is the start of the journey, boxing in Wales, building my fanbase, and I just want to go on. The dream is to be boxing in the Principality Stadium against the top names, but I just have to take each fight as it comes. But I do want to create greatness.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gareth_a_davies@sports.yahoo.com", "name": "Gareth A

Preparing for the fight, and it was going to be on a Matchroom card. Cecilia backed out of the fight - she was supposed to fight Terri Harper - so my opponent got given away to someone else, so that mandatory didn't happen.\n\n\"Fast forward to now - she fought Harper and lost - she's still my mandatory, and we were making the fight, getting all the details and everything, and we were offered the Lauren Price fight and it just seemed like a better opportunity, so in order to take this fight I did have to vacate my WBC title. I believe Habazin got paid - but I just wanted to make sure that I was gonna fight top-quality people. I obviously love coming to the UK to fight in front of the fans, so this is the opportunity we decided on.\n\n\"I've always had to give up my belts. I was asked, when [in 2020] I was in the 140 class and was going to move up to 147 to fight Cecilia, to give up my belts by the WBA and the WBC. I gave up my WBA because I figured, 'The WBC [belt] is what everyone looks for'; the WBC then vacated me. No notice; just found out that Chantelle [Cameron] was fighting for my belts so then I had no belts. Then I vacated the WBO, which Sandy Ryan has - she had the chance to fight for that. Now I have to vacate the WBC. No one's ever taken a belt from me. I've vacated them. But those are like my babies - I don't like to give those up. It's disheartening.\n\n\"For it to be my first belt, and to have to give it away and to have it for so long, it is a sad thing. To figure out,\n\n'How am I going to go back and get that?'. You don't want those things to distract you. It's disheartening and it's a mind boggle because you want to get back and get it.\"\n\nMcCaskill, who has previously lost to Katie Taylor and Chantelle Cameron and twice beaten Braekhus, was then asked if the purse to fight Price is bigger than it would have been against Habazin, and she responded: \"Yes it is.\n\n\"I can't imagine Croatia getting packed out for a female fight.

The fight is in the Cardiff International Arena.\n\nA multi-time Golden Gloves winner following a late start in boxing, McCaskill lost against Katie Taylor for lightweight gold but would win the WBA and WBC super lightweight belts. In the streets of Oklahoma, McCaskill outworked trailblazer Cecilia Braekhus to become the undisputed welterweight champion.\n\n\"CasKILLA\" attempted to become undisputed at super lightweight, forcing the removal of several belts at 147. She lost against Cameron and, in an attempt to regain undisputed status, fought Sandy Ryan to a controversial draw. May believed Ryan won the contest. McCaskill now goes from an English fighter to facing a Welsh one.\n\n\"I don't know much about Price, but when it comes to fighters from the U.K., the expectation is usually lots of backpedaling and holding,\" McCaskill said. \"I don't know if this will be the case, but coming to Wales means Price is hopefully going to want to put on a good show. That's exactly what I want because I plan on doing the same. I'm here to steal all of her fans. I'm going to show her what it takes to be a champion, and the belts will be coming back to America with me.\"\n\nMORE: Who is the best female pound-for-pound in the world?\n\nPrice won gold in the 2020 Olympics. The former football player won the British welterweight title in 2023, a first for British women. The MBE-appointed fighter beat Silvia Bortot via points to secure a title shot.\n\n\"Jessica McCaskill is the current champion. She's game, experienced, and strong, but I'll be 100% ready for whatever she brings on the night. I believe in my ability,\" Price said. \"I back myself, and like I said earlier, I can't wait to bring those world titles back home to Wales, and hopefully, this will line me up to bring more massive nights back to Wales in the near future.\"\n\nHere's all you need to know about this fight, from time, channel, odds, card and more.\n\nJessica McCaskill vs. Lauren Price is on May 11.

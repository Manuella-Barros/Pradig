South Africa brought a case to the International Court of Justice late last year, accusing Israel of violating the genocide convention through its military operations in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected accusations of genocide and has argued that the war in Gaza is a legitimate defensive action against Hamas militants for their Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and in which 250 hostages were taken. If admitted to the case, the countries who joined would be able to make written submissions and speak at public hearings.

Fidan made the declaration during a Monday press conference with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty in Cairo, emphasizing Turkey's stance against the alleged acts of genocide by Israel.\n\nFidan said Turkey had decided to join the case initiated by South Africa, which accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, confirming that the formal submission would take place on Wednesday. This move follows Turkey's announcement in May that it would participate in the case, stepping up measures against Israel over its military actions in Gaza, which have resulted in nearly 40,000 deaths according to local health officials.\n\nThe ICJ, in response to South Africa's case, had earlier ordered Israel to refrain from actions that could be considered genocidal under the United Nations Genocide Convention. South Africa's legal action, initiated in December, claims that Israel's conduct in Gaza violates the 1948 Genocide Convention, established post-Holocaust to prevent such atrocities.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan indicated in January that Turkey was compiling documentation to support the case at the ICJ. Thirteen countries have either joined or expressed their intention to join South Africa's case against Israel. The ICJ allows states to intervene in cases to present their views.\n\nTurkey's decision to intervene follows criticism of its delayed response and accusations of negotiating with the United States, as expressed by Turkish opposition members like lawmaker \u00d6mer Faruk Gergerlio\u011flu.\n\nThe outcome of South Africa's case against Israel, along with Turkey's intervention, is expected to take years.\n\nAlthough President Erdo\u011fan uses strong rhetoric against Israel, accusing it of committing war crimes in Gaza, his government has faced criticism for not cutting off diplomatic and commercial relations with the country.\n\nAnkara announced it suspended all trade with Israel in May, but recent reports suggest that Turkey now disguises its exports to Israel by inflating figures on exports to Palestine, which surged 1,180 percent year-on-year in July.", "source": {"uri": "turkishminute.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "turkishminute.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua and Libya have also asked to join the case, as have Palestinian officials. The court's decision on their requests is still pending.\n\n\"We have just submitted our application to the International Court of Justice to intervene in the genocide case filed against Israel,\" Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan wrote on the social media platform X. \"Emboldened by the impunity for its crimes, Israel is killing more and more innocent Palestinians every day.\"\n\nInterim superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools left previous job under fire Letter: If Biden's age was so concerning, why isn't Trump's age?

In contrast to Western nations that have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization, Erdogan has commended the group, calling it a liberation movement.\n\nSouth Africa brought a case to the International Court of Justice late last year, accusing Israel of violating the genocide convention through its military operations in Gaza. In that case, the court called on Israel to do everything in its power to prevent genocide and recently ordered the country to \"ensure urgent humanitarian assistance\" in Gaza without delay.\n\nThe ICJ in May then ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive and demanded the release of hostages and the \"unhindered provision\" of humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nThe Hague-based ICJ, whose orders are legally binding but lack direct enforcement mechanisms, also instructed Israel to keep open the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza after Israel seized the Palestinian side in May, effectively shutting it.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly dismissed the rulings, insisting that the court had gotten it wrong and arguing in court that its operations in Gaza, which killed at least 39,000 Palestinians, are self-defense and targeted at Hamas, who attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nNicaragua, Colombia, Libya, Mexico, Spain and Palestinian officials have sought to join the case. The court's decision on their requests is still pending.\n\nIf admitted to the case, the countries could make written submissions and speak at public hearings.\n\nPreliminary hearings have already been held in the genocide case against Israel, but the court is expected to take years to reach a final decision.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye and Israel have experienced a volatile relationship since Erdo\u011fan took power in 2003, marked by periods of severe friction and reconciliation. The war in Gaza disrupted the most recent attempts at normalizing ties.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's document details Israel's attacks on the Gaza Strip, which surpass genocide and violate international law and all humanitarian rules, and cites T\u00fcrkiye's justifications for joining the case, Y\u00fcksel said Tuesday.\n\n\"The most important feature of T\u00fcrkiye's presentation is it complies with ICJ precedents and the court's advisory ruling regarding the occupation,\" Y\u00fcksel noted.\n\nThe ICJ, the highest legal body of the United Nations set up in 1945 to deal with disputes between states, in a landmark ruling on July 19, said that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is against international law.\n\n\"This compliance ensures the latest international law standards and perspectives are integrated into the court's deliberations. T\u00fcrkiye is therefore strengthening its legal arguments and submitting the most comprehensive application to the court so far,\" Y\u00fcksel added.\n\nArticles 62 and 63 of the Statute of the ICJ provide the necessary ground for T\u00fcrkiye to intervene in the genocide case against Israel. Participation through Article 62 is contingent on the court's permission, wherein states are expected to prove any legal interest that the case's outcome would particularly affect them.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's application is made under Article 63 of the Statute, which allows for a general declaration regarding the interpretation of the disputed treaty.\n\n\"Our declaration defines the obligations in articles 1, 2, and 3 of the genocide convention in addition to many other articles,\" Y\u00fcksel said.\n\nIt has the potential to influence the course of the case from several aspects since T\u00fcrkiye will be involved in the entire judicial process and will make a statement before the court regarding Israel's genocide.\n\nThe declaration is expected to be disclosed before the weekend.\n\nIsrael, as the defendant, could present a counter document objecting to T\u00fcrkiye's intervention.

Israeli media published reports suggesting that many Israelis were killed on that day by 'friendly fire'.\n\nGAZA LIVE BLOG: Evacuation Orders in Gaza | Shelling in Deir Al-Balah | 'Choosing Sinwar' - Day 306\n\nPalestinian and international organizations say that the majority of those killed and wounded are women and children.\n\nThe Israeli war has resulted in an acute famine, mostly in northern Gaza, resulting in the death of many Palestinians, mostly children.\n\nThe Israeli aggression has also resulted in the forceful displacement of nearly two million people from all over the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of the displaced forced into the densely crowded southern city of Rafah near the border with Egypt - in what has become Palestine's largest mass exodus since the 1948 Nakba.\n\nLater in the war, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians began moving from the south to central Gaza in a constant search for safety.", "source": {"uri": "palestinechronicle.com", "dataType":

In contrast to Western nations that have designated Hamas as a terrorist organization, Erdogan has commended the group, calling it a liberation movement.\n\nSouth Africa brought a case to the International Court of Justice late last year, accusing Israel of violating the genocide convention through its military operations in Gaza. In that case, the court called on Israel to do everything in its power to prevent genocide and recently ordered the country to \"ensure urgent humanitarian assistance\" in Gaza without delay.\n\nThe ICJ in May then ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive and demanded the release of hostages and the \"unhindered provision\" of humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nThe Hague-based ICJ, whose orders are legally binding but lack direct enforcement mechanisms, also instructed Israel to keep open the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza after Israel seized the Palestinian side in May, effectively shutting it.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly dismissed the rulings, insisting that the court had gotten it wrong and arguing in court that its operations in Gaza, which killed at least 39,000 Palestinians, are self-defense and targeted at Hamas, who attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nNicaragua, Colombia, Libya, Mexico, Spain and Palestinian officials have sought to join the case. The court's decision on their requests is still pending.\n\nIf admitted to the case, the countries could make written submissions and speak at public hearings.\n\nPreliminary hearings have already been held in the genocide case against Israel, but the court is expected to take years to reach a final decision.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye and Israel have experienced a volatile relationship since Erdo\u011fan took power in 2003, marked by periods of severe friction and reconciliation. The war in Gaza disrupted the most recent attempts at normalizing ties.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's document details Israel's attacks on the Gaza Strip, which surpass genocide and violate international law and all humanitarian rules, and cites T\u00fcrkiye's justifications for joining the case, Y\u00fcksel said Tuesday.\n\n\"The most important feature of T\u00fcrkiye's presentation is it complies with ICJ precedents and the court's advisory ruling regarding the occupation,\" Y\u00fcksel noted.\n\nThe ICJ, the highest legal body of the United Nations set up in 1945 to deal with disputes between states, in a landmark ruling on July 19, said that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is against international law.\n\n\"This compliance ensures the latest international law standards and perspectives are integrated into the court's deliberations. T\u00fcrkiye is therefore strengthening its legal arguments and submitting the most comprehensive application to the court so far,\" Y\u00fcksel added.\n\nArticles 62 and 63 of the Statute of the ICJ provide the necessary ground for T\u00fcrkiye to intervene in the genocide case against Israel. Participation through Article 62 is contingent on the court's permission, wherein states are expected to prove any legal interest that the case's outcome would particularly affect them.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's application is made under Article 63 of the Statute, which allows for a general declaration regarding the interpretation of the disputed treaty.\n\n\"Our declaration defines the obligations in articles 1, 2, and 3 of the genocide convention in addition to many other articles,\" Y\u00fcksel said.\n\nIt has the potential to influence the course of the case from several aspects since T\u00fcrkiye will be involved in the entire judicial process and will make a statement before the court regarding Israel's genocide.\n\nThe declaration is expected to be disclosed before the weekend.\n\nIsrael, as the defendant, could present a counter document objecting to T\u00fcrkiye's intervention.

submits declaration to top UN court to join South Africa's genocide case against Israel", "body": "Turkish move expected to be pivotal in genocide case against Israel, may encourage other countries in region to do the same\n\nT\u00fcrkiye on Wednesday submitted a declaration to the UN's highest court saying that it is joining South Africa's genocide case against Israel.\n\nThe Turkish delegation including Turkish Ambassador in The Hague Selcuk Unal and Justice and Development (AK) Party Istanbul lawmaker Cuneyt Yuksel submitted T\u00fcrkiye's file to the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\n\nT\u00fcrkiye thus became a party to the genocide case, joining Nicaragua, Colombia, Libya, Mexico, Palestine, and Spain, who have also joined South Africa, which first filed the case last December.\n\nAnkara's move is expected to be pivotal to the case, and is likely to encourage other countries in the region to join in as well.\n\nYuksel told reporters before submitting the file that T\u00fcrkiye has monitored the case very closely since the beginning.\n\nHe stressed that Israel has failed to implement previous ICJ provisional orders and acted without recognizing the law.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye will now \"directly intervene\" in the case, Yuksel vowed.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's file is expected to support South Africa's arguments and address how the Genocide Convention should be applied to Israel's actions in Gaza since last Oct. 7.\n\nFlouting a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire, Israel has faced international condemnation amid its continued offensive on Gaza since an Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Palestinian group Hamas.\n\nTen months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water, and medicine.\n\nIsrael has killed nearly 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza since Oct. 7, and is accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice for its military campaign.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the ICJ, whose latest ruling ordered Tel Aviv to immediately halt its military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.\n\nSouth Africa initiated the genocide case against Israel at the ICJ last Dec. 26, alleging that Tel Aviv was in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention due to its ongoing offensive on the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe ICJ responded by issuing provisional measures on Jan. 26, requiring Israel to take steps to prevent genocidal acts, including halting military actions, ensuring humanitarian aid access, and preserving evidence of violations.\n\nFollowing an additional request from South Africa, the ICJ on March 28 mandated Israel facilitate urgent humanitarian aid to Gaza, ensure Palestinian rights, and later report on the measures it had taken to implement this decision.\n\nOn May 24, the ICJ found earlier measures insufficient due to the dire humanitarian situation in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, ordering Israel to immediately cease military attacks, keep the Rafah border crossing open for aid, and allow UN investigators access to the Palestinian enclave.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ankara had previously said it would join the case filed by South Africa as a civil party.\n\nCneyt Yksel, a lawmaker from Erdoan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) and head of the Turkish parliament's legal committee, will lead a delegation to The Hague to deliver their petition to the international court.\n\nThis is a historic step, he told Anadolu Agency (AA) on Tuesday.\n\nIf our petition is accepted, Trkiye will participate in the judicial process and make statements about the Israeli genocide in Gaza, he said.\n\nTrkiye is a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause and continues diplomatic and legal efforts to resolve the conflict.\n\nA delegation of 15 Trkiye lawyers recently presented a dossier in The Hague documenting Israel's war crimes. They cited evidence obtained on the ground in Gaza, including notarized testimonies from wounded people, telephone interviews with civilians living there, and information provided by journalists currently stationed in the enclave who witnessed Israeli attacks first-hand.\n\nIn its case before the ICJ, South Africa accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. In that case, the court called on Israel to do everything in its power to prevent genocide and recently ordered the country to \"provide urgent humanitarian assistance\" to Gaza without delay.\n\nIn May, the ICJ ordered Israel to halt its offensive on Rafah and demanded the release of hostages and the \"unhindered delivery\" of humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nThe ICJ, whose rulings are legally binding but have no direct enforcement mechanisms, also ordered Israel to keep open the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza after Israel took control of the Palestinian side in May, effectively closing it.\n\nIsrael rejected the ruling, saying the court had made a mistake.\n\nYksel said the first step was taken by sending a note to the ICJ on May 31 stating its intention to join the case, adding that the process was the result of a long process. \"We put together our application file after legal and technical work and reviewing all the relevant articles of the 1948 UN Genocide Convention,\" he said.\n\nHe added that their application includes evidence of Israeli attacks on Gaza that violated international law and went beyond genocide.\n\nArticle 63 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice provides the necessary basis for our country to intervene in the genocide trial against Israel. According to this article, it is possible to make a general statement regarding the interpretation of the disputed treaty. We will file our application under Article 63 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. If our application is accepted, Turkey will be involved in the entire judicial process and will make a bold statement before the Court regarding the Israeli genocide in Gaza. In court, it will be possible to make statements on the interpretation of the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which serves as the basis for South Africa's complaint. This application is a historic step. With this request for intervention, Turkey will show the world, in the eyes of international law, that it supports the Palestinian cause and opposes the inhumane genocide in Gaza, Yksel said.\n\n\"Israel has committed and continues to commit crimes. They have opened a dark chapter in world history. We will support President Erdo\u011fan's just defense of the Palestinian cause and take legal measures in accordance with this position. Palestine will be free one day and Turkey will remain the voice of freedom forever,\" he added.\n\nTurkey is doing everything in its power to end the \"barbarity\" that has claimed the lives of 40,000 innocent people in Gaza over the past 10 months, President Erdo\u011fan said after a cabinet meeting in the capital Ankara on Monday.\n\n\"No matter what atrocities are committed by this bloody genocidal network, it will not stop Trkiye or the Turkish people from standing in solidarity with the Palestinians,\" he added.\n\nTurkey, with all its resources, stands with Palestine \"in these difficult days of struggle for its existence,\" he said.\n\nSaying that last week's assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh marked \"a new threshold in the Gaza crisis,\" Erdogan said \"the aggressive stance of the Netanyahu administration, defying both the rules and the law,\" is subjecting the region to disastrous scenarios.\n\n\"No encouraging results have emerged from the ceasefire negotiations. Despite Hamas' constructive stance, the Netanyahu administration has repeatedly demonstrated its intention to continue its policy of massacres,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com",

If allowed, the intervening state can take part in the proceedings, make statements, and submit evidence to the ICJ either as parties or non-parties to the trial.\n\nInterventions under this provision are recognized as a right of states that are party to the treaty in question. The court then allows or rejects the application after examining the form of the intervention.\n\nIf the declaration is deemed to meet the conditions of the article, the interpretation of the convention in the court's judgment is equally binding upon the intervening state.\n\nAlthough T\u00fcrkiye will apply under article 63, it reserves the right to intervene under article 62, as well.\n\nAt later stages of the case, Ankara may submit a new intervention request under article 62 or modify its statements and declaration under article 63.\n\nBy intervening in this case, states can guide the court's interpretation of the Genocide Convention and determination of genocide in Gaza, thereby exerting legal and political pressure on the court in identifying potential genocidal actions by Israel.\n\n- Purpose and evolving role of intervention\n\nThird countries had previously only intervened in cases that, while initiated between two other states, closely affected their interests, such as boundary disputes.\n\nHowever, in cases of global concern like genocide, intervention now provides states with a legal basis to act on matters that affect their own interests.\n\nAfter the ICJ accepted 32 of 33 intervention requests in Ukraine's case against Russia, this mechanism has been used more frequently to pressure accused states.\n\n- Importance of T\u00fcrkiye's intervention\n\nAnkara is expected to present a more detailed and comprehensive declaration compared to the other intervening states, potentially compelling the court to follow the ICJ advisory opinion of July 19 this year, which states that Israel has been unlawfully occupying Palestinian territories since 1967.\n\nConsidered alongside its other peace efforts in the region, T\u00fcrkiye's intervention may encourage neighboring countries to more actively participate in identifying violations of international law in Gaza and in defending Palestinian rights.\n\n- What will happen after T\u00fcrkiye's intervention notification?\n\nAfter T\u00fcrkiye submits its declaration of intervention, the court will request written observations from the parties involved, South Africa and Israel.\n\nIf deemed necessary, it may hold an oral hearing to determine the admissibility of the intervention.\n\nThe ICJ Registrar may also convey T\u00fcrkiye's intervention text to the UN secretary-general, UN member states, and other intervening countries.\n\nThe court will publish the intervention texts online unless decided otherwise, with T\u00fcrkiye's text expected by the end of the week.\n\n- At what stage is T\u00fcrkiye intervening in the case?\n\nThe ICJ is currently in the first phase of preliminary objections in the genocide case against Israel.\n\nIf it determines that the court has jurisdiction to hear the case on the genocide in Gaza, it will proceed to the second stage considering the merits of the case and issue its final decision.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye and the other intervening states will thus have submitted their declarations in the early stages of the case. This will allow them to participate in deliberations on the court's jurisdiction, in addition to the merits of the case.\n\n- When is the case expected to conclude?\n\nAlthough the ICJ has expedited proceedings in recent years, complex cases like genocide often take over a decade to resolve.\n\nFor instance, the Srebrenica genocide case took about 14 years, while a similar case concerning Croatia lasted for 16 years.\n\nProceedings in the ongoing genocide cases filed by Gambia and Ukraine suggest that the case against Israel might take seven to eight years to conclude.\n\n- South Africa's genocide case against Israel at ICJ\n\nThe ICJ responded by issuing provisional measures on Jan. 26, requiring Israel to take steps to prevent genocidal acts, including halting by military actions, ensuring humanitarian aid access, and preserving evidence of violations.\n\nFollowing an additional request from South Africa on March 6, the ICJ on March 28 mandated Israel facilitate urgent humanitarian aid to Gaza, ensure Palestinian rights, and later report on the measures it had taken to implement this decision.\n\nOn May 24, the ICJ found earlier measures insufficient due to the dire humanitarian situation in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, ordering Israel to immediately cease military attacks, keep the Rafah border crossing open for aid, and allow UN investigators access to the Palestinian enclave.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yeni \u015eafak"}, "authors": [{"uri": "piri_medya_a_s@yenisafak.com", "name": "Piri Medya A.\u015e.",

The ICJ may hold oral hearings to decide on the admissibility of the intervention. The parties can submit written observations, with Turkey retaining the right to respond.\n\nOther countries, including Nicaragua, Colombia, Libya, Mexico, Palestine and Spain, have also sought to intervene in the case. The ICJ has not yet ruled on these requests.\n\nArticle 63 has been used in previous ICJ cases. For instance, in Ukraine vs. Russia, the ICJ allowed 32 countries to intervene. Similarly, in Gambia vs. Myanmar, seven countries were permitted to intervene.\n\nThe case, initiated by South Africa on December 29, 2023, is ongoing. South Africa must submit its views by October 28, 2024, and Israel by July 28, 2025. Based on the ICJ's history, the process could take four to five years.\n\nTurkey's submission comes amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, with significant civilian casualties reported in Gaza.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Monday Turkey had decided to join the case initiated by South Africa, which accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, confirming that the formal submission would take place on Wednesday. This move follows Turkey's announcement in May that it would participate in the case, stepping up measures against Israel over its military actions in Gaza, which have resulted in nearly 40,000 deaths according to local health officials.\n\nThe ICJ, in response to South Africa's case, had earlier ordered Israel to refrain from actions that could be considered genocidal under the United Nations Genocide Convention. South Africa's legal action claims that Israel's conduct in Gaza violates the 1948 Genocide Convention, established post-Holocaust to prevent such atrocities.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan indicated in January that Turkey was compiling documentation to support the case at the ICJ. Thirteen countries have either joined or expressed their intention to join South Africa's case against Israel. The ICJ allows states to intervene in cases to present their views.\n\nTurkey's decision to intervene follows criticism of its delayed response and accusations of negotiating with the United States, as expressed by Turkish opposition members like lawmaker \u00d6mer Faruk Gergerlio\u011flu.\n\nAlthough President Erdo\u011fan uses strong rhetoric against Israel, accusing it of committing war crimes in Gaza, his government has faced criticism for not cutting off diplomatic and commercial relations with the country.\n\nAnkara announced it had suspended all trade with Israel in May, but recent reports suggest that Turkey now disguises its exports to Israel by inflating figures on exports to Palestine, which surged 1,180 percent year-on-year in July.", "source": {"uri": "turkishminute.com",

However, a final ruling on the case could take years.\n\nTurkey's move is the latest in a series of actions that have distanced Ankara from its previously healthy economic ties with Israel, and has frozen previously warming ties between the two countries.\n\nTurkish and Israeli officials have exchanged strong criticism on social media. This week Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called President Recep Tayyip Erdogan an \"anti-Semitic dictator\".\n\nThe Turkish leader has described Hamas members as \"freedom fighters\" and even normally reserved Turkish diplomats, including Mr Fidan, have traded barbed comments online with Israeli officials.\n\nIn May, Ankara banned trade with Israel, leading to a steep drop in business previously worth hundreds of millions of dollars every month.\n\nMass marches have taken place across Turkey in protest over the war in Gaza.

In contrast to Western nations that have designated Hamas as a terrorist organisation, Erdogan has commended the group, calling it a liberation movement.\n\nSouth Africa brought a case to the International Court of Justice late last year, accusing Israel of violating the genocide convention through its military operations in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has strongly rejected accusations of genocide and has argued that the war in Gaza is a legitimate defensive action against Hamas militants for their October 7 attack in southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and took 250 hostages.\n\nNicaragua, Colombia, Libya, Mexico, Spain and Palestinian officials have sought to join the case. The court's decision on their requests is still pending.\n\nIf admitted to the case, the countries would be able to make written submissions and speak at public hearings.\n\nPreliminary hearings have already been held in the genocide case against Israel, but the court is expected to take years to reach a final decision.\n\nKeceli, meanwhile, called for the immediate implementations of precautionary measures ordered by the court, including a halt to military offensive and an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nFormer allies Turkiye and Israel have experienced a volatile relationship since Erdogan took power in 2003, marked by periods of severe friction and reconciliation. The war in Gaza disrupted the most recent attempts at normalising ties.

Many countries including the Islamic Republic of Iran have expressed their support towards this aim,\" the top diplomat stated.\n\nSince Israel began its war against Gaza on October 7, which followed a successful Palestinian operation into the occupied territories, the humanitarian situation in the enclave has exponentially deteriorated. In the past 10 months, the regime has razed the entirety of Gaza to the ground, pummelled all medical facilities, and caused widespread famine and disease by blocking the entry of food, water, and medicine into the region.\n\n\"We want to hold accountable the Israeli leaders that have murdered women and children, destructed Gaza's civilian infrastructure, and decided to starve the people of Gaza,\" the South African Foreign Minister added.\n\nSouth Africa's case against Israel argues that the regime has violated the 1948 Genocide Convention, which was established in the aftermath of the Holocaust and requires all countries to prevent the recurrence of such crimes.\n\nSince October 7, more than 40,000 Gazans have lost their lives. A recent study published by a leading British medical journal estimated that the death toll could ultimately exceed 186,000 (approximately 9 percent of Gaza's population) due to the cumulative impact of Israel's ongoing offensive. The study also points out that the current death toll is probably higher, as thousands of dead buried under rubble have not been taken into account. The main victims of Israel's war in Gaza are women and children.\n\nIsrael's legal impunity granted by Western powers\n\nThe Israeli regime has been enjoying unwavering support from Washington and its European allies, which have disregarded their citizens' calls for holding Israel accountable for its crimes against humanity. The U.S. and Europe continue to send weapons to Israel, and some have gone out of their way to make sure the regime would not face any legal reprisals.\n\nIn the United States, it was revealed that more than a dozen American senators have warned International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutors of potential sanctions against them and their families should they choose to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some of his ministers.\n\nIn Europe, many countries have banned a British-Palestinian doctor's entry into their territories, with France keeping him at a holding zone in the airport for several hours before expelling him. Ghassan Abu-Sitta, who was scheduled to make a speech at the French Senate, spent 43 days in Gaza, helping treat those wounded in Israel's war.\n\nBefore he was expelled from France in May, Abu-Sitta was also denied entry into Germany, where he was detained and questioned for several hours. The Palestinian doctor is one of the potential witnesses of Israel's genocide in the enclave.\n\nIn their most recent attempt to insulate Israel against legal action, Western states reportedly tried to block an ICJ ruling which determined in June that the regime's ongoing presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is illegal and should be promptly terminated.\n\nThe UK, for instance, submitted a 43-page legal opinion to the top UN Court which opposed the hearing of the case on Israel's occupation of Palestine altogether.\n\nWhile the ICJ has not yet rendered a final decision on the case brought by South Africa, analysts and legal experts anticipate that UN prosecutors will face significant challenges in delivering a fair ruling, given the pressure from Western states to overlook Israeli crimes.", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tehran Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type":

But the judges stopped short of explicitly ordering a halt to the Israeli offensive.\n\nIn March, the court again ruled that Israel must ensure that basic food supplies reach people in Gaza without delay as starvation deepened in the territory amid the Israeli blockade.\n\nTwo months later, the ICJ ordered Israel to \"immediately halt its military offensive\" in Rafah where most of Gaza's displaced population was sheltering. The Israeli government ignored the ruling.\n\nThe ICJ's decisions are binding, but there is no established mechanism to enforce them. The UN Security Council (UNSC) can pass resolutions to impose sanctions against parties that violate the court's decisions, but moves against Israel at the UNSC have often been blocked by the veto power of the United States.\n\nIn a separate case last month, the ICJ declared in an advisory opinion that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and must end \"as rapidly as possible\".\n\nThe Turkish intervention in the genocide case comes amid an intensifying war of words between Israel and Turkey over Israeli atrocities in Gaza.\n\nIn July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested that Turkey might \"enter\" the conflict to help Palestinians, drawing outrage from Israeli officials - particularly the country's Foreign Minister Israel Katz.\n\nLast week, Katz slammed Erdogan and accused him of turning Turkey into a \"dictatorship\".\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry said earlier this week that Katz has been spreading \"lies\" about Turkey and its president.\n\n\"For some time now, the person in question cannot be taken seriously,\" it said in a statement, adding that Ankara \"will continue to support the Palestinians in the strongest possible way\".", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score":

If allowed, the intervening state can take part in the proceedings, make statements, and submit evidence to the ICJ either as parties or non-parties to the trial.\n\nJoining a case under article 63, meanwhile, allows states to participate in the interpretation of a treaty, in this case the 1948 Genocide Convention, related to the court proceedings, rather than on the substantive facts of the dispute.\n\nInterventions under this provision are recognized as a right of states that are party to the treaty in question. The court then allows or rejects the application after examining the form of the intervention.\n\nIf the declaration is deemed to meet the conditions of the article, the interpretation of the convention in the court's judgment is equally binding upon the intervening state.\n\nAmong the countries intervening in South Africa's genocide case against Israel, only Nicaragua has done so under article 62 alone, while Palestine has joined the case under both articles. Colombia, Libya, Mexico, and Spain intervened only under article 63.\n\nAlthough T\u00fcrkiye will apply under article 63, it reserves the right to intervene under article 62, as well.\n\nAt later stages of the case, Ankara may submit a new intervention request under article 62 or modify its statements and declaration under article 63.\n\nBy intervening in this case, states can guide the court's interpretation of the Genocide Convention and determination of genocide in Gaza, thereby exerting legal and political pressure on the court in identifying potential genocidal actions by Israel.\n\nPurpose and evolving role of intervention\n\nState interventions in the ICJ have been rare, but gained new significance in recent years as a way for countries to support applicant nations, particularly after the Rohingya genocide case that Gambia filed against Myanmar in 2019, as well as Ukraine's genocide case against Russia in 2022.\n\nThird countries had previously only intervened in cases that, while initiated between two other states, closely affected their interests, such as boundary disputes.\n\nHowever, in cases of global concern like genocide, intervention now provides states with a legal basis to act on matters that affect their own interests.\n\nAfter the ICJ accepted 32 of 33 intervention requests in Ukraine's case against Russia, this mechanism has been used more frequently to pressure accused states.\n\nImportance of T\u00fcrkiye's intervention\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's intervention in the genocide case against Israel reaffirms its legal and moral responsibilities on the global stage.\n\nAnkara is expected to present a more detailed and comprehensive declaration compared to the other intervening states, potentially compelling the court to follow the ICJ advisory opinion of July 19 this year, which states that Israel has been unlawfully occupying Palestinian territories since 1967.\n\nConsidered alongside its other peace efforts in the region, T\u00fcrkiye's intervention may encourage neighboring countries to more actively participate in identifying violations of international law in Gaza and in defending Palestinian rights.\n\nAdditionally, interpretations of the Genocide Convention by a powerful regional actor like T\u00fcrkiye have the potential to significantly influence the deliberations of ICJ judges, as well as the outcomes of both this genocide case and others that may come in the future.\n\nWhat will happen after T\u00fcrkiye's intervention notification?\n\nAfter T\u00fcrkiye submits its declaration of intervention, the court will request written observations from the parties involved, South Africa and Israel.\n\nIf deemed necessary, it may hold an oral hearing to determine the admissibility of the intervention.\n\nThe ICJ Registrar may also convey T\u00fcrkiye's intervention text to the UN secretary-general, UN member states, and other intervening countries.\n\nThe court will publish the intervention texts online unless decided otherwise, with T\u00fcrkiye's text expected by the end of the week.\n\nWhile Israel, as a party to the case, may submit written observations opposing T\u00fcrkiye's intervention, Ankara can provide written counter-observations. The ICJ typically issues decisions on interventions by multiple countries in a single ruling.\n\nAt what stage is T\u00fcrkiye intervening in the case?\n\nThe ICJ is currently in the first phase of preliminary objections in the genocide case against Israel.\n\nIf it determines that the court has jurisdiction to hear the case on the genocide in Gaza, it will proceed to the second stage considering the merits of the case and issue its final decision.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye and the other intervening states will thus have submitted their declarations in the early stages of the case. This will allow them to participate in deliberations on the court's jurisdiction, in addition to the merits of the case.\n\nInterventions are allowed until the submission deadline of the second phase.\n\nWhen is the case expected to conclude?\n\nAlthough the ICJ has expedited proceedings in recent years, complex cases like genocide often take over a decade to resolve.\n\nFor instance, the Srebrenica genocide case took about 14 years, while a similar case concerning Croatia lasted for 16 years.\n\nProceedings in the ongoing genocide cases filed by Gambia and Ukraine suggest that the case against Israel might take seven to eight years to conclude.\n\nSouth Africa's genocide case against Israel at ICJ\n\nSouth Africa initiated the genocide case against Israel at the ICJ on Dec. 26 last year, alleging that Tel Aviv was in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention due to its ongoing brutal offensive on the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe ICJ responded by issuing provisional measures on Jan. 26, requiring Israel to take steps to prevent genocidal acts, including halting by military actions, ensuring humanitarian aid access, and preserving evidence of violations.\n\nFollowing an additional request from South Africa on March 6, the ICJ on March 28 mandated Israel facilitate urgent humanitarian aid to Gaza, ensure Palestinian rights, and later report on the measures it had taken to implement this decision.\n\nOn May 24, the ICJ found earlier measures insufficient due to the dire humanitarian situation in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, ordering Israel to immediately cease military attacks, keep the Rafah border crossing open for aid, and allow UN investigators access to the Palestinian enclave.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu

T\u00fcrkiye will make every effort on this path.\"\n\nTurkish diplomatic sources said Turkey's declaration of intervention at the ICJ is based on Article 63 of the court's statute, which allows any state to intervene once another is believed to violate the 1948 UN Convention on Genocide.\n\n\"As a signatory of the 1948 Genocide Convention, Turkey is bound by international law to prevent and punish acts of genocide,\" one of the sources said.\n\n\"Turkey's intervention underscores its commitment to these obligations and sets a precedent for other nations to address serious humanitarian crises similarly.\"\n\nNicaragua, Colombia, Libya, Mexico, Palestine and Spain have all previously submitted interventions in the case. However, Turkish officials claim Ankara's application is the most comprehensive and well-founded to this date.\n\nOne distinctive feature of the Turkish application is its alignment with the ICJ's recent advisory on the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, which Turkey believes strengthens its legal arguments.\n\nSince May, Turkish officials have encouraged many other states in the region to join the case, but surprised some with the length of time it took to do so itself.\n\nSources familiar with the issue told Middle East Eye earlier this year that this was the first time Ankara has ever had to make such an application, and it needed a detailed counsel to bring it forward.\n\nThe internal deliberations included possible future issues, such as Armenia filing a genocide case against Turkey over the mass killing of Armenians in 1915, long before the foundation of the modern republic.\n\nTurkey's main opposition, the Republican People's Party (CHP), warned the government over such possibilities in May.\n\nOther CHP officials believe Article 63 could give the same judicial powers to other states, which may sue Turkey on similar charges.\n\nSoon after Ankara declared its intention to intervene, Erdogan Toprak, a CHP member of parliament from Istanbul, said Jewish communities in the West could cooperate with the Greek and Armenian diaspora to file genocide cases against Turkey at the ICJ.\n\nThe Hague-based court is yet to make a decision on the intervention applications by other states. The Turkish diplomats believe the overall conclusion of the judicial proceedings will take four to five years.\n\nThe court has set 28 October as the deadline for South Africa to submit its written arguments and 28 July 2025 for Israel to do the same.\n\n\"This intervention not only addresses the immediate crisis in Gaza but also strengthens the global legal framework for handling similar situations in the future,\" a Turkish diplomatic source said.", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle East Eye"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

evaluations regarding the possibilities of intervention, it recalled.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye on Wednesday submitted a declaration to the UN's highest court, saying that it is joining South Africa's genocide case against Israel.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye thus became a party to the genocide case, joining Nicaragua, Colombia, Libya, Mexico, Palestine, and Spain, who have also joined South Africa, which first filed the case last December.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's file is expected to support South Africa's arguments and address how the Genocide Convention should be applied to Israel's actions in Gaza since last Oct. 7.\n\nFlouting a UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate cease-fire, Israel has faced international condemnation amid its continued offensive on Gaza since an Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Palestinian group Hamas.\n\nTen months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water, and medicine.\n\nIsrael has killed nearly 40,000

At the end of July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan threatened to send NATO troops into Israel to intervene.\n\nErdo\u011fan also blamed Israel for the \"treacherous assassination\" of top Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week.\n\n\"The path to peace in the Middle East is through the establishment of a real Palestinian state.\" Turkey's foreign minister said at Monday's press conference. \"Our brothers and sisters should have an independent, sovereign and geographically integrated state with East Jerusalem as its capital.

Israel has killed around 40,000 civilians, mostly women and children, in its attacks since October 2023 and left around 2 million Palestinians without proper food, shelter and other basic needs.\n\nKe\u00e7eli recalled that the ICJ has already ruled that Israel must stop its offensive against Gaza and humanitarian aid must be delivered through Rafah, calling on the U.N. Security Council to do its part in light of this ruling.\n\nAccording to diplomatic sources, T\u00fcrkiye's declaration of intervention is the most detailed, substantial and well-defended declaration among the other applicant countries. T\u00fcrkiye declared its intention to join the case in early May. Sources underline that T\u00fcrkiye submitted its file after lengthy and meticulous legal work.\n\n\"T\u00fcrkiye's meticulous approach provides the ICJ with a solid legal framework to correctly interpret the Genocide Convention. T\u00fcrkiye's submission identifies obligations under articles 1, 2 and 3 of the Convention and highlights the need for appropriate measures to investigate and prosecute acts of genocide,\" sources said.\n\nIn a landmark opinion in January 2024, the ICJ declared that Israel's occupation and annexation of the Palestinian territories are unlawful, and its discriminatory laws and policies against Palestinians violate the prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid.\n\nAccording to the sources, T\u00fcrkiye's declaration of intervention is in line with the ICJ opinion, and thus strengthens T\u00fcrkiye's legal arguments concerning the case.\n\n\"The detailed legal arguments and comprehensive analysis submitted by T\u00fcrkiye can serve as valuable references for future cases and contribute to the development of international humanitarian law. This intervention not only addresses the immediate crisis in Gaza, but also strengthens the global legal framework for addressing similar situations in the future,\" sources recalled.\n\nOne of the reasons why Israel commits war crimes, crimes against humanity and acts of genocide so recklessly is the perception of impunity in Israel and in the world, sources stressed.\n\nThis perception can be eliminated only if the global system swiftly acts to punish Israel and other countries committing such crimes following the decisions taken by international courts such as the ICJ and International Criminal Court, sources said.\n\n\"T\u00fcrkiye's intervention is a serious step against Israel's attitude that defies the entire international community and the law,\" they added.\n\nThe ICJ will ask Israel and South Africa to submit their opinions about T\u00fcrkiye's bid to join the case.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hurriyet Daily News"}, "authors":

in what has become Palestine's largest mass exodus since the 1948 Nakba.", "source": {"uri": "wafa.ps", "dataType": "news", "title": "WAFA Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ankara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ankara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Sweden)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anadolu_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anadolu Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicaragua"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nicaragua"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Libya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Libya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nakba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792675", "eventUri": "eng-9792675", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1438, "textEnd": 1447}, {"amb": false, "date": "2007-08-", "textStart": 19, "textEnd": 28}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

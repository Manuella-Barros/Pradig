{"id": 231994736, "title": "The hidden catalyst behind the rise of the radical right in Europe\u2019s depopulating regions", "text": "The political leanings of voters in depopulating regions also changed, from center-left to populist right. Here, emigration played a key role. As communities lose more and more of their working-age population, they experience a decline in public services \u2013 due both to dwindling numbers and a shrinking tax base. As a result, schools and hospitals are shuttered, public transportation is cut and local businesses close. Along with these quality-of-life declines, living in a place that so many people choose to leave generates a sense of status loss among those who stay. Our interviews with Social Democratic Party leaders revealed how local mayors felt they had to contend with a \u201ccollective depression.\u201d One mayor noted: \u201cWe like it here. But then someone comes from the outside and says that you\u2019re a failure if you live here \u2026 so we are struggling against the public perception of what constitutes a successful individual. We constantly have to work on the psychology of the municipality\u2019s inhabitants.\u201d Meanwhile, disillusionment with established parties provides fertile ground for radical right parties to exploit. Quality-of-life declines While centrist politicians may feel compelled to adopt anti-immigrant stances in response, copying the rhetoric of radical right parties risks alienating their base. Further, we believe cracking down on immigration is likely to prove an ineffective political strategy in the long run. The Sweden Democrats\u2019 success in depopulating regions is in part a protest against the political establishment. But once in office, and without clear solutions to the local economic and quality-of-life declines that emigration has set in motion, party officials will likely face the same voter discontent fueling their current success. Ironically, the forces that have increased the appeal of the far right\u2019s anti-immigrant ideologies \u2013 falling birth rates, labor shortages and a lack of new businesses and services \u2013 are most feasibly addressed by increasing immigration. By following the right\u2019s lead to tighten borders, parties closer to the center may condemn industrialized nations to a political doom loop. Instead, centrist parties may find it pays more dividends to focus attention on addressing the root causes of population decline and restoring public services in peripheral areas. There are some examples of this already happening. During recent years, Swedish governments have introduced and gradually expanded a national support system for local commercial services, such as grocery stores, in vulnerable and remote locations. In 2021, Spain announced a US$11.9 billion plan aimed at addressing the lack of 5G telephone connectivity and technologically smart cities in rural areas. Meanwhile, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development is putting over $100 billion toward efforts to support rural areas in its 2021-2027 budget. Such moves may counter a somewhat paradoxical trend that has seen fiercely anti-immigrant parties gaining ground in places least affected by immigration. Either way, as parties in Europe and the U.S. prepare for crucial elections this year, understanding the complex interplay of demographic shifts and political dynamics is critical. As is acknowledging that emigration, often overshadowed by immigration rhetoric, is a key factor shaping the rise of the radical right.

(the \"Company\" or \"GSilver\") (TSXV:GSVR) is pleased to announce the closing of its previously announced brokered, best-efforts offering (\"Offering\") for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of C$11,350,460 under a combined Listed Issuer Financing Exemption private placement under Part 5A of National Instrument 45-106 - Prospectus Exemptions (the \"LIFE Exemption\") and concurrent private placement to accredited investors (the \"Private Placement\"). The Offering consisted of units of the Company (the \"Units\") at a price of C$0.20 per Unit (the \"Offering Price\"). The Offering was led by Research Capital Corporation and Red Cloud Securities Inc. as the co-lead agents and joint bookrunners, on behalf of a syndicate of agents, including Canaccord Genuity Corp. (collectively, the \"Agents\").\n\nEach Unit consists of one common share of the Company (\"Common Share\") and one Common Share purchase warrant (a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase an additional Common Share at an exercise price of C$0.30, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, until May 9, 2026.\n\nNet proceeds from the Offering will be used to, inter alia:\n\nAs part of the Offering, 43,125,000 Units (\"LIFE Units\") were sold to purchasers pursuant to the LIFE Exemption in all provinces of Canada, except Quebec, and other qualifying jurisdictions, including the United States. In addition, 13,627,300 Units (the \"Accredited Investor Units\") were sold to accredited investors under the accredited investor exemption contained in National Instrument 45-106 - Prospectus Exemptions in all provinces of Canada, and other qualifying jurisdictions, including the United Statespursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the \"1933 Act\"), and applicable U.S. state securities laws. The securities underlying the LIFE Units are not subject to a statutory hold period under applicable Canadian securities laws. Unless permitted under securities legislation, the securities underlying the Accredited Investor Units cannot be traded before September 10, 2024.\n\nIn connection with the Offering, the Agents received a cash commission of $525,982, a cash advisory fee of $48,000 and 2,889,388 non-transferable broker warrants (the \"Broker Warrants\"). Each Broker Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price equal to the Offering Price, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, until May 9, 2026.\n\nTo demonstrate continued support of the Company, certain directors, officers and other insiders of the Company and their affiliates (each, a \"Related Party\") participated in the Offering and acquired an aggregate of 2,515,000 Units for total gross proceeds of $503,000. Each subscription by a Related Party is considered a \"related party transaction\" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"). The related party transactions are exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements under MI 61-101 in reliance upon the exemptions contained in Sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, respectively, as the fair market value of the transaction, insofar as it involves the Related Parties, does not exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization. The Company did not file a material change report related to Offering more than 21 days before the expected closing of the Offering as required by MI 61-101 since the details of the participation by the Related Parties were not settled until shortly prior to the closing of the Offering and the Company wished to close on an expedited basis for sound business reasons.\n\nThis new release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States.

The Company produces silver and gold concentrates from the El Cubo Mine Complex, Valenciana Mines Complex, and the San Ignacio mine; all three mines are located within the state of Guanajuato, which has an established 480-year mining history. Additionally, the Company produces silver, gold, lead, and zinc concentrates from the Topia mine in northwestern Durango. With four operating mines and three processing facilities, GSilver is one of the fastest growing silver producers in Mexico.\n\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n\"James Anderson\"\n\nChairman and CEO\n\nFor further information regarding Guanajuato Silver Company Ltd., please contact:\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.\n\nForward-Looking Statements and Information\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements and information, which relate to future events or future performance including, but not limited to the intended use of proceeds from the Offering, final TSX Venture Exchange approval for the Offering, the Company's future development and production activities and opportunities for future exploration, development and production and the estimated timing and costs thereof; and the status of the Company as one of the fastest growing silver producers in Mexico.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements and information reflect management's current beliefs and expectations and are based on information currently available to and assumptions made by the Company; which assumptions, while considered reasonable by the Company, are inherently subject to significant operational, business, market, economic and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies. These assumptions include: our mineral resource estimates at El Cubo, El Pinguico and San Ignacio and the assumptions upon which they are based, including geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics of rock conforming to sampled results and metallurgical performance; available tonnage of mineralized material to be mined and processed; resource grades and recoveries; assumptions and discount rates being appropriately applied to production estimates; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate production from San Ignacio and Valenciana into the Company's existing mining and milling operations at El Cubo and the availability of excess processing and tailings capacity at El Cubo to accommodate same; the Company's ability to secure additional sources of mineralized material for processing, prices for silver, gold and other metals remaining as estimated; currency exchange rates remaining as estimated; availability of funds for the Company's projects and to satisfy current liabilities and obligations including debt repayments, capital expenditures, decommissioning and reclamation estimates; prices for energy inputs, labour, materials, supplies and services (including transportation) and inflation rates remaining as estimated; no labour-related disruptions; no unplanned delays or interruptions in scheduled construction and production; all necessary permits, licenses and regulatory approvals are received in a timely manner; and the ability to comply with environmental, health and safety laws. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive.\n\nReaders are cautioned that such forward-looking statements and information are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that may cause actual future results, level of activity, production levels, performance or achievements of GSilver to differ materially from those expected including, but not limited to, market conditions, availability of financing, future prices of gold, silver and other metals, currency rate fluctuations, actual results of exploration, development and production activities, actual resource grades and recoveries of silver, gold and other metals, availability of third party mineralized material for processing, rising inflation and interest rates, geopolitical conflicts including wars, unanticipated geological or structural formations and characteristics, environmental risks, operating risks, accidents, labor issues, equipment or personnel delays, delays in obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals and permits, inadequate insurance, and other risks in the mining industry. There are no assurances that the Company will successfully complete the Offering in whole or in part on the terms and in accordance with the timing set out herein. Further, there are no assurances that GSilver will be able to continue to increase production, tonnage milled and recoveries rates, improve grades and reduce costs at its existing mines to process mineralized materials to produce silver, gold and other concentrates in the amounts, grades, recoveries, costs and timetable anticipated. GSilver's decision to process mineralized material from its mining projects is not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability and therefore is subject to increased uncertainty and risk of failure, both economically and technically. Mineral resources and mineralized material that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability, are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them, and may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, and other relevant issues. There are no assurances that the Company's projected production of silver, gold and other metals will be realized. In addition, there are no assurances that the Company will meet its production forecasts or generate the anticipated cash flows from operations to satisfy its scheduled debt payments or other liabilities when due or meet financial covenants to which the Company is subject or to fund its exploration programs and corporate initiatives as planned. There is also uncertainty about the impact of any resurgence of COVID-19, the ongoing war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza, and higher inflation and interest rates and the impact they will have on the Company's operations, supply chains, ability to access mining projects or procure equipment, supplies, contractors and other personnel on a timely basis or at all and economic activity in general. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements or information. All forward-looking statements and information made in this news release are qualified by these cautionary statements and those in our continuous disclosure filings available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca including the Company's most recently filed annual information form. These forward-looking statements and information are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances save as required by law.", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StreetInsider.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accredited_investor",

These assumptions include: our mineral resource estimates at El Cubo, El Pinguico and San Ignacio and the assumptions upon which they are based, including geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics of rock conforming to sampled results and metallurgical performance; available tonnage of mineralized material to be mined and processed; resource grades and recoveries; assumptions and discount rates being appropriately applied to production estimates; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate production from San Ignacio and Valenciana into the Company's existing mining and milling operations at El Cubo and the availability of excess processing and tailings capacity at El Cubo to accommodate same; the Company's ability to secure additional sources of mineralized material for processing, prices for silver, gold and other metals remaining as estimated; currency exchange rates remaining as estimated; availability of funds for the Company's projects and to satisfy current liabilities and obligations including debt repayments, capital expenditures, decommissioning and reclamation estimates; prices for energy inputs, labour, materials, supplies and services (including transportation) and inflation rates remaining as estimated; no labour-related disruptions; no unplanned delays or interruptions in scheduled construction and production; all necessary permits, licenses and regulatory approvals are received in a timely manner; and the ability to comply with environmental, health and safety laws. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive.\n\nReaders are cautioned that such forward-looking statements and information are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that may cause actual future results, level of activity, production levels, performance or achievements of GSilver to differ materially from those expected including, but not limited to, market conditions, availability of financing, future prices of gold, silver and other metals, currency rate fluctuations, actual results of exploration, development and production activities, actual resource grades and recoveries of silver, gold and other metals, availability of third party mineralized material for processing, rising inflation and interest rates, geopolitical conflicts including wars, unanticipated geological or structural formations and characteristics, environmental risks, operating risks, accidents, labor issues, equipment or personnel delays, delays in obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals and permits, inadequate insurance, and other risks in the mining industry. There are no assurances that the Company will successfully complete the Offering in whole or in part on the terms and in accordance with the timing set out herein. Further, there are no assurances that GSilver will be able to continue to increase production, tonnage milled and recoveries rates, improve grades and reduce costs at its existing mines to process mineralized materials to produce silver, gold and other concentrates in the amounts, grades, recoveries, costs and timetable anticipated. GSilver's decision to process mineralized material from its mining projects is not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability and therefore is subject to increased uncertainty and risk of failure, both economically and technically. Mineral resources and mineralized material that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability, are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them, and may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, and other relevant issues. There are no assurances that the Company's projected production of silver, gold and other metals will be realized. In addition, there are no assurances that the Company will meet its production forecasts or generate the anticipated cash flows from operations to satisfy its scheduled debt payments or other liabilities when due or meet financial covenants to which the Company is subject or to fund its exploration programs and corporate initiatives as planned. There is also uncertainty about the impact of any resurgence of COVID-19, the ongoing war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza, and higher inflation and interest rates and the impact they will have on the Company's operations, supply chains, ability to access mining projects or procure equipment, supplies, contractors and other personnel on a timely basis or at all and economic activity in general. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements or information. All forward-looking statements and information made in this news release are qualified by these cautionary statements and those in our continuous disclosure filings available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca including the Company's most recently filed annual information form. These forward-looking statements and information are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances save as

In addition, 13,627,300 Units (the \"Accredited Investor Units\") were sold to accredited investors under the accredited investor exemption contained in National Instrument 45-106 - Prospectus Exemptions in all provinces of Canada, and other qualifying jurisdictions, including the United Statespursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the \"1933 Act\"), and applicable U.S. state securities laws.

These assumptions include: our mineral resource estimates at El Cubo, El Pinguico and San Ignacio and the assumptions upon which they are based, including geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics of rock conforming to sampled results and metallurgical performance; available tonnage of mineralized material to be mined and processed; resource grades and recoveries; assumptions and discount rates being appropriately applied to production estimates; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate production from San Ignacio and Valenciana into the Company's existing mining and milling operations at El Cubo and the availability of excess processing and tailings capacity at El Cubo to accommodate same; the Company's ability to secure additional sources of mineralized material for processing, prices for silver, gold and other metals remaining as estimated; currency exchange rates remaining as estimated; availability of funds for the Company's projects and to satisfy current liabilities and obligations including debt repayments, capital expenditures, decommissioning and reclamation estimates; prices for energy inputs, labour, materials, supplies and services (including transportation) and inflation rates remaining as estimated; no labour-related disruptions; no unplanned delays or interruptions in scheduled construction and production; all necessary permits, licenses and regulatory approvals are received in a timely manner; and the ability to comply with environmental, health and safety laws. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive.\n\nReaders are cautioned that such forward-looking statements and information are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that may cause actual future results, level of activity, production levels, performance or achievements of GSilver to differ materially from those expected including, but not limited to, market conditions, availability of financing, future prices of gold, silver and other metals, currency rate fluctuations, actual results of exploration, development and production activities, actual resource grades and recoveries of silver, gold and other metals, availability of third party mineralized material for processing, rising inflation and interest rates, geopolitical conflicts including wars, unanticipated geological or structural formations and characteristics, environmental risks, operating risks, accidents, labor issues, equipment or personnel delays, delays in obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals and permits, inadequate insurance, and other risks in the mining industry. There are no assurances that the Company will successfully complete the Offering in whole or in part on the terms and in accordance with the timing set out herein. Further, there are no assurances that GSilver will be able to continue to increase production, tonnage milled and recoveries rates, improve grades and reduce costs at its existing mines to process mineralized materials to produce silver, gold and other concentrates in the amounts, grades, recoveries, costs and timetable anticipated. GSilver's decision to process mineralized material from its mining projects is not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability and therefore is subject to increased uncertainty and risk of failure, both economically and technically. Mineral resources and mineralized material that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability, are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them, and may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, and other relevant issues. There are no assurances that the Company's projected production of silver, gold and other metals will be realized. In addition, there are no assurances that the Company will meet its production forecasts or generate the anticipated cash flows from operations to satisfy its scheduled debt payments or other liabilities when due or meet financial covenants to which the Company is subject or to fund its exploration programs and corporate initiatives as planned. There is also uncertainty about the impact of any resurgence of COVID-19, the ongoing war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza, and higher inflation and interest rates and the impact they will have on the Company's operations, supply chains, ability to access mining projects or procure equipment, supplies, contractors and other personnel on a timely basis or at all and economic activity in general. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements or information. All forward-looking statements and information made in this news release are qualified by these cautionary statements and those in our continuous disclosure filings available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca including the Company's most recently filed annual information form. These forward-looking statements and information are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances save as required by law.\n\nSOURCE: Guanajuato Silver Company Ltd.\n\nView the original\n\npress release\n\non accesswire.com", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

(CSE: MAXX; OTC: MAXXF; FRANKFURT: 89N) (\"MAX Power\" or the \"Company\") reports that it has updated the terms of its non-brokered private placement (originally announced on May 3, 2024 and increased on May 7, 2024). The Company has now set a minimum for the offering (the \"Offering\") of 9,745,744 units (the \"Units\") at a price of $0.195 per Unit (the \"Offering Price\") for minimum gross proceeds to MAX Power of $1,900,420 (the \"Offering\"). The Company intends to close the Offering for gross proceeds $1,900,420.\n\nThe Offering is scheduled to close on or about May 15, 2024 (the \"Closing Date\") and completion of the Offering is subject to certain conditions including the receipt of all necessary approvals, including the approval of the Canadian Securities Exchange (\"CSE\"). The Company has posted an amended and restated offering document (the \"Offering Document\") at www.sedarplus.ca and on the Company's website at www.MaxPowerMining.com.\n\nPrivate Placement Terms\n\nEach Unit will consist of one common share in the capital of the Company (a \"Share\") and one-half of one non-transferable common share purchase warrant (each whole common share purchase warrant, a \"Warrant\"). Each whole Warrant will be exercisable to acquire one Share at an exercise price of $0.30 per Share for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance, subject to an acceleration clause described in this news release.\n\nUse of Proceeds\n\nThe Company plans to use the net proceeds of this financing for exploration, evaluation of new resource projects, general and administrative expenses which will include funds for marketing and investor relations fees and cash for working capital.\n\nAcceleration Clause\n\nIf at any time after the date of issuance of the Warrant, the closing price of the Company's common shares on the CSE (or such other stock exchange on which the common shares may be traded from time to time) is at or above $0.50 (CDN) per share for a period of 10 consecutive trading days (the \"Triggering Event\"), the Company may, within 5 days of the Triggering Event, accelerate the expiry date of the Warrants by giving notice thereof to the holders of the Warrants, by way of news release, and in such case the Warrants will expire on the first day that is 30 calendar days after the date on which such notice is given by the Company announcing the Triggering Event and all rights of holders of such Warrants shall be terminated without any compensation to such holder.\n\nAdditional Details\n\nSubject to compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and in accordance with National Instrument 45-106 - Prospectus Exemptions (\"NI 45-106\"), the Offering is being made to purchasers who are residents in each of the Provinces of Canada, except Quebec, pursuant to the listed issuer financing exemption under Part 5A of NI 45-106 (the \"Exemption\"). The securities offered under the Exemption will not be subject to a hold period in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws.\n\nThere is an amended and restated offering document (the \"Offering Document\") related to the Offering that can be accessed under the Company's profile at www.sedarplus.ca and on the Company's website at: www.MaxPowerMining.com.

Any participation by insiders in the Private Placement would constitute a \"related party transaction\" as defined under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\").

The use of any of the words \"anticipate\", \"plan\", \"continue\", \"expect\", \"estimate\", \"objective\", \"may\", \"will\", \"project\", \"should\", \"predict\", \"potential\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. In particular, this press release contains forward looking statements concerning, without limitation, statements relating to the Offering (including with respect to the timing and closing of the Offering). Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the Company cannot give any assurance that they will prove correct. Since forward looking statements address future events and conditions, they involve inherent assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of assumptions, factors and risks. These assumptions and risks include, but are not limited to, assumptions and risks associated with the receipt of regulatory or shareholder approvals, and risks related to the state of financial markets or future metals prices.\n\nManagement has provided the above summary of risks and assumptions related to forward looking statements in this press release in order to provide readers with a more comprehensive perspective on the Company's future operations. The Company's actual results, performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what benefits the Company will derive from them. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release, and, other than as required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise.\n\nNeither the Canadian Securities Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider

(TSXV:BAY);(OTCQB:ATBHF) (\"Aston Bay\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has today closed a first tranche of the Company's non-brokered private placement, previously announced on April 24, 2024 (the \"Offering\"). Pursuant to this first tranche of the Offering, the Company has issued 9,200,000 flow-through shares (each a \"FT Share\") at a price of $0.15 per FT Share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,380,000. The closing is subject to final acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange.\n\nAll shares acquired by the placees under the first tranche of the Offering, are subject to a hold period until September 10, 2024, in accordance with applicable Canadian securities legislation. In connection with the closing of the first tranche of the Offering, Aston Bay has paid aggregate cash finder's fees of $82,880 to three arm's length finders, representing 6% of the proceeds raised from subscriptions by placees introduced by the finders.\n\nNon-flow through units (the \"Units\") at a price of $0.12 per Unit (the \"LIFE Offering\") and FT Shares at a price of $0.15 per FT Share continue to be available as part of the Offering, in which the Company may raise up to an additional $3,620,000. Each Unit will consist of one Common Share and one common share purchase warrant (a \"Warrant\"), with each Warrant entitling the holder thereof to acquire an additional Common Share (the \"Warrant Share\") at an exercise price of $0.18 per Warrant Share for a period of 24 months from the date of issuance.\n\nThe Units to be issued under the LIFE Offering will be offered to purchasers pursuant to the Listed Issuer Financing Exemption (the \"LIFE Exemption\") under Part 5A of National Instrument 45-106 - Prospectus Exemptions, in all the provinces and territories of Canada, except Quebec. The FT Shares will be sold pursuant to the exemptions from the prospectus requirements in Canada other than the LIFE Exemption in each of the jurisdictions of Canada and in offshore jurisdictions. The FS Shares will be subject to statutory hold periods in accordance with applicable Canadian Securities Laws.\n\nThere is an offering document (the \"Offering Document\") related to the LIFE Offering that can be accessed under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on the Company's website at https://astonbayholdings.com/news/all. Prospective investors of the Units should read the Offering Document before making an investment decision.\n\nThe Company plans to use the net proceeds of the Offering for exploration and development purposes of its projects in Nunavut, Canada and Virginia, USA and for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Offering is scheduled to close on or about May 30, 2024 or on such other date as the Company may determine, and is subject to receipt of all necessary approvals, including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.\n\nThe Company anticipates that current insiders of the Company may participate in the Offering. Subject to Exchange approval, finder's fees may be paid to persons who introduce the Company to investors. The Offering may be closed in tranches as subscriptions are received.\n\nThe securities offered have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold absent registration or compliance with an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) has reviewed or accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n\nAbout Aston Bay Holdings\n\nAston Bay is a publicly traded mineral exploration company exploring for high-grade copper and gold deposits in Virginia, USA, and Nunavut, Canada. The Company is led by CEO Thomas Ullrich with exploration in Virginia directed by the Company's advisor, Don Taylor, the 2018 Thayer Lindsley Award winner for his discovery of the Taylor Pb-Zn-Ag Deposit in Arizona. The Company is currently exploring the Storm Project property and Epworth property in Nunavut, as well as the high-grade Buckingham Gold Vein and critical metals prospects in central Virginia and is in advanced stages of negotiation on other lands with high-grade copper potential in the area.\n\nThe Company and its joint venture partners, American West Metals Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tornado Metals Ltd. (collectively, \"American West\") have agreed to form a 20/80 unincorporated joint venture and enter into a joint venture agreement in respect of the Storm Project property, which hosts the Storm Copper Project and the Seal Zinc Deposit. Under such agreement, Aston Bay shall have a free carried interest until American West has made a decision to mine upon completion of a bankable feasibility study, meaning American West will be solely responsible for funding the joint venture until such decision is made. After such decision is made, Aston Bay will be diluted in the event it does not elect to contribute its proportionate share and its interest in the Storm Project property will be converted into a 2% net smelter returns royalty if its interest is diluted to below 10%.\n\nFurther details are available on the Company's website at https://astonbayholdings.com/.\n\nThe Company's public disclosure documents are available on www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nStatements made in this press release, including those regarding the closing and the use of proceeds of the private placement, management objectives, forecasts, estimates, expectations, or predictions of the future may constitute \"forward-looking statement\", which can be identified by the use of conditional or future tenses or by the use of such verbs as \"believe\", \"expect\", \"may\", \"will\", \"should\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"project\", \"plan\", and words of similar import, including variations thereof and negative forms. This press release contains forward-looking statements that reflect, as of the date of this press release, Aston Bay's expectations, estimates and projections about its operations, the mining industry and the economic environment in which it operates. Statements in this press release that are not supported by historical fact are forward-looking statements, meaning they involve risk, uncertainty and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although Aston Bay believes that the assumptions inherent in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on these statements, which apply only at the time of writing of this press release. Aston Bay disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by securities legislation. We seek safe harbour.\n\nTHIS PRESS RELEASE, REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE CANADIAN LAWS, IS NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWS SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER TO SELL OR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO SELL ANY OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN IN THE UNITED STATES.

An aggregate of 10,874,360 Units were sold under the First Tranche at a price of C$0.20 per Unit (the \"Issue Price\"), for total gross proceeds of C$2,174,872.00.\n\nEach Unit is composed of one common share in the capital of the Company (a \"Common Share\") and one Common Share purchase warrant (a \"Warrant\").

(CSE: TMIN) (the \"Company\" or \"Teako\") announced today that it is closing the second and final tranche of a non-brokered private placement of common shares of the Company (\"Common Shares\") at a price of $0.09 (see press releases dated March 14, 2024, March 18, 2024, and April 11, 2024) for total gross proceeds of $964,070 (the \"Offering\").\n\nIn connection with the Offering, the Company issued 6,439,996 Common Shares under the first tranche for aggregate proceeds of $579,599 and 4,271,900 Common Shares under the second tranche for aggregate proceeds of $384,471. Under the Offering, Teako issued, in aggregate, 10,711,896 Common Shares which brings the total issued and outstanding share count to 71.599.808. The Company did not pay any finder's fees in cash or securities under the Offering.\n\nThe Company's largest shareholder, Fruchtexpress Grabher GmbH & Co KG (\"FEx\"), participated in the Offering and acquired an aggregate of 1,330,000 Common Shares. FEx's participation in the Offering constitutes a \"related party transaction\", as such term is defined in Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Securityholders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"). In completing the Offering, the Company has relied on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements enumerated in sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, respectively, as neither the fair market value of the Common Shares purchased nor the consideration paid by FEx exceeds 25% of the Company's market capitalization.\n\nThe second tranche of the Offering, in conjunction with FEx, was fully subscribed by the same group of investors from Denmark who had participated in the initial tranche. In connection with the Offering, the Company wishes to extend its gratitude to the participants for their invaluable support.\n\nChief Executive Officer, Sven Gollan, comments: \"Investors with strong hands have participated in this financing. Each of them has a deep understanding of how to build a real business and fully supports our plans in Norway. Now it's up to us to shift Teako into a higher gear and prove ourselves worthy of this vote of confidence\".\n\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering for mineral exploration programs in Norway and Finland (see news release dated January 18, 2024), as well as general working capital purposes. All of the Common Shares issued under the Offering will be subject to a four-month and one-day statutory hold period.\n\nThe Common Shares have not and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\"), or any applicable state securities laws and may not be offered or sold to, or for the account or benefit of, persons in the United States or \"U.S. persons,\" as such term is defined in Regulation S promulgated under the U.S. Securities Act, absent registration or an exemption from such registration requirements. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of the Common Shares in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\n\nAbout Teako Minerals Corp.\n\nTeako Minerals Corp. is a Vancouver-based mineral exploration company committed to acquiring, exploring, and developing mineral properties in Norway and Finland exploring for copper, cobalt, gold, molybdenum, and rare earth elements (REE). The adoption of technologies such as the SCS Exploration Product aligns with its strategy to remain at the forefront of the rapidly evolving mining industry.\n\nON BEHALF OF TEAKO MINERALS CORP.\n\n\"Sven Gollan\"\n\nCEO\n\nT: +43 5522 500429\n\nEmail: This email address is being protected from spambots.

Forward-looking information is based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by the management of Teako. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as \"will,\" \"may,\" \"would,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"seek,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"likely,\" \"could\" and variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this press release include statements related to the approvals of the Offering, the use of proceeds for the Offering, and the Company's business plans and operations. Although Teako believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking information because Teako can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature, they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, risks associated with the mineral exploration industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and production; the uncertainty of mineral resource estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses, and health, safety and environmental risks), constraint in the availability of services, commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations, changes in legislation impacting the mining industry, adverse weather conditions and uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures. These and other risks are set out in more detail in Teako's interim Management's Discussion and Analysis for the nine months ended October 31, 2023.\n\nNeither the Canadian Securities Exchange nor its Market Regulator (as such term is defined in the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.", "source": {"uri":

(TSXV: ARU) (OTCQB: AUIAF) (FSE: 20Q) (\"Aurania\" or the \"Company\") announces that, further to its news releases of April 17, 2024 and April 24, 2024, it has closed the first tranche (the \"First Tranche\") of its non-brokered private placement of up to 20,000,000 units (\"Units\") for aggregate gross proceeds of up to C$4,000,000, subject to the right of the Company to increase the size of the Initial Offering by up to 25% (the \"Offering\"). An aggregate of 10,874,360 Units were sold under the First Tranche at a price of C$0.20 per Unit (the \"Issue Price\"), for total gross proceeds of C$2,174,872.00.\n\nEach Unit is composed of one common share in the capital of the Company (a \"Common Share\") and one Common Share purchase warrant (a \"Warrant\"). Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Common Share (a \"Warrant Share\") at an exercise price of C$0.45 per Warrant Share at any time until May 9, 2026. The Company expects to close the second and final tranche of the Offering on or around May 17, 2024.\n\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds raised from the Offering for exploration and target refinement at the Kuri-Yawi target area in Ecuador, and for general working capital purposes, as described in greater detail in its news release of April 17, 2024.\n\nIn connection with the closing of the First Tranche, the Company paid commissions to certain finders of an aggregate of $3,430.00 in cash and 17,150 finders warrants (each a \"Finder Warrant\"). Each Finder Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one (1) Unit at the Issue Price and is exercisable for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the closing of the First Tranche.\n\nThe Company also announces that it has completed the debt settlement transaction, as first announced on April 17, 2024, and April 24, 2024 (the \"Debt Settlement\"). Pursuant to the Debt Settlement, the Company issued an aggregate of 10,360,825 Common Shares to Dr. Keith Barron, the CEO and a director of the Company, in settlement of C$2.0 million of loans plus interest thereon of C$72,165, for an aggregate amount of C$2,072,165 owed to him (the \"Debt\") by the Company, at a price of C$0.20 per Common Share. The Debt related to promissory notes of the Company in respect of loans by Dr. Barron for the purpose of providing cash resources to the Company. The Company had elected to settle the indebtedness through the issuance of Common Shares to preserve cash and strengthen the Company's balance sheet.\n\nCompletion of the Debt Settlement and the First Tranche is subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, including the final approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. All securities issued and issuable pursuant to the First Tranche of the Offering and the Debt Settlement are subject to a four-month plus one day hold period commencing on the date of issuance.\n\nRelated Party Transaction and Early Warning Report\n\nDr. Barron acquired 10,360,825 Common Shares pursuant to the Debt Settlement and 2,303,360 Units pursuant to the Offering (together, the \"Acquisition\"). Such transactions constitute a \"related party transaction\" as defined under the policies of the TSXV and Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"). The Company is relying on exemptions from the minority shareholder approval and formal valuation requirements applicable to the related party transactions under sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a), respectively, of MI 61-101, as the fair market value of the participation in the Debt Settlement and the Offering does not exceed 25 percent of the Company's market capitalization.\n\nPrior to the Acquisition, Dr. Barron owned 29,251,525 Common Shares, 1,203,992 options to purchase Shares (\"Options\"), and 9,317,997 Warrants, representing 43.4% and 51.0% of the Issuer's issued and outstanding common shares on an undiluted and partially diluted basis, respectively. Following the Acquisition, Dr. Barron now owns or controls an aggregate of 41,915,710 Shares, 1,203,992 Options, and 11,621,357 Warrants, representing 47.3% and 53.9% of the Issuer's issued and outstanding common shares on an undiluted and partially diluted basis, respectively.\n\nIn satisfaction of the requirements of National Instrument 62-104 - Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids and National Instrument 62-103 - The Early Warning System and Related Take-Over Bid and Insider Reporting Issues, an early warning report respecting the acquisition of securities by Dr. Barron will be filed under the Company's SEDAR+ Profile at www.sedarplus.ca.\n\nThe Purchases were completed for investment purposes. Depending on market and other conditions, Dr. Barron may from time to time in the future increase or decrease their ownership, control or direction over securities of the Company, through market transactions, private agreements, or otherwise.\n\nThe securities described herein have not been, and will not be, registered under the United States Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and accordingly may not be offered or sold within the United States except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities requirements or pursuant to exemptions therefrom. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy any securities in any jurisdiction.\n\nAbout Aurania\n\nAurania is a mineral exploration company engaged in the identification, evaluation, acquisition and exploration of mineral property interests, with a focus on precious metals and copper in South America.

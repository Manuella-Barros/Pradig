{"id": 237071990, "title": "Putin\u2019s \u2018destabilising\u2019 North Korea trip unnerves Seoul with \u2018existential threats\u2019", "text": "South Korea has issued a stern warning to Russia against helping the North\u2019s military ambitions as President Vladimir Putin\u2019s coming visit to Pyongyang signals a major shift in regional power dynamics that analysts say could be \u201cvery destabilising\u201d. Putin will be in North Korea for a \u201cfriendly state visit\u201d from Tuesday to Wednesday, the Kremlin and North Korean media reported on Monday. He will then travel to Vietnam from Wednesday to Thursday to advance the \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership\u201d between Moscow and Hanoi, the Kremlin and Vietnamese state media said. South Korea\u2019s Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said Seoul had conveyed a \u201cwarning message\u201d to Moscow that \u201cnegotiations with the North should not be conducted in a way that undermines peace and stability on the Korean peninsula\u201d. Seoul will \u201ctake necessary countermeasures depending on the outcome\u201d of Putin\u2019s visit, Cho said on Sunday, amid speculation that Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un could discuss military cooperation. The countries\u2019 closer ties were being driven by need in the wake of the war in Ukraine and mounting geopolitical risks, Cho said. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether this cooperation will lead to a long-term, strategic relationship, or whether it will be a temporary, tactical cooperation out of short-term necessity,\u201d he told South Korean television network Channel-A. Chang Ho-jin, national security adviser to President Yoon Suk-yeol, said on Sunday that Seoul had warned Moscow against crossing an unspecified red line in negotiations with the North. \u201cI think when the war in Ukraine is over, it would be necessary for [Russia] to think carefully about which one is more important and helpful for its national interest \u2013 the South or the North\u201d, Chang said. But Chang stressed that Putin\u2019s visit did not necessarily indicate the emergence of a trilateral alliance involving Russia, China and North Korea to counter the deepening three-way military ties among South Korea, the United States and Japan. China and South Korea are set to hold their first round of diplomatic and security dialogue in Seoul on Tuesday following an agreement struck between Yoon and Chinese Premier Li Qiang last month. South Korea was also verifying allegations that Russia was helping the North to develop missiles and spy satellites, which would pose \u201cexistential threats\u201d to the South, said Park Won-gon, a political-science professor at Ewha Woman\u2019s University in Seoul. Sydney Seiler, the Korea chair at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that Putin\u2019s visit appeared to reinforce the desires of Moscow and Pyongyang to show they have \u201cpartners in this new direction\u201d that the Russian president wants the international community to take. Kim wants to show the West that North Korea can prevail despite international isolation, sanctions and pressure and that he has partners to turn to, according to Seiler. \u201cI believe China is somewhat concerned over it\u201d, he said, adding that Russia\u2019s aid to North Korea was \u201cpotentially very destabilising in a way that is detrimental to China\u2019s interest\u201d. \u201cMy personal hope is that China seeks to shape the nature of that cooperation to ensure Russia does not embolden and enable North Korea to engage in more adventurous and dangerous activities,\u201d Seiler told This Week in Asia. In the near term, Pyongyang and Moscow working closer together was \u201cprimarily symbolic\u201d, he added. Jenny Town, a senior fellow at the Stimson Centre think tank, said Kim could \u201cget a lot\u201d out of the relationship with Russia following a \u201cvery difficult period\u201d that had included the North\u2019s pandemic-triggered isolation and failure in its negotiations with the US. \u201cBeing able to meet Putin is one big political victory\u201d for Kim, she said, as Russia\u2019s veto power provides cover at the UN Security Council and helps present an image that the North is \u201ca much bigger player in global politics than it should be\u201d. Town said immediate, tangible results in trade, military and agricultural cooperation could also result, bolstering Kim\u2019s claim to \u201cstrong leadership\u201d as North Korea emerges from its latest bout of economic hardship. In the longer term, she said the visit would enable North Korea to transition its economy \u201cat a much faster rate\u201d towards a greater focus on defence exports, rather than light industries like food production. But Town said she was not expecting any major pronouncements to be made during the visit, as economic and military cooperation between the two countries is subject to international sanctions. \u201cIt\u2019s also questionable whether either one of them wants to deepen military cooperation or formalise it,\u201d she said. \u201cRussia sees value in North Korea as a military partner in the war against the West, which incentivises it to do more \u2026 beyond just arms deals to supplement its war-fighting efforts in Ukraine.\u201d North Korea failed in its latest attempt to launch a military reconnaissance satellite last month. Russia is suspected of providing technological support for North Korea\u2019s satellite and other programmes since Kim visited Russia to meet Putin and tour key technology and military sites in September last year. After the launch failure, Kim said it amounted to an \u201cantirevolutionary\u201d attitude to try to rely on foreign technology. His remarks suggested that the North was \u201creluctant to formalise\u201d cooperation in military technology with Russia, Town said. She noted that Russia and China had responded differently to a proposal in March for a mandate extension of the UN Security Council\u2019s expert panel monitoring the enforcement of sanctions against North Korea. Moscow vetoed the proposal, while Beijing abstained from voting. She said North Korea viewed Russia as its \u201cNo 1 foreign-policy priority\u201d at a time when Russia was trying to upend the US-led world order while China was trying to be part of the global system and have some say in it. China will never openly cooperate militarily with North Korea Jenny Town, Stimson Centre senior fellow \u201cChina will never openly cooperate militarily with North Korea,\u201d Town said. China would cooperate with North Korea mainly in the political and economic arena, she said, \u201cwhich makes Russia\u2019s willingness to have that deeper relationship including military cooperation very attractive for North Korea\u201d. While China was maintaining its position in support of denuclearisation of North Korea, \u201cRussia accepts North Korea as a nuclear-armed country\u201d, Town added. \u201cAs long as Russia sees value in North Korea as a military partner, North Korea is going to keep Russia as its priority at the moment.\u201d", "summary": "Russia\u2019s president is heading to Pyongyang for a \u2018friendly\u2019 two-day visit from Tuesday, state media said, followed by Vietnam.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3266973/putins-destabilising-north-korea-trip-unnerves-seoul-existential-threats", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/17/7a13629f-2473-4265-b16f-f5f39cb44ece_31593c34.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:00:13", "author": "Park Chan-kyong", "authors": ["Park Chan-kyong"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": 0.521}

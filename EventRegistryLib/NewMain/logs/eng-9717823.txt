The United Nations states that rising population impacts economic development, employment, income distribution, poverty, and social protection. It also affects access to healthcare, education, housing, sanitation, water, food, and energy. Policymakers need accurate population data to address these needs sustainably. Established by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1989, following the Day of Five Billion in 1987, World Population Day highlights the urgency of population issues. In December 1990, the United Nations General Assembly decided to continue observing this day to raise awareness about population impacts on the environment and development. Since July 11, 1990, World Population Day has been celebrated globally.\n\nWorld Population Day plays a vital role in bringing attention to population dynamics and their effects on socioeconomic development, environmental sustainability, and individual well-being. It serves as a platform for governments, organizations, and individuals to engage in discussions and take action. The event encourages the implementation of policies and programs that support sustainable development and the well-being of all individuals.\n\nThe Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) established World Population Day in 1989. The inspiration for this observance came from the public interest in 'Five Billion Day,' the date on which the world's population reached an estimated five billion. Recognizing the need for awareness about population issues, the United Nations General Assembly decided in December 1990 to continue observing World Population Day every year on July 11. Today, the world's population has reached nearly 7.9 billion, highlighting the rapid increase and the necessity for continued awareness and action.\n\nWorld Population Day 2024 | Photo: Freepik\n\nThe theme for World Population Day 2024 has yet to be announced by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in coordination with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Each year's theme focuses on different aspects of population issues, aiming to address the most pressing concerns.\n\nWorld Population Day is celebrated to focus on the importance of population issues and to educate people about the impact of overpopulation. Overpopulation can cause severe problems such as environmental degradation, public health challenges, and strain on resources. Raising awareness about these issues is crucial for fostering discussions and finding solutions.\n\nThe significance of World Population Day lies in its ability to highlight the impact of population dynamics on various aspects of life. It brings attention to the challenges and opportunities presented by a growing population and encourages proactive measures to address these issues. The day emphasizes the importance of reproductive rights, family planning, and sustainable development to ensure a better future for all.\n\nHere are some inspirational quotes to use for World Population Day 2024:\n\nOverpopulation is a critical concern in India. Since gaining independence in 1947, India's population has grown from 336 million to 1.5 billion. This rapid growth has led to issues such as public health challenges, poverty, and limited access to healthcare. World Population Day serves as a reminder of the need to address these concerns through effective policies and programs.\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nToday, we gather to observe World Population Day, celebrated each year on July 11. This day aims to raise awareness about global population issues and how they affect our society. Established by the United Nations, this important event highlights the need to address concerns such as reproductive health, family planning, gender equality, and sustainable development.\n\nWorld Population Day provides a platform for governments, organizations, and individuals to discuss and take action on population-related challenges and opportunities. Through this observance, the United Nations encourages understanding, collaboration, and innovative solutions to ensure a sustainable future for all countries.\n\nOver the years, World Population Day has been crucial in raising awareness, advocating for reproductive rights, and promoting policies and programs that support sustainable development and the well-being of all individuals. The significance of this day lies in its ability to spark discussions about how population dynamics impact socioeconomic development, environmental sustainability, and individual well-being. It reminds us that our growing population presents both challenges and opportunities that require our proactive measures.\n\nHave you ever heard the term 'population explosion'? It refers to the sudden increase in the total number of people in the world, which puts greater pressure on our resources. Many developing nations, like India, face this threat due to rapid population growth. Overpopulation has become a serious concern, affecting a nation's overall condition in multiple ways. On World Population Day, it is essential to raise awareness about this issue.\n\nWhat causes population explosion? One major reason is the increase in birth rate. The birth rate is the number of individuals born in a particular population over a given period. A high birth rate significantly contributes to the growth of a nation's total population.\n\nAnother key factor is the decrease in the death rate. The death rate is the number of individual deaths in a particular population over a given period. Advances in medical technologies have greatly reduced the death rate. Fewer people are dying due to lack of medical support, which contributes to population growth.\n\nPoverty and low living standards also play a role in the increasing population. The number of poor people in the world is much higher than the number of rich ones. If we do not take timely measures, the world population will continue to grow to a point where Mother Nature can no longer support life on earth.\n\nAs per the official website of the UN, The world population took hundreds of thousands of years to reach 1 billion, but in just about 200 years, it increased sevenfold. In 2011, the global population hit 7 billion. By 2021, it was nearly 7.9 billion and is expected to grow to around 8.5 billion by 2030, 9.7 billion by 2050, and 10.9 billion by 2100.\n\nThis rapid growth is mainly due to more people surviving to reproductive age, changes in fertility rates, increased urbanization, and faster migration. These trends will significantly impact future generations.\n\nIn recent decades, there have been significant changes in fertility rates and life expectancy. In the early 1970s, women had an average of 4.5 children each, but by 2015, the global average had dropped to below 2.5 children per woman. Meanwhile, global life expectancy rose from 64.6 years in the early 1990s to 72.6 years in 2019.\n\nUrbanization and migration have also increased. In 2007, for the first time, more people lived in urban areas than in rural ones. By 2050, about 66 percent of the world population will live in cities.\n\nThese major trends affect many areas, including economic development, employment, income distribution, poverty, and social protections. They also influence efforts to provide universal access to healthcare, education, housing, sanitation, water, food, and energy. Policymakers need to understand the current and future population dynamics to address these needs sustainably.", "source": {"uri": "indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndiaTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Development Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human overpopulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Population dynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overpopulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overpopulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Population_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Population Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://im.indiatimes.in/content/template/share/637717.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 193, "textEnd": 200, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "date": "1990-07-11", "textStart": 948, "textEnd": 961}, {"amb": false, "date": "1990-12-", "textStart": 772, "textEnd": 785, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

As per details by the UN, in 2011, the global population reached the 7 billion mark, it was almost 7.9 billion in 2021, and it's expected to grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, and 10.9 billion in 2100. The growth has been driven largely by major changes in fertility rates, increasing urbanisation and accelerating migration.

The global event was established by the then-Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme in 1989, an outgrowth of the interest generated by the Day of Five Billion, which was observed on 11 July 1987. By resolution 45/216 of December 1990, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) decided to continue observing World Population Day to enhance awareness of population issues, including their relations to the environment and development.\n\nThe day was suggested by Dr KC Zachariah in which population reached five billion when he worked as Sr Demographer at the World Bank. World Population Day was observed for the first time on July 11, 1990 in more than 90 countries. Since then, a number of a number of UNFPA country offices, organisations and institutions have commemorated World Population Day across the world.\n\nWorld Population Day aims to highlight the urgency and importance of population issues, including their relations to the environment and development. The day increases awareness of various population issues such as the importance of family planning, gender equality, poverty, maternal health and human rights.

This day focuses on educating people about family planning, gender equality, and reproductive health. Established by the United Nations in 1989, it commemorates the \"Day of Five Billion\" when the world's population surpassed five billion.\n\nMessage from UNFPA Executive Director\n\nOn July 1, 2024, Dr Natalia Kanem, Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), stated, \"World Population Day 2024 is a moment to ask who is still going uncounted and why - and what this costs individual, societies and our global efforts to leave no one behind. It is also a moment for all of us to commit to doing more to ensure that our data systems capture the full range of human diversity so that everyone is seen, can exercise their human rights and can reach their full potential.\"\n\nTheme for World Population Day 2024\n\nThe theme for World Population Day changes yearly, set by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in coordination with the UNFPA. The theme for 2024 is \"To Leave No One Behind, Count Everyone.\" According to the United Nations, \"Over the past 30 years, we've improved how we collect and use population data, leading to better health care and rights. However, marginalized communities are still underrepresented. This World Population Day, we focus on ensuring all groups are counted and visible, highlighting the importance of inclusive data systems to advance progress for everyone. Everyone counts, and our collective progress depends on capturing the full diversity of humanity.\"\n\nHistorical Background\n\nWorld Population Day has its roots in the 1980s. On July 11, 1987, the global population reached approximately five billion, drawing attention to sustainable development, resource management, and population dynamics. In 1989, the UNDP Governing Council established the annual observance of this day. The United Nations General Assembly formally adopted Resolution 45/216 in December 1990, leading to the first World Population Day celebration on July 11, 1990, with participation from over 90 countries.\n\nSignificance\n\nWorld Population Day aims to raise awareness about global population issues and promote reproductive health services and rights for all individuals. It highlights the importance of family planning, education, gender equality, and the empowerment of women. The day also underscores sustainable development and global cooperation.\n\nGovernments, NGOs, and international organizations conduct campaigns to educate people about family planning, reproductive health, and population issues.\n\nSeminars and Public Lectures\n\nEvents at local, national, and international levels provide a deep understanding of population-related issues.\n\nArt and Cultural Events\n\nArt exhibitions and performances creatively raise awareness about population issues.\n\nHealth Camps and Services\n\nHealth camps and outreach programs, especially in underserved communities, offer reproductive health services, family planning counseling, and maternal healthcare.\n\nYouth Engagement\n\nActivities targeting young people educate them about their rights, responsibilities, and choices regarding their bodies.\n\nInspirational Quotes for World Population Day\n\n* \"The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.\" - Thomas Malthus\n\n* \"Family planning could bring more benefits to more people at less cost than any other single technology now available to the human race.\" - John Bongaarts\n\n* \"There are no passengers on spaceship Earth. We are all crew.\" - Marshall McLuhan\n\n* \"Reproductive freedom is critical to a whole range of issues. If we can't take charge of this most personal aspect of our lives, we can't take care of anything. It should not be seen as a privilege or as a benefit, but a fundamental human right.\" - Faye Wattleton\n\n* \"Overpopulation leads to increased poverty and to increased ignorance. In order to fight overpopulation, we must educate all the children of the world, which is why we are promoting birth control. With birth control, you can have a healthier family and a healthier planet.\" - Anne Lamott\n\n* \"By improving health, empowering women, population growth comes down.\" - Bill Gates\n\n* \"The whole of the global economy is based on supplying the cravings of two per cent of the world's population.\" - Bill Bryson\n\n* \"You cannot control your own population by force, but it can be distracted by

Control Measures Explained", "body": "The day to remember is World Population Day in 2024, which sheds light on the adversities of growing population. Know these significant disadvantages of increasing population and effective means to check them.\n\nWorld Population Day 2024: World Population Day falls on July 11 and is marked in history as a transformative event to enhance public awareness of the condition of the world population. Convened by the United Nations in 1989, this event was to underscore the Emergency and Seriousness of Population Issues. This calls upon the theme of World Population Day 2024: 'Who is still not counted?' -- the kind of counting where missing people count in population statistics, and the consequences of the existing conditions behind these gaps for people, societies, and global actions toward resilient and sustainable development.\n\nHigh Population Growth- A Major Challenge\n\nThe population of the world has been increasing in a very alarming way. According to the United Nations, this increase affects all major factors of human life which varies from employment to economic development and from poverty to the distribution of income and social stability. In particular, rapid growth in population of developing countries poses a great strain of challenge for both sustainable development and environmental sustainability.\n\nThere are disadvantages to the rapidly increasing population in different parts of the country and the world. If we talk in the context of India, then the population here too has arisen rapidly, and presently, the population of the country has reached an estimated 140 crores. The continuously rising population leads to increasing unemployment -- the biggest challenge.\n\nRapid Growth in Population - Disadvantages\n\nResource Depletion: The population rates are increasing and the demands for resources, such as water, minerals, and fossil fuel, are getting high each day. This would definitely lead to resource exhaustion and environmental degradation.\n\nEnvironmental Degradation: This all leads to overutilization, which, in turn, leads to deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and emissions into the air, consequently altering the climate.\n\nEconomic Strain: The rapidly rising population puts heavy pressure on economic resources, therefore proper employment, health, and education are hard to secure. It leads to an increase in poverty and the problem of income inequalities.\n\nInfrastructure Pressure: The rate of population growth is so fast that it brings an inadequacy of housing, transport, and sanitary facilities in cities, leading to overcrowding. It degrades the quality of life and multiplies the risk factor for health crises.\n\nFood Security: Many more people would demand more in terms of reassuring food security. High population can lead to malnutrition and even famine, especially in regions where food production is not enough to cater to the ever-increasing population.\n\nHow to Control Population Growth\n\nEducation and Awareness: Education should be provided to everyone, especially women and girls. Educated people have a better way of understanding and practicing the family planning measures.\n\nFamily Planning Programs: Provision of contraception and family planning services helps in determining the number of children families can support. This should be made widely available by governments and NGOs.\n\nEconomic Incentives: Governments can certainly put in place policies that provide an economic benefit for families that would have a constrained number of children, through tax incentives, subsidized health care, and benefits in education.\n\nLegislation and Policies: Legislation striving for smaller family norms and policies supporting reproductive health can help the most in population control efforts.\n\nHealth Access: More health access for women will ensure women make decisions regarding their reproduction. This includes prenatal and postnatal care, which can reduce infant and maternal mortality rates and therefore encourage smaller families.\n\nWorld Population Day 2024 will be a critical reflection of the dire need to address population growth and the ramifications that follow. Hitherto, societies will come closer to attaining sustainable development and a healthier planet as they appreciate the challenges and ultimately implement effective control measures. There is an urgent need for sensitization about people in terms of the necessary population control and to enhance international cooperation in managing the population across the world.", "source": {"uri": "dnpindia.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNP INDIA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sparsh_goel@dnpindia.in", "name": "Sparsh Goel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Income distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recreational drug use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mineral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deforestation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biodiversity loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Population control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maternal death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.dnpindia.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/World-Population-Day-2024.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 268, "textEnd": 275}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The population of this planet when it comes to human beings is increasing at a rapid pace and it is bringing with it a lot of problems. In this article, we will take a look at the importance of celebrating this day.\n\nThe exponential growth of the population of human beings is mostly due to more people surviving to reproductive age. With the evolution of technology, there have been major changes in fertility rates, increasing urbanization and accelerating migration, and these will have a profound effect on the coming generations. Over the years, the United Nations has been tirelessly working to solve these complex and interrelated issues and is deploying the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and the UN Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs for this.\n\nWhile the world population took hundreds of thousands of years to reach the 1 billion mark, it took just around 200 more years to increase the number almost seven times. In 2011, the global population reached 7 billion and in 2021, it was at almost 7.9 billion. By 2030, it is expected to reach 8.5 billion, 9.7 billion in 2050, and 10.9 billion in 2100. There have been massive changes in life expectancy and fertility rates. Also, there has been rapid urbanization and increasing migration and it started in the true sense in 2007 when more people lived in urban areas than in rural areas.\n\nThis rise in population impacts the economic development of people and the employment opportunities are not in proportion with the rising population. It is affecting income distribution leading to poverty and is also affecting efforts to ensure universal access to education, health care, housing, food, water, sanitation, and energy. It is time for the policymakers to understand the impact of population increase, their age and living conditions and how the numbers are going to increase in future. The objective of World Population Day, over the years, has been to increase the awareness of people on various population issues such as gender equality, the importance of family planning, human rights, poverty and maternal health. In this increasingly unpredictable world, we also need reliable data on the population to reach and respond to the needs of those who have been left behind, those people who are not counted often in the population.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swapnajit_kundu@news9live.com", "name": "Swapnajit Kundu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Total fertility rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Population_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Population Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urbanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maternal health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Income distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rural area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Population.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 25, "textEnd": 32}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

It is a way to raise awareness of serious problems related to population growth. It is in an effort to raise awareness of the urgent need to address population-related concerns.\n\nHistory of World Population Day:\n\nWorld Population Day was established by the United Nations in 1989. This special day was created in response to the significance of the world population surpassing five billion people in July 1987. Dr. K.C. Zachariah suggested a celebration of this day.\n\nWorld's Population:\n\nThe world's population has increased by over three times since the middle of the 20th century. According to the UN, there were eight billion people on the planet as of mid-November 2022, up from 2.5 billion in 1950. This number has increased by one billion since 2010 and two billion since 1998. Within the next 30 years, there will be two billion people on the planet. The population is predicted to peak at 10.4 billion in the middle of the 2080s, having reached 9.7 billion in 2050. China and India are the two most populous countries in the world, with respective populations of over one billion and around 18 per cent of the global population.\n\nPositive & Negative Effects of Population Growth on Economic Development:\n\nThe United Nations Population Fund's (UNFPA) State of World Population - 2024 report, titled 'Interwoven Lives, Threads of Hope: Ending Inequalities in Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights,' unveiled that India's population is projected to double in 77 years. India holds the top spot globally with an estimated population of 144.17 crore, closely followed by China at 142.5 crore, as per the report.\n\nIndia's population was recorded at 1.21 billion during the last census conducted in 2011. The report also provided further details, indicating that approximately 24 per cent of India's population falls within the 0-14 age group, while 17 per cent is between the ages of 10 and 19. The segment aged 10-24 is estimated to constitute 26 per cent of the population, with the 15-64 age group representing 68 per cent. Additionally, 7 per cent of India's population is 65 years and older, with men expected to live to 71 years and women to 74 years.\n\nOverpopulation in India:\n\nIndia is the most populated country in the world, home to over 1.3 billion people. It overtakes China to claim the title of the world's most populous nation. But with the country's population growing at an unsustainable rate, India faces a serious overpopulation problem. Population projections suggest that India's population may exceed 1.5 billion by 2030 and two billion by 2050, resulting in a substantial demand on the country's resources and a worsening of social instability, poverty, and environmental degradation. Although the government has taken some steps to address this problem, it is obvious that far more extensive action is needed.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demographics of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Population_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Population Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human overpopulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/10-07-2024/1200-675-21916927-744-21916927-1720613223907.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 58, "textEnd": 65}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

This was a result of 11.1 million deaths and 9 million births in China, marking the second year in which China's total population has been reduced.\n\nThe UNFPA report indicates that if India's population continues to grow at the current rate of just under one per cent annually, it will double from its current value in the next 75 years. Experts say that India's large population is a result of the \"population momentum\" from earlier decades and that the country's population is likely to start its decline closer to 2050.\n\nThis trend would also apply to the global population, which is currently slightly above 8 billion. However, it is expected that both India's and the world's populations will stabilise long before that.\n\nRecognising the growth trends in population, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) emphasised the urgency of global population issues by establishing the Day of the Five Billion in 1987, which they have been observing as World Population Day on July 11th annually since 1990.\n\nThis year, in 2024, it will fall on a Thursday and will emphasise the theme Investing in data collection is important to understanding problems, tailoring solutions, and driving progress.\"\n\nOn World Population Day, we aim to raise awareness and understanding of global population issues, including demographic trends, growth projections, and their impact on sustainable development.

The United Nations Development Program's Governing Council founded the event in 1989.\n\nThe goal of World Population Day is to raise public understanding about a range of population-related issues, including the value of family planning, gender equality, poverty, maternal health, and human rights.\n\nThe day promotes discussions about a range of topics, including gender equality, family planning, reproductive health, and sustainable development. It underlines the significance of ethical population control as well as universal access to healthcare and education. The need to address poverty, food security, and environmental sustainability is also emphasised on World Population Day.\n\nThis day is to act as a reminder of the shared duty to create a balanced and prosperous future for mankind via education, lobbying, and policy measures.\n\nWorld Population Day 2024: Theme\n\nThe theme of World Population Day this year is \"Leave no one behind, count everyone: Over the past 30 years, we've improved how we collect and use population data, leading to better health care and rights,\" according to the United Nations.\"\n\nWorld Population Day: History\n\nThe United Nations established this particular day in 1989. The introduction of World Population Day, as proposed by Dr KC Zachariah, former Senior Demographer at World Bank, was prompted by the world population reaching five billion on July 11, 1987.\n\nTo draw attention to the potential and problems brought on by an increasing global population, the United Nations established it in 1989.\n\nWorld Population Day: Significance\n\nEvery year on July 11, the World Population Day event plays a significant role in bringing attention to concerns related to the world population. This day highlights the issues brought on by population growth, including poverty, a lack of food and water, environmental damage, and overburdened healthcare systems. It acts as a reminder for people, groups, and organisations, as well as for governments, to solve these urgent issues.\n\nTo build a world where every individual has a developing future full of promises, potential, and opportunities, the United Nations focuses on commemorating the day. In line with Agenda 2030's Sustainable Goals, it also seeks to build a sustainable future for everyone.\n\nWorld Population Day 2024: Quotes To Share\n\n\"The Earth is a precious gift, and it is our responsibility to safeguard it for future generations.

The world's population, which continues to grow at varying rates in different regions, has already surpassed 8 billion people.\n\nAccording to the UN Population Fund's (UNFPA) \"2024 State of World Population Report,\" global population dynamics reveal significant changes in regional growth patterns, population density, and urbanization rates. As populations age globally, Europe, North America, and parts of Asia are seeing rising elderly proportions, posing challenges for healthcare, retirement plans, and labor dynamics.\n\nFollowing the acceptance of a proposal by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to the UN General Assembly in 1989, July 11 is celebrated annually as \"World Population Day\" to raise awareness of population-related issues.\n\nAnadolu Agency compiled information from UN sources on the current state of the world population, including regional growth and decline trends, in observance of World Population Day.\n\n10.3% of Global Population Aged 65 and Over\n\nAccording to UNFPA data, the global share of people aged 65 and over has nearly doubled from 5.5% in 1974 to 10.3% in 2024. This figure is projected to reach 20.7% by 2074, with the number of those aged 80 and over more than tripling. Currently, developed countries have the highest proportion of elderly populations, while developing countries are typically witnessing rapid population aging. Global population aging is linked to improvements in average life expectancy and declines in fertility rates in many countries.\n\nGlobal Fertility Rate Declining\n\nGlobal population growth is expected to continue at a slow pace through the 2080s. The global fertility rate has dropped to about 2.3 children per woman, influenced by shifts in family planning, education, and economic conditions. Developed regions such as North America and Europe have a combined population of 1.277 billion, with an average fertility rate of 1.5 children per woman. In contrast, less developed regions spanning Asia, Africa, and Latin America accommodate 6.842 billion people, with higher fertility rates averaging 2.4 children per woman.\n\nPopulation Trends in Africa and Asia\n\nAfrica remains the fastest-growing region, with significant population increases expected in countries like Nigeria, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo due to high fertility rates and improved healthcare. Population growth remains high in East and Southern Africa, with a population of 688 million, and in West and Central Africa, with a population of 516 million.\n\nIn Asia, countries like India and China are seeing slower population growth due to declining fertility rates, while Southeast Asian nations such as Indonesia and the Philippines maintain moderate growth. In Europe, low fertility rates, an aging population, and migration trends are causing population decline or stagnation. Countries like Germany, Italy, and Russia are facing challenges with shrinking workforces and rising dependency ratios.\n\nRegional Population Density\n\nGlobal population density varies significantly, with some regions becoming densely populated while others remain sparsely populated. Urban areas now host over 55% of the global population, and this proportion is expected to increase further. Cities like Tokyo, New Delhi, and Shanghai accommodate millions of residents in relatively small areas. In contrast, countries such as Canada, Australia, and Russia have large territories with sparse populations due to geographical and climatic conditions.\n\nMaternal Deaths Decreased by 34% in 20 Years\n\nUNFPA T\u00fcrkiye Representative Mariam A. Khan told Anadolu that this year's World Population Day theme is \"Threads of Hope,\" chosen in light of the six years remaining until the deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2030. Khan noted that no region in the world is on track to achieve all the goals, emphasizing the need to identify ways to accelerate progress.\n\nKhan emphasized that according to the 2024 State of World Population Report, there has been a 34% decrease in maternal deaths from 2000 to 2020, which is a significant achievement. She stated, \"Now that's really good. A similar one-third decline has happened in adolescent pregnancies. Now, these are things to celebrate. At the same time, however, the report is showing us that every day 800 women die from preventable causes of maternal deaths.\"\n\nDomestic Violence Persists Worldwide\n\nKhan emphasized the importance of investing in solutions in the right places, stating, \"162 countries have passed laws preventing domestic violence, that's incredibly impressive. Those laws exist, but are they being implemented? Are women's lives actually being saved? The data is showing us, in almost every country in the world, that there's still work to be done.\"\n\nShe emphasized that investing in women's safety is not only a human rights imperative but also crucial economically for families and individuals. The report shows that disabled women are ten times more likely to experience violence, indicating reduced access to services for those from different communities, she highlighted.\n\n\"Every nation's most important capital is its people. And if we invest in the men, the women, the young women, the young men, and the children's education, with skills for the future, we're going to be in a much better place,\" she added.", "source":

The UNDP Governing Council officially established World Population Day to be observed annually on July 11. This initiative aimed to raise awareness about population challenges and advocate for their integration into global policies and programs.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly solidified the Day's importance with the adoption of Resolution 45/216 in December 1990. This formal endorsement formally established World Population Day as a key global observance, pivotal in catalyzing action and policy discussions surrounding population dynamics.\n\nWorld Population Day serves several pivotal objectives aimed at addressing global population challenges and fostering sustainable development:\n\n1. Increase Public Awareness: Enhance understanding of global population issues, including demographic trends, growth projections, and their impact on sustainable development.\n\n2. Promote Reproductive Health Services: Advocate for access to reproductive health services, family planning information, and contraceptives to empower individuals and families in making informed decisions about their reproductive lives.\n\n3. Address Rapid Population Growth: Draw attention to challenges posed by rapid population growth, such as resource scarcity, environmental degradation, and socio-economic disparities.\n\n4. Advocate for Gender Equality: Champion gender equality and women's empowerment, emphasizing education, healthcare access, and economic opportunities as crucial for effective population management and sustainable development.\n\n5. Focus on Youth: Highlight the reproductive health education, healthcare access, and educational and employment opportunities needed by young people to support their aspirations and contribute positively to society.\n\n6. Facilitate Policy Discussions: Foster dialogue among policymakers, stakeholders, and communities on effective policies and strategies for population stabilization, equitable development, and environmental sustainability.\n\n7. Align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Align World Population Day activities with SDGs, particularly Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being), Goal 5 (Gender Equality), Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).\n\n8. Promote Data-Informed Decision Making: Encourage the use of data and research to inform decision-making and policy formulation related to population dynamics, health outcomes, and socio-economic impacts.\n\n9. Recognize Achievements: Acknowledge achievements in population research, advocacy, and initiatives contributing to global efforts in achieving sustainable population growth and development.\n\n10. Mobilize Civil Society: Mobilize civil society organizations, youth groups, and community leaders to participate in educational activities, campaigns, and advocacy efforts focused on population issues, fostering collective action and awareness.\n\nBy focusing on these objectives, World Population Day aims to catalyze action and collaboration towards a more equitable, healthy, and sustainable future for all.\n\nSince its inaugural celebration on July 11, 1990, World Population Day has served as a critical platform for global engagement and advocacy. It brings together UNFPA country offices, governments, and civil society organizations worldwide to address demographic challenges and promote sustainable development goals.\n\nEach year, World Population Day activities underscore the importance of understanding and responding to population issues. It fosters dialogue on topics such as family planning, gender equality, maternal health, and youth empowerment, aiming to ensure equitable access to healthcare and education for all individuals.\n\nThe Day's significance lies in its role as a catalyst for policy reforms and community initiatives aimed at achieving demographic balance and sustainable development. By raising awareness and promoting inclusive practices, World Population Day continues to contribute to a more equitable and resilient global society.\n\nThe Population of the whole world is rising so rapidly that soon it will be out of hand and to tackle this situation we need to know the concept about population control and raise awareness amongst the people.\n\nPopulation growth patterns have evolved significantly over the decades. From 3 billion in 1959, the global population doubled to 6 billion by 1999, marking a period of rapid expansion. However, the growth rate has since slowed compared to its peak in the late 1960s, when annual growth was around 2%.\n\nAs of 2024, the growth rate has stabilized at approximately 0.91% per year, resulting in an increase of about 73 million people annually. Despite this decline, projections indicate that the world population is on track to reach 9 billion by 2037 and 10 billion by 2057. These trends highlight a shift towards slower yet consistent population growth, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable development and efficient resource management to accommodate the expanding global population.", "source": {"uri": "pratidintime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pratidin Time"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Development Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_and_reproductive_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual and reproductive health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goal 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population dynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goal_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goal 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_depletion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resource depletion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resource management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/pratidintime%2F2024-07%2F46397efd-5fe0-458e-a9fd-3ba87d7a90de%2FWhatsApp%20Image%202024-07-10%20at%205.17.01%20PM%20(2).jpeg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 583, "textEnd": 590}, {"amb": false, "date": "1990-07-11", "textStart": 3572, "textEnd": 3585}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 78, "textEnd": 85}, {"amb": false, "date": "1990-12-", "textStart": 842, "textEnd": 855}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The United Nations Development Program's Governing Council established World Population Day in 1989 to highlight the impacts of the growing population. The United Nations General Assembly later formalized the day in 1990.\n\nThe growing population puts a strain on global resources. World Population Day 2024 emphasizes the need for sustainable development practices to ensure a healthy planet and society for future generations. It highlights the critical issues of resource depletion, environmental degradation, and social inequalities due to population growth.\n\nThe growing population presents a multitude of challenges. There is an increasing demand for food, water, and energy due to the pressure on healthcare, education, and housing, the impact is far-reaching. Unequal resource distribution and social inequities are further exacerbated, particularly in developing nations. Issues like human trafficking and child labor become more prevalent as populations grow.\n\nWhile the global population continues to rise, the growth rate has slowed significantly compared to the peak period of the late 1960s. The annual growth rate is approximately 0.91%, adding around 73 million people annually. This is a significant decrease from the 2% growth rate observed in the late 1960s. Despite this slowdown, the world's population is projected to reach 9 billion by 2037 and 10 billion by 2057.\n\nWorld Population Day 2024 sheds light on the importance of accurate and inclusive population data. Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in gathering, analyzing, and using population data disaggregated by factors like age, ethnicity, and gender. However, the day serves as a reminder that marginalized communities remain undercounted. This lack of data had a profound impact on their well-being and marginalized their concerns.\n\nWorld Population Day 2024 is a call to action. It urges policymakers, organizations, and individuals to work together toward a sustainable future. We must promote responsible resource management, equitable distribution, and the protection of human rights.", "source": {"uri": "krishijagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "krishijagran.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Development Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_depletion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resource depletion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://kj1bcdn.b-cdn.net/media/99034/population-day.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The world's population, which continues to grow at varying rates in different regions, has already surpassed 8 billion people.\n\nAccording to the UN Population Fund's (UNFPA) \"2024 State of World Population Report,\" global population dynamics reveal significant changes in regional growth patterns, population density, and urbanization rates. As populations age globally, Europe, North America, and parts of Asia are seeing rising elderly proportions, posing challenges for healthcare, retirement plans, and labor dynamics.\n\nFollowing the acceptance of a proposal by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to the UN General Assembly in 1989, July 11 is celebrated annually as \"World Population Day\" to raise awareness of population-related issues.\n\nAnadolu Agency compiled information from UN sources on the current state of the world population, including regional growth and decline trends, in observance of World Population Day.\n\n10.3% of global population aged 65 and over\n\nAccording to UNFPA data, the global share of people aged 65 and over has nearly doubled from 5.5% in 1974 to 10.3% in 2024. This figure is projected to reach 20.7% by 2074, with the number of those aged 80 and over more than tripling. Currently, developed countries have the highest proportion of elderly populations, while developing countries are typically witnessing rapid population aging. Global population aging is linked to improvements in average life expectancy and declines in fertility rates in many countries.\n\nGlobal fertility rate declining\n\nGlobal population growth is expected to continue at a slow pace through the 2080s. The global fertility rate has dropped to about 2.3 children per woman, influenced by shifts in family planning, education, and economic conditions. Developed regions such as North America and Europe have a combined population of 1.277 billion, with an average fertility rate of 1.5 children per woman. In contrast, less developed regions spanning Asia, Africa, and Latin America accommodate 6.842 billion people, with higher fertility rates averaging 2.4 children per woman.\n\nPopulation trends in Africa and Asia\n\nAfrica remains the fastest-growing region, with significant population increases expected in countries like Nigeria, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo due to high fertility rates and improved healthcare. Population growth remains high in East and Southern Africa, with a population of 688 million, and in West and Central Africa, with a population of 516 million.\n\nIn Asia, countries like India and China are seeing slower population growth due to declining fertility rates, while Southeast Asian nations such as Indonesia and the Philippines maintain moderate growth. In Europe, low fertility rates, an aging population, and migration trends are causing population decline or stagnation. Countries like Germany, Italy, and Russia are facing challenges with shrinking workforces and rising dependency ratios.\n\nRegional population density\n\nGlobal population density varies significantly, with some regions becoming densely populated while others remain sparsely populated. Urban areas now host over 55% of the global population, and this proportion is expected to increase further. Cities like Tokyo, New Delhi, and Shanghai accommodate millions of residents in relatively small areas. In contrast, countries such as Canada, Australia, and Russia have large territories with sparse populations due to geographical and climatic conditions.\n\nMaternal deaths decreased by 34% in 20 years\n\nUNFPA T\u00fcrkiye Representative Mariam A. Khan told Anadolu that this year's World Population Day theme is \"Threads of Hope,\" chosen in light of the six years remaining until the deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2030. Khan noted that no region in the world is on track to achieve all the goals, emphasizing the need to identify ways to accelerate progress.\n\nKhan emphasized that according to the 2024 State of World Population Report, there has been a 34% decrease in maternal deaths from 2000 to 2020, which is a significant achievement. She stated, \"Now that's really good. A similar one-third decline has happened in adolescent pregnancies. Now, these are things to celebrate. At the same time, however, the report is showing us that every day 800 women die from preventable causes of maternal deaths.\"\n\nDomestic violence persists worldwide\n\nKhan emphasized the importance of investing in solutions in the right places, stating, \"162 countries have passed laws preventing domestic violence, that's incredibly impressive. Those laws exist, but are they being implemented? Are women's lives actually being saved? The data is showing us, in almost every country in the world, that there's still work to be done.\"\n\nShe emphasized that investing in women's safety is not only a human rights imperative but also crucial economically for families and individuals. The report shows that disabled women are ten times more likely to experience violence, indicating reduced access to services for those from different communities, she highlighted.\n\n\"Every nation's most important capital is its people. And if we invest in the men, the women, the young women, the young men, and the children's education, with skills for the future, we're going to be in a much better place,\" she added.

The global human population had peaked up to d 8.0 billion in mid-November 2022 from an estimated 2.5 billion people in 1950, adding 1 billion people since 2010 and 2 billion since 1998. It is expected to increase by nearly 2 billion persons in the next 30 years, from the current 8 billion to 9.7 billion in 2050 and could peak at nearly 10.4 billion in the mid-2080s. If we see the distribution of global population by continent (2023), we see that the major share is of Asia (59.18%) followed by Africa (18.4%), Europe (9.29%), Latin America and Carribean (8.14%), North America (4.68%) and Oceania (0.58%). This dramatic growth has been driven by a number of factors. The main factors include an increase in no. of persons surviving to reproductive age, quality healthcare leading to a gradual increase in human lifespan, increase in food grains production, increasing urbanization and accelerating migration. Major changes in fertility rate have accompanied this growth. According to the World Population Prospects (2022), global fertility is projected to fall from 2.3 children per woman in 2021 to 2.1 in 2050. It is here pertinent to mention that India has now left China behind to achieve the distinction of being the most populous country in the world.\n\nOverall, significant gains in life expectancy have been achieved in recent years. Globally, life expectancy at birth is expected to rise from 72.8 years in 2019 to 77.2 years in 2050. While considerable progress has been made in closing the longevity differential between countries, large gaps remain. In 2021, life expectancy at birth in the least developed countries lags 7 years behind the global average, due largely to persistently high levels of child and maternal mortality, as well as violence, conflict and the continuing impact of the HIV epidemic. Global migration is a much smaller component of population change than births or deaths. However, in some countries and areas that send or receive large numbers of economic migrants and those affected by refugee flows the impact of migration on population size is significant.\n\nIf we analyze the population growth in the world, we find that a tremendous change occurred with the industrial revolution; whereas it had taken all of human history until around 1800 for world population to reach one billion, the second billion was achieved in only 130 years (1930), the third billion in 30 years (1960), the fourth billion in 15 years (1974), and the fifth billion in only 13 years (1987). During the 20th century alone, the population in the world has grown from 1.65 billion to 6 billion. The rapid recent increase in human population has created concern. The annual growth rate reached its peak in the late 1960s, when it was at around 2%. The increasing population poses critical challenges to achieve sustainable development, health, and well-being of all. It is a cause of concern for all of us. This is because the planet has also a carrying capacity and the increasing population has put severe pressure on the already scarce resources on this planet. Many social scientists think earth has a maximum carrying capacity of 9 billion to 10 billion people. The eminent Harvard University sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson, bases his estimate on calculations of the Earth's available resources.\n\nTo focus attention on the urgency and importance of population issues, the 'World Population Day' was established by the then Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1989 as an outgrowth of the interest generated by the Day of Five Billion, which was observed on 11 July 1987. The 'Five Billion Day' on 11th July, 1987 was the day when the world's population reached 5 billion. This day was suggested by Dr. K. C. Zachariah when population reached five billion and when he worked as Senior Demographer at World Bank. The World Population Day also calls for global attention to the unfinished business of the 1994 'International Conference on Population and Development'. It is now almost thirty years since that landmark conference, where 179 governments recognized that reproductive health and gender equality are essential for achieving sustainable development. World population Day obviously reminds us to look at the current population and population issues that influence how peoples live now.\n\nOverpopulation is a major issue given the unsustainable rate at which the world's resources are being depleted. It is important to understand how population expansion impacts the environment and development. The ever-expanding population also brings with it the attention to be given to health problems that women face during pregnancy and childbirth, highlighting the importance of gender equality, family planning, and maternal health. Another issue is that the strains of population pressure have led to increase in frequency of terrible crimes against human rights and gender equality. Abuses such as child labour and increase in incidences of human trafficking have not yet been totally controlled.\n\nPopulation issues disproportionately affect people in developing countries. People living in very poor countries have a life expectancy that's about 20 years shorter than people in rich developed countries. One third of population growth is due to unplanned pregnancies which often happen when peoples are lacking education and family planning services. This day is also a day to set up standards where we can achieve the targets set under Sustainable Development Goals 2030. Our approach towards the fairer sex should be non discriminatory. Nothing should be cramped on the basis of race, sex, language, religion, national origin, age, and economic status, place of residence, disability status, marital status, sexual orientation or gender identity. Safeguarding the health and rights particularly of women and girls deserves a special focus. It is essential to ensure that there is no disruption to health services like timely vaccination, availability of contraceptives and health insurance services. It is also necessary that child social evils like child marriage, gender-based violence in all forms and other gender specific social issues are eliminated through legislation, counseling or other means.\n\nEvery country should also ensure that the relevant commodities and services are available and accessible to everyone and that these should be acceptable. It also should be binding upon the countries to ensure the active participation of individuals in decisions that affect them including health issues. We should also use this occasion to educate and aware the common masses about the various issues pertaining to the rising population and to mobilize political will and resources to address the problem. For the last so many years, this global day has been instrumental in raising awareness and promoting policies and programs that support sustainable development and the well-being of all individuals. The significance of this day is that it sparks discussions about how rising population and its dynamics impact socio-economic development, environmental sustainability, and individual well-being. It is also a reminder that our growing population presents both challenges and opportunities that require our pro-active measures and the way out to challenges posed by increasing population lies in family planning, gender equality, poverty, maternal health and human rights.\n\n(The author writes on agriculture and social issues)", "source": {"uri": "dailyexcelsior.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jammu Kashmir Latest News | Tourism | Breaking News J&K"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daily_excelsior@dailyexcelsior.com", "name": "Daily Excelsior", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_developed_countries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Least developed countries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Total fertility rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maternal death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Longevity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oceania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urbanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociobiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sociobiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Population_and_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Conference on Population and Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._O._Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E.

This day serves as a crucial reminder of the challenges and opportunities presented by our growing global population (1 \u2714Trusted Source\n\nWorld Population Day\n\nGo to source). Established by the United Nations in 1989, World Population Day was a direct response to the surging population reaching a milestone of five billion on July 11, 1987. It aims to raise awareness about population issues and their impact on sustainable development.\n\nThe theme for World Population Day 2024 is \"Interwoven Lives, Threads of Hope: Ending inequalities in sexual and reproductive health and rights.\"\n\nThis year's World Population Day focuses on a critical issue: ensuring everyone is counted in official data. This might seem like a technicality, but for marginalized communities, the lack of data has real-world consequences.\n\nMillions remain uncounted, making them invisible in government programs and health initiatives. This is particularly harmful in the area of sexual and reproductive health. Without accurate data on these communities, it's difficult to understand their needs and challenges, hindering progress in delivering essential healthcare services.\n\nWorld Population Day 2024 calls for a global commitment to \"Count Everyone\". By including everyone in data collection efforts, we can ensure that all individuals, regardless of background, have the opportunity to exercise their rights, access healthcare, and reach their full potential. Only then can we achieve the goal of leaving no one behind.\n\nThe idea for World Population Day originated from Dr. KC Zachariah. Following the observation of \"Five Billion Day\" in 1987, the Governing Council of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) recognized the need for continued focus on population issues. The UN General Assembly officially endorsed World Population Day in 1990. Since then, the day has been marked by various events and initiatives around the world, raising awareness and promoting dialogue on critical population concerns.\n\nWorld Population Day is significant for several reasons:\n\nRaising Awareness: It brings global attention to the challenges posed by population growth, such as resource depletion, environmental degradation, and social inequalities.\n\nPromoting Sustainable Development: The day emphasizes the link between population issues and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the UN. These goals aim to address global challenges like poverty, hunger, and climate change, all of which are impacted by population dynamics.\n\nHighlighting Human Rights: World Population Day underscores the importance of sexual and reproductive health and rights for individuals, particularly women and girls. Ensuring access to these rights empowers individuals and contributes to a more equitable society.\n\nDriving Action: The day serves as a catalyst for action at various levels - governments, NGOs, and individuals can all play a role in promoting responsible population policies and addressing inequalities.\n\nBy promoting a deeper understanding of population issues and their interconnectedness with development challenges, World Population Day paves the way for a more sustainable and equitable future for all.\n\nReference:\n\nSource-Medindia", "source": {"uri": "medindia.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medindia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_and_reproductive_health_and_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual and reproductive health and rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Development Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_depletion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Resource depletion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Population dynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.medindia.net/health-images/people9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 14, "textEnd": 23}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 411, "textEnd": 418}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

This day was established by the United Nations in 1989 and commemorates the \"Day of Five Billion\" when the world's population crossed the 5 billion mark.\n\nThe executive director of United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Dr Natalia Kanem on July 1, 2024,stated, \"World Population Day 2024 is a moment to ask who is still going uncounted and why - and what this costs individuals, societies and our global efforts to leave no one behind. It is also a moment for all of us to commit to doing more to ensure that our data systems capture the full range of human diversity so that everyone is seen, can exercise their human rights and can reach their full potential.\"\n\nThe theme for the day changes annually and is decided by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in coordination with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).\n\nThe theme for this year's is 'To Leave No One Behind, Count Everyone.'\n\nAccording to United Nations: \"Over the past 30 years, we've improved how we collect and use population data, leading to better health care and rights. However, marginalized communities are still underrepresented. This World Population Day, we focus on ensuring all groups are counted and visible, highlighting the importance of inclusive data systems to advance progress for everyone. Everyone counts, and our collective progress depends on capturing the full diversity of humanity.\"\n\nThe history of the World Population Day goes back to 1980s. It was on July 11, 1987, when the world population reached approximately five billion. This day brought global focus to issues related to sustainable development, resource management, and the dynamics of population expansion.\n\nIn 1989, the UNDP Governing Councilestablished the Day to be observed annually on July 11.The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted Resolution 45/216 in December 1990, formally establishing the annual observance of the Day. The first World Population Day was celebrated on July 11, 1990, with participation from over 90 countries.\n\nThis day is celebrated to raise awareness about the issues of the global population.

The world's population, which continues to grow at varying rates in different regions, has already surpassed 8 billion people.\n\nAccording to the UN Population Fund's (UNFPA) \"2024 State of World Population Report,\" global population dynamics reveal significant changes in regional growth patterns, population density, and urbanization rates. As populations age globally, Europe, North America, and parts of Asia are seeing rising elderly proportions, posing challenges for healthcare, retirement plans, and labor dynamics.\n\nFollowing the acceptance of a proposal by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to the UN General Assembly in 1989, July 11 is celebrated annually as \"World Population Day\" to raise awareness of population-related issues.\n\nAnadolu Agency compiled information from UN sources on the current state of the world population, including regional growth and decline trends, in observance of World Population Day.\n\n10.3% of global population aged 65 and over\n\nAccording to UNFPA data, the global share of people aged 65 and over has nearly doubled from 5.5% in 1974 to 10.3% in 2024. This figure is projected to reach 20.7% by 2074, with the number of those aged 80 and over more than tripling. Currently, developed countries have the highest proportion of elderly populations, while developing countries are typically witnessing rapid population aging. Global population aging is linked to improvements in average life expectancy and declines in fertility rates in many countries.\n\nGlobal fertility rate declining\n\nGlobal population growth is expected to continue at a slow pace through the 2080s. The global fertility rate has dropped to about 2.3 children per woman, influenced by shifts in family planning, education, and economic conditions. Developed regions such as North America and Europe have a combined population of 1.277 billion, with an average fertility rate of 1.5 children per woman. In contrast, less developed regions spanning Asia, Africa, and Latin America accommodate 6.842 billion people, with higher fertility rates averaging 2.4 children per woman.\n\nPopulation trends in Africa and Asia\n\nAfrica remains the fastest-growing region, with significant population increases expected in countries like Nigeria, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo due to high fertility rates and improved healthcare. Population growth remains high in East and Southern Africa, with a population of 688 million, and in West and Central Africa, with a population of 516 million.\n\nIn Asia, countries like India and China are seeing slower population growth due to declining fertility rates, while Southeast Asian nations such as Indonesia and the Philippines maintain moderate growth. In Europe, low fertility rates, an aging population, and migration trends are causing population decline or stagnation. Countries like Germany, Italy, and Russia are facing challenges with shrinking workforces and rising dependency ratios.\n\nRegional population density\n\nGlobal population density varies significantly, with some regions becoming densely populated while others remain sparsely populated. Urban areas now host over 55% of the global population, and this proportion is expected to increase further. Cities like Tokyo, New Delhi, and Shanghai accommodate millions of residents in relatively small areas. In contrast, countries such as Canada, Australia, and Russia have large territories with sparse populations due to geographical and climatic conditions.\n\nMaternal deaths decreased by 34% in 20 years\n\nUNFPA T\u00fcrkiye Representative Mariam A. Khan told Anadolu that this year's World Population Day theme is \"Threads of Hope,\" chosen in light of the six years remaining until the deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2030. Khan noted that no region in the world is on track to achieve all the goals, emphasizing the need to identify ways to accelerate progress.\n\nKhan emphasized that according to the 2024 State of World Population Report, there has been a 34% decrease in maternal deaths from 2000 to 2020, which is a significant achievement. She stated, \"Now that's really good. A similar one-third decline has happened in adolescent pregnancies. Now, these are things to celebrate. At the same time, however, the report is showing us that every day 800 women die from preventable causes of maternal deaths.\"\n\nDomestic violence persists worldwide\n\nKhan emphasized the importance of investing in solutions in the right places, stating, \"162 countries have passed laws preventing domestic violence, that's incredibly impressive. Those laws exist, but are they being implemented? Are women's lives actually being saved? The data is showing us, in almost every country in the world, that there's still work to be done.\"\n\nShe emphasized that investing in women's safety is not only a human rights imperative but also crucial economically for families and individuals. The report shows that disabled women are ten times more likely to experience violence, indicating reduced access to services for those from different communities, she highlighted.\n\n\"Every nation's most important capital is its people. And if we invest in the men, the women, the young women, the young men, and the children's education, with skills for the future, we're going to be in a much better place,\" she added.", "source":

Established by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1989, this day focuses on the challenges and opportunities associated with population growth. World Population Day was inspired by the \"Day of Five Billion\" on July 11, 1987, when the world's population reached approximately five billion. Recognising the importance of addressing population issues, the United Nations General Assembly in 1990 decided to establish World Population Day on July 11. Since then, the day has been a platform to promote awareness and action on various population-related concerns, including family planning, gender equality, and sustainable development. Commemorating World Population Day 2024, we'll learn about the 10 most populated countries in the world and explore their demographic dynamics.\n\nIndia is the most populous country globally, with a population of more than 1.44 billion. The country has surpassed China in 2022, ranking as the most populated one worldwide. India's demographic landscape is defined by a median age of 28.2 years, indicating a young population as compared to other countries. The country's demographic trends depend upon rapid urbanisation, improvements in health care and socio-cultural norms encompassing family size and gender roles.\n\nChina is the second-most populated country in the world, with a population of around 1.43 billion. The country's demographic landscape is characterised by a median age of 39.0, which indicates an ageing population compared to other nations. This trend is attributed to declining fertility rates, improvements in healthcare, and socio-economic developments impacting family structure and lifestyle.\n\nThe United States, with a population of around 339 million, is the third most populous country. Known for its cultural diversity and economic influence, the U.S. faces issues related to immigration, healthcare, and social inequality. The population growth is driven by both natural increase and immigration. With a median of 38.1 years, the demographic landscape is evolving, slowly leaning towards the older population.\n\nIndonesia, the largest archipelago, has a population of approximately 277 million. As the most populous country in Southeast Asia, Indonesia has a median age of 29.9 years, and its demographic landscape is notably young compared to other countries. However, the country faces challenges such as urban overcrowding, environmental degradation, and the inability to provide adequate infrastructure and services to its citizens.\n\nWith a population of around 240 million, Pakistan tops the list at number five. The country's demographic landscape is characterised by a median age of 20.6 years and is relatively towards the youthful population. Rapid population growth, coupled with economic and political instability, presents significant challenges. Efforts are being made to improve healthcare, education, and economic opportunities to manage the growing population effectively.\n\nNigeria, the most populous country in Africa, has a population of about 223 million. With a median age of 17.0 years, the demographic landscape is relatively young compared to other countries worldwide. Nigeria's population continues to grow owing to its high fertility rate. Besides, the country faces challenges in terms of poverty, education, and healthcare, but it also has immense potential for economic growth.\n\nBrazil's population is approximately 216 million. The median age of the country is 32.04 years and its demographic landscape indicates an ageing population. As the largest country in South America, Brazil grapples with issues such as urbanisation, deforestation, and social inequality. Despite these challenges, Brazil remains a significant cultural and economic player on the global stage.\n\nBangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with a population of around 172 million. The country has made remarkable progress in areas like healthcare and education, yet it faces ongoing challenges related to urbanisation, climate change, and resource management. With a median age of 27.1 years, the demographic landscape is notably young.\n\nRussia's population is about 144 million. The country faces a declining population growth rate and an ageing demographic with a median age of 39.2 years. Economic disparities, healthcare challenges, and regional population distribution are vital issues that Russia must address to sustain its development.\n\nMexico, with a population of roughly 128 million, is the tenth most populous country. Its young population and strategic economic position offer significant growth potential. The country has a median age of 30.2 years and has a young demographic landscape as compared to other countries. However, due to rapid urbanisation, Mexico deals with issues such as crime, healthcare, and economic inequality.\n\nWorld Population Day reminds us of the importance of understanding and addressing the complexities of global population dynamics. The top 10 most populated countries each face unique challenges and opportunities shaped by their demographic trends. By focusing on sustainable development, healthcare, education, and economic growth, these nations can navigate the complexities of population growth and contribute to a balanced and prosperous global future.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score":

There can be no road to equality, peace, or prosperity without inclusiveness. With a fast-growing world population, some regions experience a high demographic boom, whereas other countries have to manage with rapidly aging populations; with climate change and conflict leading to increased vulnerabilities, populations need to be counted to ensure actionable data. It is a very critical tool to respond to the needs of marginalized communities effectively and making sure that nobody is left behind.\n\nWorld Population Day is observed on July 11 every year, serving as a venue for highlighting the problems and opportunities in the tapestry of our population. More than just a date, it is rather a call to action concerning the complexities that surround reproductive health, family planning, and gender equality noted in the United Nations calendar. It's a day for reflecting on our shared future, calling on nations and communities by engaging in dialogues and provoking innovation toward sustainable development. In just 200 years, the global population skyrocketed from a billion to expanding to seven times that number, a growth once thought to take millennia. In effect, these conversations set World Population Day to light the pathway toward a more balanced and resilient tomorrow.\n\nGlobal Engagement on World Population Day\n\nOn World Population Day, attention is brought to important demographic trends across the globe by highlighting population growth projections in 2024 promoted by China, India, and the United States. The United Nations mentions that although progress has been realized over the last three decades in the collection and use of population data, there is a general underrepresentation of marginalized groups. This year, the focus is on ensuring that everyone is visible in data systems as the route to universal progress; this means considering everyone being visible as key to getting closer to achieving equitable development and rights. It is celebrated globally by all nations with open forums, online seminars, conferences, workshops, and education regarding this day. Also, individuals contributed to it by posting on social media, distributing banners, and making slogans to create awareness.\n\nFinal Note\n\nOn World Population Day, the attention worldwide goes to raising awareness about important demographic trends, including population growth projections. In the year 2024, China, India, and the United States are the countries that lead in population size worldwide, and this is the pace set for all global efforts towards sustainable development.", "source": {"uri": "siliconindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Silicon India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_and_reproductive_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual and reproductive health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Direct action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}], "image": "32tu7ATx.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 686, "textEnd": 693}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The size of any population must fit within those limits.\n\n\"If a population grows, resources will be directed to providing for the basic needs of its new citizens, rather than lifting the standard of living of the whole community to a point where everyone thrives.\n\n\"The five poorest countries in the world - Burundi, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Somalia - all have very high population growth rates. South Sudan, for instance, grows by 4.8 per cent annually which means the population doubles every 15 years.\n\n\"You cannot have sustainable development in these conditions. Women's energies will be focussed on the needs of her family if she has six or seven children, rather than on the broader economy or community.\n\n\"Health care should be a basic human right and yet these high-population growth countries fail to provide it. South Sudan, for instance, has one of the world's highest maternal mortality rates. The DRC lacks modern healthcare. Somalia's fertility rate of over six births per woman has put further strain on the country's already poor healthcare.\n\n\"In 2023, with an immigration-driven population growth rate of 2.5 per cent, Australia struggled to provide basic health, education and housing for all, and continues to fail on those fronts.\n\n\"Last year, 651,200 people were added to Australia's population, 84 per cent from net overseas migration. Growth required building over a quarter million new dwellings, just to house all the new people, be they born here or immigrant, but only 170,000 dwellings were delivered.\n\n\"The vast amounts of private and public money required to cater for growth could be better spent on education and healthcare, were the population not growing.\n\n\"If people's needs are to be properly met everywhere, population growth must end, nationally and globally.\"\n\n/Public Release.

This year, it highlights the importance of population data gathering in understanding problems, developing solutions, and making progress.\n\nOver the past three decades, societies around the world have made remarkable progress in improving population data gathering, analysis, and use.\n\nNew population figures, disaggregated by age, ethnicity, gender, and other factors, now reflect the diversity of the societies more accurately.\n\nThese advancements have significantly enhanced the delivery of health care globally, leading to substantial improvements in sexual and reproductive health and the ability to exercise rights and choices.\n\nIncreasingly, new technologies are enabling more detailed and timely measurement of people's experiences than ever before.\n\nHowever, the most marginalized communities remain underrepresented in data, profoundly affecting their lives and well-being.\n\nWorld Population Day 2024 is a moment to ask who is still going uncounted and why - and what this costs individuals, societies, and our global efforts to leave no one behind.\n\nIt is also a moment for all of us to commit to doing more to ensure that our data systems capture the full range of human diversity so that everyone is seen, can exercise their human rights, and can reach their full potential.\n\nTo realize the rights and choices of those on the margins of our societies, we must count them - because everyone counts. Our rich human tapestry is only as strong as its weakest thread. When data and other systems work for those on the margins, they work for everyone. This is how we accelerate progress for all.\n\nPopulation policies\n\nThe National Population Day is annually observed on May 19 to mark the date the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, announced general policies on population as per the Constitution.\n\nUnderscoring the significant role of the population in national authority, general population policies were announced to compensate for the decrease in population growth and fertility rate over the past years (ended on March 19).\n\nKeeping in mind the positive role of the population in the development of the country, it is necessary to make comprehensive plans for the economic, social, and cultural growth of the country in accordance with the population policies, the leader said.\n\nIt is also necessary to share the task among the relevant institutions and government bodies to take the necessary measures with accuracy, and strength, and then report the results of continuous monitoring of the implementation of policies.\n\nTen years following the announcement of these policies, the administration of the late President Ebrahim Raisi was successful in implementing them with the approval and enforcement of the Law on Family and Youth Support.\n\nAccording to statistics, with the formation of the National Population Headquarters, holding continuous meetings, and following up on the actions, the law was implemented successfully in the past 30 months.\n\nThe law has tried to prevent the population decline by considering a series of incentives for families.\n\nThe incentives include providing families with plots of land free of charge, free insurance coverage, loans for house construction and childbearing, and building more infertility treatment centers.\n\nAccording to the health ministry, since the implementation of the law, the number of births among mothers aged 20 to 24 has notably increased.\n\nThe rate of mothers giving birth to three children increased from 16 percent in the Iranian year 1398 (March 2019-March 2020) to 18.97 percent in 1402 (March 2023 -March 2024) and even the fourth childbirth increased from 5 percent to about 7 percent.\n\nThe health ministry's responsibilities in the field of health and education are well-defined and it has successfully implemented more than 95 percent of its tasks in the youth law.\n\nPopulation is one of the important and key points in the 7th national development plan (2023-2027).", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tehran Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, to harness this potential, we must ensure that our youth have access to quality education, healthcare, and employment opportunities which are significantly affected by imbalance between the available resources and the size of our country's population,\" President Secretariat Press Wing, in a press release, quoted the president as saying..\n\nThe president said Pakistan faced significant challenges in managing its population growth, which directly affected their resources and public services.\n\nDespite being water-abundant at the time of independence, he said, they were now one of the water-stressed countries in the world; the agricultural land was being converted into housing areas, threatening their food security and consequently affecting the nutritional status of their citizens especially children.\n\n\"This stark reality underscores the urgent need to address population growth through effective family planning and reproductive health services. Our total fertility rate and high maternal and infant mortality rates indicate that we must redouble our efforts to improve healthcare services, particularly for women and children,\" he stressed.\n\nBy prioritizing health and family planning initiatives, President Zardari said they could ensure a healthier, more sustainable future for the nation.\n\nTo foster an environment where every Pakistani could succeed, it was crucial to manage population growth by aligning their resources with the population size, he added.\n\nThe president said that the new national narrative of 'Tawazun' approved by all stakeholders, including the Ulema, invites people to practice family planning voluntarily enabling parents to fulfill the fundamental rights of children.\n\nAchieving 'Tawazun' between population and resources ensured genuine prosperity. A well-balanced and sustainable population could drive economic growth, improve living standards, and alleviate poverty, he added.\n\nThe president said \"On this World Population Day, I urge all stakeholders, including government bodies, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector, to collaborate in addressing the population challenges we face.\"\n\nIn this regard, he said, he would like to highlight the critical importance of inclusive data in the realm of family planning.\n\nAs they strived to improve health outcomes and empower individuals and communities, it was essential to recognize that data inclusivity was a cornerstone for informed decision-making and effective policy development, he emphasised.\n\nThe president said by capturing data that reflected the experiences of different genders, ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnicities, and abilities, they could work towards a future where everyone had equal opportunities to progress.\n\n\"In this way, together we can achieve the vision of Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed that she shared with the world community at International Conference on Population and Development Cairo 1994. She said, \"I dream of a Pakistan, of an Asia, of a world where every pregnancy is planned and every child conceived is nurtured, loved, educated and supported,\" the president added.", "source": {"uri": "app.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press Of Pakistan"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asif_Ali_Zardari", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asif Ali Zardari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Total fertility rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infant mortality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Population_and_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Conference on Population and Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benazir Bhutto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equal opportunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.app.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/zardari44-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 361, "textEnd": 370}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

P. Nadda, who called for \"healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy for the health and well-being of mother and child.\"\n\nPopulation increases also create congestion and deplete human health resources.\n\n\"It also adds load to our already overburdened infrastructure, deprives people of basic amenities, causes scarcity of water, problems related to hygiene and sewage,\" M Wali, Senior Consultant, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, told IANS.\n\nOverpopulation can also worsen health care indices like morbidity and mortality as preventive and screening health care needs of the population (especially the vulnerable sections like women, children, and elderly) are not adequately met.\n\n\"Uplifting women is an efficient strategy to keep the overpopulation problem in check. Educated women are more likely to exercise their reproductive rights, that is, use contraception and motivate their partners for the same, plan families, and consider termination of undesired pregnancies.

The size of any population must fit within those limits.\n\n\"If a population grows, resources will be directed to providing for the basic needs of its new citizens, rather than lifting the standard of living of the whole community to a point where everyone thrives.\n\n\"The five poorest countries in the world - Burundi, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Somalia - all have very high population growth rates. South Sudan, for instance, grows by 4.8 per cent annually which means the population doubles every 15 years.\n\n\"You cannot have sustainable development in these conditions. Women's energies will be focussed on the needs of her family if she has six or seven children, rather than on the broader economy or community.\n\n\"Health care should be a basic human right and yet these high-population growth countries fail to provide it. South Sudan, for instance, has one of the world's highest maternal mortality rates. The DRC lacks modern healthcare. Somalia's fertility rate of over six births per woman has put further strain on the country's already poor healthcare.\n\n\"In 2023, with an immigration-driven population growth rate of 2.5 per cent, Australia struggled to provide basic health, education and housing for all, and continues to fail on those fronts.\n\n\"Last year, 651,200 people were added to Australia's population, 84 per cent from net overseas migration. Growth required building over a quarter million new dwellings, just to house all the new people, be they born here or immigrant, but only 170,000 dwellings were delivered.\n\n\"The vast amounts of private and public money required to cater for growth could be better spent on education and healthcare, were the population not growing.\n\n\"If people's needs are to be properly met everywhere, population growth must end, nationally and globally.\"\n\nAbout us:\n\nSPA is an independent not-for-profit organisation seeking to protect the environment and our quality of life by ending population growth in Australia and globally, while rejecting racism and involuntary population control.

He called upon scholars and intellectuals to play an active role in educating the youth about family planning to prevent rapid population growth.\n\nThe seminar was attended by Secretary Population Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mutasim Bilah, Director General Population, and other officials from the department, as well as people from various walks of life.\n\nIn his address, Malik Liaqat Ali said that the main purpose of celebrating this day was to draw the people's attention to the problems arising due to the population growth and lack of resources.\n\nThe solution to the economic and social problems of the growing population is essential. All efforts for development and prosperity prove futile when every member of society lacks access to basic needs. For Pakistan to develop and stand among the developed countries, sustainable and effective family planning must become a part of the national security model, he said.\n\nHe further added that controlling the population increase was crucial for maintaining a good and prosperous life. He pointed out that Bangladesh, which once had a higher population than Pakistan, has successfully controlled its population growth through effective strategies and the support of religious circles.\n\n\"Pakistan's population will double in the coming years if not addressed, posing significant challenges for both families and the government. Overcrowded cities and poor maternal and child health are among the issues that will arise. The relationship between population growth and socio-economic development is well established\".\n\nHe said our neighboring and Muslim countries have progressed manifold by investing in family planning and reproductive health. Our progress does not match that of countries where these investments have been prioritized. We are lagging behind in many development indicators compared to our neighboring countries, he expressed\n\nHe reiterated the provincial government's commitment to family planning and reproductive health, despite the challenges ahead. He stressed the importance of partnership and cooperation with the government, people, relevant departments, and non-governmental organizations to achieve sustainable population growth for the province's development and prosperity. \"We are here to serve, and we will work for the welfare of the people as much as we can,\" he said. He assured that the government is committed to ensuring that people receive their rights, and that any kind of abuse or corruption will not be tolerated in government offices, following a zero-tolerance policy.\n\nSecretary Population Department Mutasim Ballah and other speakers also addressed the seminar, emphasizing the importance of family planning and reproductive health in achieving socio-economic development.", "source": {"uri": "app.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press Of Pakistan"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liaquat Ali Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_and_reproductive_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual and reproductive health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9_Alsacienne_de_Constructions_M\u00e9caniques", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Alsacienne de Constructions M\u00e9caniques"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peshawar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Peshawar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_needs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basic needs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.app.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Fall-Back-Image-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Peshawar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 16}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

It was established following the public interest generated by the approximate date when the world's population reached five billion on July 11, 1987. The day aims to raise awareness about important global population issues like family planning, poverty, maternal health, human rights and gender equality. The day also serves as a call to action that emphasises the urgency of addressing these issues. On World Population Day, look at the top 10 most and 10 least populated countries.\n\nChina and India, the world's most populous countries, each with over a billion people, are also significant players in the global economy. The United States, with just under 325 million residents, follows closely. The BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries, major emerging economies, are expected to dominate the 21st-century economy. Not only that, they are also among the top 10 most populous countries in the world.\n\nVatican City, one of the world's smallest internationally recognised independent states, is the least populated country globally. This is mainly due to a unique set of factors, such as limited land area, geographical isolation, resource constraints, cultural preservation efforts, political status, and historical factors, that combine to restrict large-scale population growth and expansion. These factors make Vatican City a fascinating case study in population dynamics.\n\nIn a report by the United Nations in 2022, it was projected that the global population will exceed 9.7 billion by the year 2050, an increase of almost 2 billion from the current population. The report also predicts that this growth will persist until it reaches 10.4 billion by the 2080s.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "devika_kapoor@news9live.com", "name": "Devika Kapoor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maternal health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Development Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BRIC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Direct action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/world-population-day-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 56, "textEnd": 63}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 306, "textEnd": 313}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

It has been stated that in 2023, the proportion of child population will decline, while the proportion of population aged 65 and above will increase. Additionally, Turkey's fertility rate has fallen below the average of the European Union in 2023. President Erdogan had stated that the fertility rate in Turkey is \"an existential disaster, a threat\" for the country.\n\nThe child and youth population rates have decreased in Turkey in the last 3 years, while the elderly population has increased. In 2021, children accounted for 26.9% of the population, in 2022 it was 26.5%, and in 2023 it was 26%. The elderly population was 9.7% in 2021, 9.9% in 2022, and 10.2% in 2023.\n\nAccording to the statistics compiled by the Turkish Statistical Institute from the United Nations and the Address-Based Population Registration System data, Turkey accounted for 1.1% of the world population, with a population of 85,372,377 in 2023 out of a total world population of 8,045,311,447.\n\nThe child and youth population in Turkey has decreased in the last 3 years, while the elderly population has increased. In 2021, children accounted for 26.9% of the population, which was 84,680,683. In 2022, children accounted for 26.5% of the population, which was 85,279,553. In 2023, children accounted for 26% of the population, which was 8,045,311,447. There has also been a decrease in the youth population rate. In 2021, the youth population accounted for 15.3% of the population, in 2022 it was 15.2%, and in 2023 it was 15.1%.\n\nOn the other hand, there has been an increase in the elderly population. In 2021, the elderly population accounted for 9.7% of the population in Turkey. In 2022, it was 9.9%, and in 2023, it was 10.2% of the population, consisting of people aged 65 and above.\n\nLooking at the world population, it can be seen that the child and youth population is at the same level. In 2021, children accounted for 30% of the world population, which was 7,874,965,732. In 2022, children accounted for 30% of the population, which was 7,975,105,156. In 2023, children accounted for 29.8% of the population, which was 85,372,377. The youth population rates for the age group of 15-24 were calculated as 15.4% in 2021, 15.5% in 2022, and 15.5% in 2023. The elderly population rate has also increased worldwide. In 2021, the elderly population accounted for 9.6% of the world population, in 2022 it was 9.8%, and in 2023 it was 10%.\n\nTurkey's fertility rate has also fallen below the EU average in 2023. While the fertility rate in the EU was 1.54 children in 2023, it remained at 1.51 in Turkey. Turkey's fertility rate was behind 16 out of 27 EU countries. Turkey's fertility rate was 1.62 children in 2022, while the EU average was 1.53. The fertility rate was also above the EU average in 2021, with 1.70. Turkey's fertility rate in 2001 was around 2.38.\n\nTurkey's fertility rate is also below the world average as of last year. According to UN data, the world average fertility rate was 2.31 children in 2023, and Turkey is not among the top 100 countries with a rate of 1.51.\n\nDr. Ay\u00c5\u0178e Abbaso\u00c4\u0178lu \u00c3-zg\u00c3\u00b6ren, a faculty member at Hacettepe University Institute of Population Studies, pointed out that the total fertility rate in Turkey has generally been declining since the 1950s. \u00c3-zg\u00c3\u00b6ren stated that as a result of the decline in fertility rate, the population is facing the phenomenon of aging, with a decrease in the working-age population and an increase in the elderly population, which could lead to a direct decline in the population.\n\n\u00c3-zg\u00c3\u00b6ren mentioned that the decline in fertility rate is the result of a long process and that policies to stop or slow down this trend have been on the agenda since 2008. \u00c3-zg\u00c3\u00b6ren stated that the demographic opportunity window defined by the UN as the period when \"the population over 40 years old constitutes half of the total population, the population under 15 years old is less than 30% of the total population, and the population over 65 years old is less than 15% of the total population\" is still open for Turkey, but this opportunity will last until the 2040s, and we can think of it as an approaching alarm.\n\nOn the other hand, President Erdogan recently stated in a speech that Turkey's birth statistics for 2023 are concerning. Erdogan reminded that the fertility rate, which was 2.38 in 2001, has fallen to 1.51 in 2023, which is below the replacement level of 2.1. He said, \"This is a disaster, a threat for Turkey. The current situation has gone beyond a tolerable level for our country.\"", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Statistical_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turkish Statistical Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Total fertility rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Existentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sub-replacement fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacettepe_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hacettepe University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Middle_East", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Middle East", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://foto.haberler.com/haber/2024/07/11/ulkemiz-icin-varolussal-bir-tehdit-demisti-17510257_1561_o.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

India has been estimated to have the second-largest population after China. While China contributes 18.5 per cent of the world share, India is not far behind with a 17.7 per cent share of the global Apopulation. India is projected to overtake China soon as the world's most populated country. The United States, however, has a share of 4.3 per cent, as estimated by Worldometer.\n\nAs of 2023, Nigeria's population was estimated at around 226.2 million. Sadly, the country's actual population figures have been open to conjectures, since the last census was in 2006. It was scheduled to be held in May 2023, but the exercise was rescheduled and the administration of President Bola Tinubu has yet to announce the new dates for the census.\n\nAccording to the World Population Review, Nigeria has been projected to overtake the US to become the world's third most populated country by 2051. Africa's most populous country is reckoned to increase to 380.20 million by then, 385.60 million in 2052, and 390.93 million in 2053. This is staggering.\n\nTragically, stark wealth inequality divides the country. About two-thirds of its population live below the poverty line. In 2018, the World Poverty Clock named Nigeria as the global poverty capital with 86.7 million citizens.\n\nA joint study in 2022 by the National Bureau of Statistics, the National Social Safety-Nets Coordinating Office, the UNDP, UNICEF, and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, listed 133 million as living in multidimensional poverty. In 2023, the World Bank said seven million would be added to that figure because of the cancellation of petrol subsidies and the merger of the naira exchange rates.\n\nWithout having a precise figure of Nigeria's population and commensurate plans to ensure that the country's resources will be sufficient, Nigeria has been thrown into a cycle of overconsumption spiralling towards ecological disruption and collapse.\n\n\"More people means an increased demand for food, water, housing, energy, healthcare, transportation and more\" which leads to \"ecological degradation, increased conflicts, and a higher risks of large scale disasters like pandemics,\" as stated by the Population Media Centre.\n\nA spike in population creates an incredible strain on available resources which results in high poverty levels, decreased biodiversity, increased pollution and an exacerbation of climate change. Frighteningly, Nigeria's Climate Risk profile predicts that 20 per cent of the population will be exposed to heat waves that are detrimental to human health.\n\nAt the bedrock of Nigeria's unregulated population lies the scourge of child marriages, lack of education, misconceptions about family planning, a politicisation of population counts, and religious or cultural norms that prevent many women from accessing reproductive healthcare.\n\nThe government and relevant stakeholders need to develop and implement a strategic population plan that seeks to count and ensure an adequate distribution of resources among citizens. Religious organisations and traditional institutions should collaborate with health agencies to promote awareness of reproductive rights, support the girl-child education and ensure that citizens have access to family planning.", "source": {"uri": "thecitizenng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheCitizen - It's all about you"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ezra_ikpeama@thecitizenng.com", "name": "Ezra Ikpeama", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human overpopulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Distribution of wealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Development Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty threshold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconsumption_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overconsumption (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Poverty_and_Human_Development_Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_Poverty_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multidimensional Poverty Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 44}], "image": "https://thecitizenng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Map-of-Nigeria.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

There are many myths and misconceptions about population trends and their significance -- let's explore the facts.\n\n--\n\nDue to countless headlines about declining birth rates, many believe our global population has already stopped growing, and some even believe it is shrinking. This is not true. While approximately half of all countries now have fertility rates (the number of live births per woman) at or below the replacement level of 2.1, the global rate still stands at 2.3. We passed the 8 billion milestone in November 2022, and the United Nations projects that our population will keep growing until the 2080s, likely peaking above 10 billion, with no significant decline this century.\n\nPoliticians and economists fret about low or no population growth because this leads to population aging and a smaller pool of consumers and taxpayers. Tech billionaire Elon Musk went as far as claiming that low birth rates present \"a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.\"\n\nPopulation aging is an inevitable step towards a sustainable future, and while it does present challenges, these can be lessened in very beneficial ways, such as through investment in preventive healthcare and child welfare to maximize the number of productive members of society. Our planet is finite -- failing to rein in our unhealthy addiction to infinite population and economic growth can only lead to disaster.\n\nYou might also like: How Does Overpopulation Affect Sustainability? Challenges and Solutions\n\nA surprisingly widespread argument is that there is enough room for many more people because our entire world population could fit into the state of Texas. Human Tetris is an amusing thought experiment but \"fitting\" into an area is not the same as living, let alone thriving there. At the very least, everyone needs water, food, shelter, and basic services such as education, sanitation, and healthcare. We already use almost half of the Earth's habitable land just for agriculture -- humanity needs a lot more space than just the size of our bodies.\n\nSome argue that environmental issues are entirely driven by overconsumption of resources and excessive lifestyles, rather than population increase. Consumerism in wealthy nations like the United States is undoubtedly a major cause of climate change, resource depletion, biodiversity loss, and pollution, but it's just half of the problem. Our impact on the environment is a product of how many of us there are and how much each of us consumes.\n\nIn countries where individuals' environmental footprints are still small, population pressure is often the primary driver of nature loss, and while North America and Europe are responsible for the majority of historical emissions that have precipitated the climate crisis, populous China and India are now the first and third biggest national emitters, respectively.\n\nAccording to the Global Footprint Network, if we achieve a population of 7.7 billion by 2050 instead of the 9.7 billion we are headed towards, we could move Earth Overshoot Day - the day on which humanity has used up all the resources the planet can regenerate in a year - back by 49 days, which makes it the second most powerful of their proposed solutions, after decarbonizing our economies. An analysis of all available climate solutions by Project Drawdown found that slowing population growth by removing barriers to family planning and girls' education would prevent around 69 gigatons of CO2 by 2050, representing the third most effective action to limit warming to 2C, after cutting food waste and adopting plant-based diets.\n\nMore on the topic: What Is Earth Overshoot Day?\n\nA huge misconception is that ending population growth can only be achieved through coercion. The most effective solution, as mentioned above, is the empowerment of women and girls. Wherever women have access to family planning and reproductive health services, and are free to pursue educational and career opportunities, fertility rates plummet. Unfortunately, there are still an estimated 257 million women globally with an unmet need for modern contraception, and almost half of women in developing regions have no decision-making power over their own bodies.\n\nAdvancing women's right to choose what happens to their bodies and lives is morally essential in its own right, but sadly chronically underfunded. By demonstrating how empowering women is also key to achieving sustainability, we can leverage much-needed investment.", "source": {"uri": "earth.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Earth.Org - Past |

Image: Pixabay | Representational\n\nIt is imperative to focus on the needs of women, youth, and marginalised communities that remain inadequate owing to the rising population, said experts on World Population Day on Thursday.\n\nWorld Population Day is observed every year on July 11 to raise awareness about global population issues and their impact on society. The theme for this year is \"Leave no one behind, count everyone\".\n\nWith about 142.86 crore population, India overtook China to become the world's most populous nation, according to the UNFPA's State of the World Population Report in 2023.\n\nSpeaking to IANS, Poonam Muttreja, Executive Director of the Population Foundation Of India (PFI), said even though India became the world's most populous nation, \"we have attained the replacement-level fertility rate.\"\n\n\"This means that the average number of children born per woman is sufficient to keep the population size stable from one generation to the next,\" she explained.\n\nYet, due to a large proportion of young people, the population in India will continue to grow.\n\n\"Nonetheless, we have made remarkable progress towards population stabilisation,\" Poonam said.\n\nHowever, she called for a shift in focus -- on reaching the unreached, that is, the women, young people, and marginalised communities.\n\n\"The reproductive rights, access to resources, and health and well-being outcomes of these groups remain inadequate,\" Poonam said.\n\nThere are approximately 24 million women with an unmet need for family planning, meaning they want to stop or delay childbearing but lack the access or agency to use contraception.\n\n\"The upcoming budget must increase the investment in family planning, especially in long-lasting modern contraceptives, as addressing these needs is crucial for achieving equitable and sustainable development,\" the PFI chief said.\n\nThis was also advocated by the Union Health Minister J. P.

India has been estimated to have the second-largest population after China. While China contributes 18.5 per cent of the world share, India is not far behind with a 17.7 per cent share of the global Apopulation. India is projected to overtake China soon as the world's most populated country. The United States, however, has a share of 4.3 per cent, as estimated by Worldometer.\n\nAs of 2023, Nigeria's population was estimated at around 226.2 million. Sadly, the country's actual population figures have been open to conjectures, since the last census was in 2006. It was scheduled to be held in May 2023, but the exercise was rescheduled and the administration of President Bola Tinubu has yet to announce the new dates for the census.\n\nAccording to the World Population Review, Nigeria has been projected to overtake the US to become the world's third most populated country by 2051. Africa's most populous country is reckoned to increase to 380.20 million by then, 385.60 million in 2052, and 390.93 million in 2053. This is staggering.\n\nTragically, stark wealth inequality divides the country. About two-thirds of its population live below the poverty line. In 2018, the World Poverty Clock named Nigeria as the global poverty capital with 86.7 million citizens.\n\nA joint study in 2022 by the National Bureau of Statistics, the National Social Safety-Nets Coordinating Office, the UNDP, UNICEF, and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative, listed 133 million as living in multidimensional poverty. In 2023, the World Bank said seven million would be added to that figure because of the cancellation of petrol subsidies and the merger of the naira exchange rates.\n\nWithout having a precise figure of Nigeria's population and commensurate plans to ensure that the country's resources will be sufficient, Nigeria has been thrown into a cycle of overconsumption spiralling towards ecological disruption and collapse.\n\n\"More people means an increased demand for food, water, housing, energy, healthcare, transportation and more\" which leads to \"ecological degradation, increased conflicts, and a higher risks of large scale disasters like pandemics,\" as stated by the Population Media Centre.\n\nA spike in population creates an incredible strain on available resources which results in high poverty levels, decreased biodiversity, increased pollution and an exacerbation of climate change. Frighteningly, Nigeria's Climate Risk profile predicts that 20 per cent of the population will be exposed to heat waves that are detrimental to human health.\n\nAt the bedrock of Nigeria's unregulated population lies the scourge of child marriages, lack of education, misconceptions about family planning, a politicisation of population counts, and religious or cultural norms that prevent many women from accessing reproductive healthcare.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "punch_editorial_board@punchng.com", "name": "Punch Editorial Board", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human overpopulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Distribution of wealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty threshold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconsumption_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overconsumption (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Poverty_and_Human_Development_Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_Poverty_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multidimensional Poverty Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Development Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/30192759/Bola-Tinubu.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Especially prevalent across Europe and developed Asia, this demographic trend is a consequence of declining birth rates and ageing populations and poses significant challenges to the countries affected.\n\nIn countries like Japan and Italy, where population decline has begun in 2011 and 2015, respectively, fertility rates have long fallen below the replacement level of 2.1 percent, influenced by factors such as higher education and career opportunities for women, shifts in societal norms regarding family and childbearing and an ageing overall population.\n\nCountries with declining populations face a number of challenges, both economic and social. Economically, a shrinking workforce can lead to labor shortages, reduced productivity and increased pressure on social welfare systems. With fewer working-age individuals to support a growing elderly population, the financial burden on pension systems and healthcare services intensifies. Socially, a declining population can result in the depopulation of rural areas, shrinking communities and the ensuing challenges in maintaining infrastructure and public services.\n\nAddressing these issues requires comprehensive strategies and strategies. Raising the retirement age or increasing taxes/social contributions can help alleviate the financial burdens associated with a demographic imbalance. Policies to support work-life balance and affordable childcare can help slow the population decline and immigration of young, skilled workers can help address the labor shortages and increase productivity.\n\nAccording to the latest revision of the United Nation's World Population Prospects, many countries will face these challenges within this century if they do not already, such as the aforementioned Japan and Italy and China and Germany, which were expected to see their first population decline in 2023. France's population is expected to start declining in 2043, Brazil's in 2048 and even India's vast population is projected to start shrinking in 2065. Among developed nations, the United States, Canada and Australia are notable exception, with none of them currently expected to see their first population decline in the 21 century. Geographically, many African nations are still growing rapidly, resulting in a continental shift in global population that will see countries like Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Tanzania among the most populous nations in the world by 2100.", "source": {"uri": "statista.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Statista"}, "authors": [{"uri": "felix_richter@statista.com",

MORE\n\n\"Population growth today is one of the greatest challenges we face. Let's address it with compassion and foresight.\"\n\nIn April 2023, India overtook China to become the most populous country in the world. Moreover, India population is the youngest among the large-area countries of the world. Will the large and young population pay \"demographic dividend\" to India as it did to China? Between 1982 and 2000, in less than twenty years, China's real GDP per capita quadrupled. A record unmatched elsewhere in the world. The \"dividend\" gains in China continued during 2000-2013 though at a slower pace.\n\nIndia's demographic dividend will continue at least till 2055-56. It will peak around 2041, when 59% of its population will be of working-age (20-59 years). At present, India's working-age population is nine hundred million.\n\nA large population has several benefits. But also disadvantages.\n\nBenefits of a large population\n\nA large population can drive economic growth. It has a bigger labor force which increases production and consumption. It creates a substantial domestic market for goods and services, attracting businesses and encouraging investment. It has diverse and abundant human resources which can foster innovation and creativity, leading to technological advancements and new business opportunities.\n\nA larger population offers a broader range of skills and talents, which can enhance the capabilities of industries and organizations. It justifies and supports the development of extensive infrastructure projects, such as transportation networks, utilities, and public services. It leads to urbanization, which can drive improvements in infrastructure and living standards.\n\nA larger population provides a more substantial pool of recruits for military and defence and thus enhances national security. Also, countries with larger population, such as China, the US, Russia, and India have more significant political and economic influence on the global stage.\n\nAdvantages of young population\n\nThe advantages listed above are all the greater if the population is young. The young have more years left to work and tend to have higher purchasing powers as they settle down in life and in their careers. The young are more innovative, more energetic, and more of risk takers and therefore are more likely to set up new companies to benefit from new and emerging technologies.\n\nSome of today's most valuable companies were founded by young people. Apple by Steve Jobs at age 21, META by Mark Zuckerberg at age 20, Microsoft by Bill Gates at age 21, Zip2 by Elon Musk, today's entrepreneurial behemoth, at age 24. Actually, the most successful companies are set up by 45 year olds.\n\nIndia has the youngest population among large-area countries. Population median age India 29.5, Northern America (US and Canada) 38.6, China 39.8, Europe 42.5, Russia 49.5. India has 616.2 million persons of Ages 0-24, highest in the world. India has 50% more young people than China, which has the second highest number in the world.\n\nIndia's young population is dynamic: it grew up in a market economy with access to the Internet and a hunger to compete on the global stage. Two-thirds of the Indian population has access to smartphones, and cheap data plans. US-based Indian economist Shruti Rajagopalan writes, \"This generation of young Indians will be the largest consumer and labor source in the knowledge and network goods economy.\"\n\nDisadvantages of a large population\n\nThe population that a country's resources such as arable land, water, and raw materials can sustain is termed optimum population. Overpopulatiion depletes natural resources, degrades environment, causes overcrowding, unemployment, income inequality and poverty, unmet demands for healthcare and education, deforestation, adverse climate-change, and food insecurity. These create political and social tensions and law and order problems. All of these are aggravated if the country has high population density (number of people in one square kilometer of area). The problems created by overpopulation and high population density are already visible in India.\n\nOverpopulation in India\n\nOptimum population for India is 900-1,200 million. But India's population is already over 1,400 million. It will increase further and peak at 1,700 million by 2064. Moreover, India's population density is the highest among the ten largest countries in the world by area. India population density is 435 compared to USA 37, Russia 8.5, Canada 4. and Australia 3. As India's population increases, so will its population density. So, the problems created by overpopulation and high population density will continue to increase over the next forty years. Let us look at three of the several upheavals that India faces, water scarcity, food security and unemployment.\n\nWater scarcity\n\nBengaluru, Pune, Delhi, Indore, Thane, Vadodara, Chenai, and several other cities are already facing acute water scarcity. Delhi NCR, Chenai Metropolitan area, and several other cities are at the verge of exhausting their groundwater resources. Six hundred million people in India, which is 42% of its population, are already water deprived. To say that water famine, intense water scarcity, looms will not be a hyperbole.\n\nFood security\n\nIndia's cultivated land area is already 50.4% of its total land, the highest in the world. In comparison, in the US it is 17.1%, China 15.4%, Russia 7.4%. Over the next few decades, India will face severe food security challenge. It will have to import food to feed its hungry masses. This will put India's economy under stress.\n\nUnemployment\n\nThe working-age (20-59 years) population of India is nine hundred million. That can be a great asset if it is productively employed. But Less than 50% of working-age Indians are employed. For women it is even worse. Only 20% of working-age women are employed in the formal labour market. India's unemployment rate is a high of 7-8%. To absorb the young working population, India needs to create at least ninety million new non-farming jobs by 2030. That is a tall order.\n\nThe silver lining for India is that skilled population across Europe and America is decreasing, causing a shortage of skilled manpower. That makes India's population an asset that's \"politically important and indispensable,\" says Dr S Y Quraishi ex Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) of India in his well-researched book. He says, \"Other countries may be hating India, but they love our market.\" About the Indians he says, \"They are the CEOs of the world, and the source of an economic revolution that gives back 90 billion dollars in remittances from abroad.\"\n\nConclusion\n\nOverpopulation and high population density pose immense challenges to India. But India's population is young. If it is upskilled and productively employed, it can deliver \"demographic dividend\" over the next few decades. To leverage the \"dividend,\" India must put the young at the canter of its policies; must invest in their education, skill development, and employment generation; and must invest in women's emancipation and employment.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sadhana_kala@timesofindia.indiatimes.com",

In Asia and the Pacific, we convened the Seventh Asian and Pacific Population Conference in 2023 which informed the ICPD commemoration earlier this year.\n\nThese events help us to reflect on how the concept of population policies has evolved from a narrow focus on population control to identifying and seeking opportunities in the multiple linkages between population and development.\n\nThe region has changed beyond recognition from the situation in 1963 when the first Asian and Pacific Population Conference was convened, and population policies were first given serious attention.\n\nThe population of the region at that time was 1.9 billion, with a total fertility rate of about 6.0 births per woman and a life expectancy at birth of 51.3 years. Children aged 0-14 accounted for 40 per cent of the total population, whereas persons 65 years or older accounted for about 4 per cent.\n\nToday, the region has a population of about 4.8 billion people which represents about 58 per cent of the world's total. The total fertility rate has plunged to 1.8 births per woman, life expectancy at birth has increased to 74.7 years, and the proportion of older persons stands at 10.5 per cent of the total population (and it is projected to go up to 19 per cent or almost 1 billion people by 2050).\n\nThese aggregates mark variation at the subregional levels, with older persons in countries in East and North-East Asia, for example, already accounting for a much greater share of the total population compared to countries in other parts of the region.\n\nThis has significant implications for the labour force, economy, health care and sustainability of social protection systems. The issue has been highlighted by ESCAP and the UN system for years, and it is now receiving heightened attention from Governments, civil society and mainstream media, some of whom are making doomsday predictions resulting in negative perceptions of older persons and outright ageism.\n\nSome governments have initiated pro-natalist policies with limited effect. The demographic changes that have happened over decades cannot be reversed by the flick of a switch.\n\nWe need to understand that population ageing is the result of significant progress and achievements in health care, nutrition, education, strives toward gender equality and empowerment of women and greater reproductive choices for women.\n\nPopulation ageing can be seen as a natural outcome of these achievements, but clearly, we need to adapt better to these changes that affect all aspects of society. We need a range of interconnected policies which ensure stronger social protection systems, promote active and healthy ageing, and build strong care systems. We need to support older women who are often the most likely to be left behind.\n\nAlso, the younger people of today are older persons of tomorrow, and thus we must adopt a life course approach to population ageing that recognizes the importance of data and evidence and accords priority to the rights of older persons.\n\nAs proportions of older persons rise, significant cohorts of populations in different age groups will co-exist in our region for the first time in history. This means that managing inter-generational relations will be critical to ensuring harmonious, cohesive, inclusive and sustainable societies in the future.\n\nEnsuring gender equality is critical to addressing this issue. Relieving women, including many older women, of the huge unpaid care burden and ensuring their participation in the labour force will contribute to maintaining labour force productivity keeping them active and healthy for longer periods. This will add trillions of USD to the GDP of countries in the region.\n\nThis can only be achieved if population policies are reimagined to explore their multiple links to the different dimensions of development, taking into account the changing age and family structures.\n\nIn the end, it is as important to add life to years as it is to add years to life.", "source": {"uri": "ipsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "IPS Inter Press Service - Global News Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Total fertility rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Population_and_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Conference on Population and Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_and_Social_Commission_for_Asia_and_the_Pacific", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainstream media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ageism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Population ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Press_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Press Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cohort (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2024/07/Grandparents-looking_-280x150.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 63, "textEnd": 70}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 19, "textEnd": 25}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

In 1989, the United Nations Development Programme identified the necessity for a more focused approach to population issues and established the annual celebration of the date. The occasion serves as a platform to highlight the critical challenges associated with global population trends and their impact on sustainable development, health, and gender.\n\nThe current global population has crossed the 7.9 billion mark.\n\nSri Lanka faces major changes in its population dynamics with an increasingly ageing population and a decreasing birth rate.\n\nThe Census and Statistics Department also reports a notable decrease in the population in 2023, giving reasons for migration patterns, a decline in birth rates and increased mortality rates. The average annual population in 2023 decreased by 144,395 with comparison to 2022, given the drop in births, increase in deaths and rise in the numbers leaving the country.\n\nProfessor Lakshman Dissanayake of the University of Colombo believes the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted Sri Lanka's population dynamics and its falling birth rates. This was due to the disruptions with delayed marriages and familyplanning decisions which were influenced by economic and health concerns in the country.\n\nAnother reason is the overall economic fluctuations of the country resulting in higher food and commodity pricing. According to the CSD, another 75% of households in the past year have limited their spending and cut down their household expenditure to cope with the effects of the economic crisis. Birth rates may have been impacted in this case as children are an economic burden for parents without sufficient savings and, with fluctuating prices of the vast medical and personal needs required for a new parent and baby, bringing a child into this world is not an easy option for couples.\n\nAnother population demographic issue Sri Lanka faces was in just 15 years more than one in four or 25% of Sri Lankans will be over 60. An ageing population puts a strain on the workforce as the number of workers retiring will increase, placing an increasing burden on the public sector pension scheme. An ageing population puts a burden on the healthcare system. Life expectancy, which currently stands at 77 years in Sri Lanka, requires the elderly to seek increasingly specialised treatment and comprehensive care. A growing ageing population necessitates the expansion and availability of eldercare facilities across the country. Given the limited number of existing facilities, improving the quality and availability of these services will be essential to cope with the demands of an ageing population. Vulnerable groups who are not eligible for a pension may also look to find informal work due to their lack of income in retirement.\n\nFor economic progressions of growth, the heavy burden of the ageing population and declining birth rates stunt economic growth in a country. It may lead to a shrinking workforce, which reduces productivity, results in labour shortages and leads to skill gaps in the labour sector.\n\nSome suggestions economists have given countries facing similar demographic struggles include providing pro-natal policies such as policies which ease the financial and social burden of having a child on the parents. Flexible work arrangements, affordable and quality childcare and adequate amounts of maternity and paternity leave are crucial factors encouraging the increase of the declining birth rate.\n\nAnother suggestion is accelerating the progress of the empowerment of women and girls which could help reduce the burden of fluctuating fertility rates and changing population sizes. The government must ensure girls' education is protected and increasing the access to information and services related to their sexual and reproductive health and rights could address population change and build resilient societies. Suggestions include the promotion of workplace policies which support families who want to expand their families with flexible working hours and remote work options. Ensuring girls' education is particularly important as it allows encourages women to balance career and familial responsibilities.\n\nExperiences around the world from countries facing similar issues have shown that specific incentives and disincentives have only had a marginal impact on fertility rates. Taking into consideration social norms, climate change and economic challenges is crucial to creating a rational framework to attempt to move fertility rates in a direction.", "source": {"uri": "groundviews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Groundviews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Population ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Population dynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Development Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colombo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Colombo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remote work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rationality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://groundviews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/old-copy.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 167, "textEnd": 174}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The theme for this year is \"Leave no one behind, count everyone\".\n\nWith about 142.86 crore population, India overtook China to become the world's most populous nation, according to the UNFPA's State of the World Population Report in 2023.\n\nSpeaking to IANS, Poonam Muttreja, Executive Director of the Population Foundation Of India (PFI), said even though India became the world's most populous nation, \"we have attained the replacement-level fertility rate.\"\n\n\"This means that the average number of children born per woman is sufficient to keep the population size stable from one generation to the next,\" she explained.\n\nYet, due to a large proportion of young people, the population in India will continue to grow.\n\n\"Nonetheless, we have made remarkable progress towards population stabilisation,\" Poonam said.\n\nHowever, she called for a shift in focus -- on reaching the unreached, that is, the women, young people, and marginalised communities.\n\n\"The reproductive rights, access to resources, and health and well-being outcomes of these groups remain inadequate,\" Poonam said.\n\nThere are approximately 24 million women with an unmet need for family planning, meaning they want to stop or delay childbearing but lack the access or agency to use contraception.\n\n\"The upcoming budget must increase the investment in family planning, especially in long-lasting modern contraceptives, as addressing these needs is crucial for achieving equitable and sustainable development,\" the PFI chief said.\n\nThis was also advocated by the Union Health Minister J. P. Nadda, who called for \"healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy for the health and well-being of mother and child.\"\n\nPopulation increases also create congestion and deplete human health resources.\n\n\"It also adds load to our already overburdened infrastructure, deprives people of basic amenities, causes scarcity of water, problems related to hygiene and sewage,\" M Wali, Senior Consultant, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, told IANS.\n\nOverpopulation can also worsen health care indices like morbidity and mortality as preventive and screening health care needs of the population (especially the vulnerable sections like women, children, and elderly) are not adequately met.\n\n\"Uplifting women is an efficient strategy to keep the overpopulation problem in check. Educated women are more likely to exercise their reproductive rights, that is, use contraception and motivate their partners for the same, plan families, and consider termination of undesired pregnancies.

With growth comes along the challenges. India's population boom can be attributed to several factors. One is the success of public health initiatives that have led to a significant decline in mortality rates. While the average birth rate has decreased, it has not fallen fast enough to offset the drop in deaths.\n\nAnother factor is the prevalence of early marriage, particularly in rural areas. Young couples tend to have more children, further accelerating population growth. Lack of education, especially among women, limits awareness about family planning methods and their benefits. On the wake of World Population Day 2024, let us understand the socio-economic, cultural and scientific causes and impact of overpopulation in India.\n\nAs India stands strong with an estimated population of 1.44 billion, the numbers are very concerning. The impact of overpopulation in India is multifaceted. The primary concern lies in the strain it places on essential resources. Feeding a burgeoning population requires a vast amount of food production, placing pressure on already strained agricultural land. Water scarcity is another growing concern, as competition for this vital resource intensifies.\n\nEconomic and Social Ramifications\n\nPopulation Blast creates significant burden on the Indian economy. Job creation struggles to keep pace with the expanding workforce, leading to unemployment and underemployment. This, in turn, contributes to poverty and limits social mobility. Basic amenities like education and healthcare become stretched thin, obstructing the development pace.\n\nEnvironmental Degradation\n\nIt has been predicted that India's population will surpass 1.5 billion by 2030. The environmental consequences of this population growth is equally worrisome. As the population grows, so does the demand for housing, infrastructure, and industrial activity. This leads to deforestation, soil erosion, and pollution, jeopardizing the delicate balance of India's ecosystems.\n\nIndia's demographic future demands a multi-pronged approach. Continued investment in education, particularly for women, is crucial. Promoting family planning initiatives and raising awareness about their benefits is equally important. Investing in sustainable agricultural practices and renewable energy sources can help mitigate the strain on resources.\n\nWorld Population Day serves as a stark reminder of the challenges India faces due to overpopulation. By employing integrated measures, India can work towards a future where its large population becomes a source of strength and not a burden. Equitable growth ensured by holistic inclusive methods can be an absolute game-changer. A demography such as India's has to be backed by equitable growth plans, sustainable economic development and socio-economic solidarity.", "source": {"uri": "krishijagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "krishijagran.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human overpopulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rural area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water scarcity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Underemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social mobility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_erosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soil erosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://kj1bcdn.b-cdn.net/media/99123/population-streak.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

It was in 1989 that the United Nations established the day after Dr. K.C. Zachariah, a renowned demographer, had proposed the concept of a 'World Population Day'. The world population had touched five billion in 1987 and challenges such as poverty, health and gender inequality were plaguing the world, developing countries in particular.\n\nThe decades of the 1960s and 1970s were scary as the global population was growing at a yearly rate of 2%. For India, there was a prediction of doom. This meant that widespread poverty, hunger and deaths were soon to follow in the next decades. However, despite the predictions, the next decades told a different story altogether. Global fertility rates declined rapidly. Due to improvements in living conditions and medical infrastructure, life expectancy increased. In India too, fertility rates began to fall since the 1970s and at present is below the replacement level. India's progress in many health parameters has been outstanding. There have been significant reductions in maternal and child mortality.\n\nIn 2015, the UN adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which were soon recognised as important metrics in assessing the progress of nations. With 2030, the target year, drawing closer, India's progress in the SDGs should be understood particularly in light of its population dynamics.\n\nIndia's population dynamics\n\nThree components, namely fertility, mortality, and migration, play a pivotal role in shaping India's demographic landscape. India has made significant strides in reducing its fertility. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5, India's total fertility rate (TFR) decreased from 3.4 to 2 between 1992 and 2021, dropping below the replacement level of 2.1. There has been a significant drop in the mortality rate as well. The average life expectancy of Indians has also increased over time. With this, India is experiencing a demographic shift, towards an ageing population. According to the 2011 Census, individuals aged 60 years and above constituted 8.6% of the total population. The figure is projected to rise up to 19.5% by 2050. But what really do these changing dynamics signify?\n\nIndia's population dynamics is intertwined with its 'development' scenario. The reduction in fertility signifies a transition toward smaller family norms. This can reduce the proportion of the dependent population and result in a demographic dividend -- a period where the working-age population is larger than the dependent population. India can harness the potential of its young workforce by creating employment. The decline in mortality and increase in life expectancy are reflections of a robust health-care system and increased living standards. The issue of population ageing, however, requires a long-term plan -- focusing on geriatric care and providing social security benefits. Migration and urbanisation are also critical issues. Rapid rural to urban migration is posing a threat to the existing urban infrastructure. Among all these, gender equality also finds an important place. Women labour force participation, which is straggling, their notable absence from political representation and their unending plight within society are the silent issues which can sabotage India's path to 2030.\n\nWith six years in hand to meet the targets, India's road to 2030 crosses the path with its population dynamics. Population issues such as gender equality and socio-cultural divides cannot be ignored in the journey to achieve SDGs. It is only with a thorough understanding that India will be able to achieve a 'development' which is sustainable in its truest sense.\n\nThe country's SDG journey\n\n'Development' in the simplest way means ensuring the basic requirements of food, shelter and health for all. 'No Poverty, Zero Hunger and Good Health' are the three most important SDGs which form the core of 'development'. India's journey from the brink of a demographic disaster to striving towards the 2030 goal of 'leaving no one behind' has seen a couple of hits and misses.\n\nIndia made great leaps towards the goal of eradicating poverty. The proportion of the population living below the poverty line reduced from 48% to 10% between 1990 and 2019. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) that came into effect in 2006 played a critical role in addressing rural poverty. The Janani Suraksha Yojana of 2005 -- it provides cash benefits to pregnant women -- not only accentuated institutional deliveries but also saved poor families from hefty health expenditures.\n\nIn his controversial book, The Population Bomb (1968), Paul R. Ehrlich raised serious questions about India's ability to feed its population in the years to come. With the Green Revolution, India became self-sufficient in crop production and averted a catastrophe. The proportion of the population suffering from hunger reduced from 18.3% in 2001 to 16.6% in 2021. However, India's nutrition picture is not completely rosy. India contributes a third of the global burden of malnutrition. Though the Indian government launched the Prime Minister's Overarching Scheme for. Holistic Nourishment (POSHAN) Abhiyaan in 2018, it will still require a miracle to fulfil the target of 'Zero Hunger' by 2030.\n\nHealth is one sector in India where progress made has been remarkable. All the critical mortality indicators have seen steady declines. The Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) decreased from 384.4 in 2000 to 102.7 in 2020. The mortality rate for children under five reduced significantly post 2000s. The infant mortality rate also reduced from 66.7 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 25.5 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2021. Although India is still not near reaching the targets, it seems to be on the right track. These achievements show that there has been a significant improvement in the quality and coverage of health care.\n\nDespite these achievements, India's road towards 2030 is not easy. According to Oxfam, the top 10% of India's population holds 77% of the national wealth. If the fruits of development are not equitably distributed and if development does not percolate to the poorest of the poor and the wealth scenario remains so skewed as it is now, 'sustainable development' can never be achieved in its truest sense. Absolute growth in GDP numbers has limited importance for a country where the top 1% holds 40% of the total wealth. Hunger and nutrition is another sector in crisis. In the Global Hunger Index (2023), India's rank was 111 out of 125 countries. In terms of nutrition, stunting, wasting and underweight among children below five years and anaemia among women pose serious challenges. India's epidemiological trajectory shows that the country has a double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases (NCD). This is a serious challenge for India which also combats the early onset of NCDs and the rising health needs of the elderly.\n\nWhat needs looking into\n\nFor India to achieve the SDGs, the changing population dynamics has to be acknowledged while forming policies. India needs to address income inequality, harness its demographic dividend by creating job opportunities for the youth of India and address changing health needs. NCDs, which incur high out-of-pocket expenditures, are catastrophic for some families. India needs a stronger safety net to save these families from slipping into utter poverty. The nutrition scenario should be set right by strengthening programmes. This will require an increase in budgetary allocation for the health and nutrition sectors. Another, but often missed, paradigm of this entire development discussion is gender equality. A gender equal approach and empowerment of vulnerable women can solve most issues and propel India's progress in the SDGs.\n\nIndia still has a long journey to cover in order to meet all the targets of the SDGs. This will require multi-sectoral collaboration and political will. India's progress in SDGs is directly proportional to the well-being of its population and the route to progress lies in a better understanding of its population dynamics and addressing the issues.\n\nParamita Majumdar is a doctoral fellow in population studies at the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai.

In Asia and the Pacific, we convened the Seventh Asian and Pacific Population Conference in 2023 which informed the ICPD commemoration earlier this year.\n\nThese events help us to reflect on how the concept of population policies has evolved from a narrow focus on population control to identifying and seeking opportunities in the multiple linkages between population and development.\n\nThe region has changed beyond recognition from the situation in 1963 when the first Asian and Pacific Population Conference was convened, and population policies were first given serious attention.\n\nThe population of the region at that time was 1.9 billion, with a total fertility rate of about 6.0 births per woman and a life expectancy at birth of 51.3 years. Children aged 0-14 accounted for 40 per cent of the total population, whereas persons 65 years or older accounted for about 4 per cent.\n\nToday, the region has a population of about 4.8 billion people which represents about 58 per cent of the world's total. The total fertility rate has plunged to 1.8 births per woman, life expectancy at birth has increased to 74.7 years, and the proportion of older persons stands at 10.5 per cent of the total population (and it is projected to go up to 19 per cent or almost 1 billion people by 2050).\n\nThese aggregates mark variation at the subregional levels, with older persons in countries in East and North-East Asia, for example, already accounting for a much greater share of the total population compared to countries in other parts of the region.\n\nThis has significant implications for the labour force, economy, health care and sustainability of social protection systems. The issue has been highlighted by ESCAP and the UN system for years, and it is now receiving heightened attention from Governments, civil society and mainstream media, some of whom are making doomsday predictions resulting in negative perceptions of older persons and outright ageism.\n\nSome governments have initiated pro-natalist policies with limited effect. The demographic changes that have happened over decades cannot be reversed by the flick of a switch.\n\nWe need to understand that population ageing is the result of significant progress and achievements in health care, nutrition, education, strives toward gender equality and empowerment of women and greater reproductive choices for women.\n\nPopulation ageing can be seen as a natural outcome of these achievements, but clearly, we need to adapt better to these changes that affect all aspects of society. We need a range of interconnected policies which ensure stronger social protection systems, promote active and healthy ageing, and build strong care systems. We need to support older women who are often the most likely to be left behind.\n\nAlso, the younger people of today are older persons of tomorrow, and thus we must adopt a life course approach to population ageing that recognizes the importance of data and evidence and accords priority to the rights of older persons.\n\nAs proportions of older persons rise, significant cohorts of populations in different age groups will co-exist in our region for the first time in history. This means that managing inter-generational relations will be critical to ensuring harmonious, cohesive, inclusive and sustainable societies in the future.\n\nEnsuring gender equality is critical to addressing this issue. Relieving women, including many older women, of the huge unpaid care burden and ensuring their participation in the labour force will contribute to maintaining labour force productivity keeping them active and healthy for longer periods. This will add trillions of USD to the GDP of countries in the region.\n\nThis can only be achieved if population policies are reimagined to explore their multiple links to the different dimensions of development, taking into account the changing age and family structures.\n\nIn the end, it is as important to add life to years as it is to add years to life.", "source": {"uri": "globalissues.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global Issues"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Total fertility rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Population_and_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Conference on Population and Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ageism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Population ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_course_approach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life course approach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cohort (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://static.globalissues.org/globalissues.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

The theme for this year is \"Leave no one behind, count everyone\".\n\nWith about 142.86 crore population, India overtook China to become the world's most populous nation, according to the UNFPA's State of the World Population Report in 2023.\n\nSpeaking to VOICE, Poonam Muttreja, Executive Director of the Population Foundation Of India (PFI), said even though India became the world's most populous nation, \"we have attained the replacement-level fertility rate.\"\n\n\"This means that the average number of children born per woman is sufficient to keep the population size stable from one generation to the next,\" she explained.\n\nYet, due to a large proportion of young people, the population in India will continue to grow.\n\n\"Nonetheless, we have made remarkable progress towards population stabilisation,\" Poonam said.\n\nHowever, she called for a shift in focus -- on reaching the unreached, that is, the women, young people, and marginalised communities.\n\n\"The reproductive rights, access to resources, and health and well-being outcomes of these groups remain inadequate,\" Poonam said.\n\nThere are approximately 24 million women with an unmet need for family planning, meaning they want to stop or delay childbearing but lack the access or agency to use contraception.\n\n\"The upcoming budget must increase the investment in family planning, especially in long-lasting modern contraceptives, as addressing these needs is crucial for achieving equitable and sustainable development,\" the PFI chief said.\n\nThis was also advocated by the Union Health Minister J. P. Nadda, who called for \"healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy for the health and well-being of mother and child.\"\n\nPopulation increases also create congestion and deplete human health resources.\n\n\"It also adds load to our already overburdened infrastructure, deprives people of basic amenities, causes scarcity of water, problems related to hygiene and sewage,\" M Wali, Senior Consultant, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, told VOICE.\n\nOverpopulation can also worsen health care indices like morbidity and mortality as preventive and screening health care needs of the population (especially the vulnerable sections like women, children, and elderly) are not adequately met.\n\n\"Uplifting women is an efficient strategy to keep the overpopulation problem in check. Educated women are more likely to exercise their reproductive rights, that is, use contraception and motivate their partners for the same, plan families, and consider termination of undesired pregnancies. They are also more likely to understand the importance of having small and healthy families,\" Isha Wadhawan, from Fortis Faridabad, told VOICE.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Total fertility rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Bangladesh is a member of the young one.\n\nAccording to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) data for 2022, 75.3% of Bangladesh's population is 41 years or less.\n\nWith this vast majority of the population being youthful, the country's destiny somewhat lies in their hands. However, this blessed period of opportunity, referred to as demographic dividend, will not last forever. According to UNDP, it will continue till 2040.\n\nThe proportion of working-age people declined to 65.08% in 2023 from 66.58% in 2021, according to a BBS survey -- representing a decline in the working population.\n\nThis can be understood as a population crisis - a young and underutilised population does not inspire much hope for the future. So what are the solutions?\n\nWe looked at some of the population trends from around the world which share similarities with our demography and challenges; and spoke to experts to understand what needs to be done to reap the benefits of a \"young\" population against an \"ageing\" population in some parts of the world.\n\nSize matters\n\nThe population crisis varies across countries worldwide. In some regions, the problem is low fertility rates and an ageing population, while in others, it is overpopulation. For instance, the headline \"North Korea's Kim Jong Un urges women to have more children\" from last year highlights the severity of the fertility rate crisis there. Countries like South Korea, Japan and Italy face low fertility rate issues.\n\nHowever, Bangladesh has succeeded in birth control and become a role model to the world. The total fertility rate (TFR) was over six after independence but sharply fell to 2.15 in 2022. According to a World Bank report, the yearly population growth rate of Bangladesh was 3% during the 1970s, which reduced to 1.22% in 2022, as per the sixth census of Bangladesh.\n\nDoes this mean our population crisis is on the way to being resolved? The answer is no. It extends far beyond just controlling numbers.\n\nBangladesh's population problem lies in terms of overpopulation which is similar to China, India and the United States. However, its youth bulge challenge aligns with that of India and some African nations.\n\n\"India is making a big mistake believing the 'hype' around its strong economic growth since there are significant structural problems that need to be fixed for the country to meet its potential,\" Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, told Bloomberg in March this year.\n\nThe statement applies to Bangladesh too. Despite massive infrastructure-based economic growth, we are missing out on human development.\n\nThe missing link: Human development\n\nA large youth population can drive economic growth if they are well-integrated into the labour market. But it requires significant job creation, education and training programmes to avoid high levels of youth NEET (not in employment, education or training).\n\nHowever, the youth bulge or demographic dividend is sometimes over-glorified. A large working-age population is not necessarily an asset for the country unless they are skilled and employed. For Bangladesh, it is a challenge instead.\n\nIn his book titled \"The World in 2050: How to Think about the Future,\" author Hamish McRae argues that India's relative youth is also its 'challenge' which applies to Bangladesh and Pakistan.\n\n\"How do you ensure that young people are adequately prepared for a world that requires people to be better educated and better trained -- not just for the roles that exist now, but for those that have yet to be created?\" McRae wrote.\n\nUnfortunately, 41% of Bangladeshi youth, totalling about 12.9 million individuals, fall into the NEET category. And the situation for young females is even worse, with 62% being inactive.\n\nDr Zahid Hussain, former lead economist at the World Bank's Dhaka office, pointed out that the education system is failing to prepare young people for the job market. \"Many graduates can't find jobs because their skills don't match what employers need. This has created a paradoxical problem,\" he said.\n\nAnother factor to consider is \"brain drain.\" According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS), in 2021, around 45,000 Bangladeshi students went abroad for higher education. With so many people opting to leave the country, it contributes to the unemployment rate ie the departure of skilled or qualified Bangladeshis creates a vacuum in the country.\n\nBangladesh can follow Africa in utilising the youth. However, unlike Africa, we have a tight deadline ie we will enjoy the demographic dividend till 2040.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that one-third of the world's population -- and the working-age population -- will be African by 2075. It is the only region where the workforce will grow continuously in the coming decades. This is not lost to some of the leaders in the continent.\n\nLast year, Africa's Heads of State gathered to discuss how to accelerate human capital accumulation, leverage the youth bulge and create jobs to propel economic growth. African youths are increasingly taking an active role in shaping their future.\n\nIn cities like Accra, Nairobi, Cairo and Benguerir, thriving start-up ecosystems are revolutionising African agriculture, industry, IT and sustainability.\n\nThe two backbones: Health and education\n\nTimely investments in the education and health sectors can increase productivity. But sadly, these two sectors receive low allocations in the national budget. The global standard suggests a 4-6% allocation for education as a percentage of GDP.\n\nIn our new FY2024-25 budget, it is just about 2%. Although the health budget has increased by 8.8%, it actually decreases when adjusted for inflation. For the past decade, the health sector budget has stayed around 5% of the national budget, which is far below the international standard of 15%.\n\n\"To reap the benefits, we have to invest in health. If you take a look at our budgetary allocation, you will see we invest very little in health; one of the lowest in South Asia. It is the same situation when it comes to education. Our policymakers need to invest more in these two sectors,\" Dr Mohammad Mainul Islam, Professor and Former Chairman of the Department of Population Sciences, University of Dhaka told The Business Standard.\n\nIn this era of digital revolution, the youth have unparalleled access to information and technology. The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) data shows a consecutive surge in the number of internet users in the country -- reaching 131 million at the end of December 2023, including nearly 7 million new users in the last year.\n\nHowever, the digital divide remains a significant issue separating our population. Rural communities are lagging significantly behind. Only 29.7% of households in rural areas have internet access at home, compared to 63.4% in urban areas.\n\nSkilled workers can become our asset\n\nIn April 2019, Japan established a new status of residence, \"Specified Skilled Worker (SSW)\", to welcome specialists from other countries to work in certain Japanese industrial fields. This was done to counter the declining working-age population in Japan.\n\nIt is not just Japan. Finland, Italy, the United Kingdom and even the United States are some of the developed countries who seek skilled migrants to fill the gap left by their ageing population.\n\n\"Some 75% of employers in 21 European countries could not find workers equipped with the right skills in 2023,\" reported Euro News. With the high demand for skilled workers in developed and ageing countries like those in Europe, we have the opportunity to send our labour force to these countries and gain even greater benefits.\n\nThis 'gap' in the developed world, which is experiencing an ageing population, opens a new avenue for our youth -- if aptly skilled, they can fill this gap.\n\nThe Bangladesh government aims to become a high-middle-income country by 2031, which seems nearly impossible at this point. However, for rapid development, Bangladesh can follow in the footsteps of Singapore and South Korea.\n\nSouth Korea's transformation from an underdeveloped nation to a developed, high-income country within a few generations is often regarded as miraculous. Key to its success were export-oriented policies, improvements in the business environment and policies that incentivized investment in innovation.\n\nBy addressing the challenges, we can extend the benefits of our youthful population beyond our borders. Remittances play a crucial role in driving Bangladesh's economic growth and development, but they are predominantly labour-based.\n\nConsidering all these issues at play, Bangladesh seems to be on a tightrope -- it needs to take effective actions to utilise its demographic dividend before time runs out.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Standard"},

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) initiated the day in 1989 after the world reached the five-billion population mark on July 11, 1987. It was officially observed for the first time on July 11, 1990, in over 90 countries after the United Nations General Assembly declared World Population Day in December 1990. Every year, there is a different theme on which the day is observed, and this year, it is \"To Leave No One Behind, Count Everyone\".\n\nThe theme for this year is \"To Leave No One Behind, Count Everyone\". According to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the theme reminds us that \"investing in data collection is important to understanding problems, tailoring solutions, and driving progress. So is finance. I urge countries to make the most of the Summit of the Future this year to unleash affordable capital for sustainable development.\"\n\nWhat does the theme signify?\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), over the past 30 years, the world has witnessed remarkable strides in collecting, analysing, and utilising population data worldwide. These new figures accurately portray our diverse societies, now segmented by age, ethnicity, gender, and other crucial factors.\n\nThese advancements, largely propelled by technology, have significantly enhanced global healthcare delivery, particularly in sexual and reproductive health, and the ability to exercise rights and choices. Technological progress has enabled more detailed and timely measurement of people's experiences and is crucial for better representing marginalised communities in our data systems.\n\nData is urgently needed to represent marginalised communities better. Their lack of representation significantly impacts their well-being, underscoring the need for our collective empathy and support.\n\nWorld Population Day is not just a date on the calendar but also a crucial opportunity to reflect on who still needs to be counted and why. Leaving anyone behind is not an option. It's a chance to understand the costs for individuals, societies, and global efforts. Most importantly, it is a call to action for all to commit to ensuring that our data systems capture the full spectrum of human diversity. This is how one can ensure everyone is seen, exercise their human rights, and reach their full potential.\n\nThe UN says that one must count those on the edges of our societies to realise their rights and choices because everyone counts. Our rich human diversity is only as strong as its weakest link. When data and other systems work for those on the margins, they work for everyone, and this is how one can accelerate progress for all.\n\nThe day aims to draw attention to the urgency and importance of various population issues and highlight the need for global collaboration to address these issues for a sustainable future. Common population-related concerns include gender inequality, poverty, education, and healthcare. Family planning and health-related initiatives are recommended for a sustainable future.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "devika_kapoor@news9live.com", "name": "Devika Kapoor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Development Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/world-population-day-2024-theme.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 50, "textEnd": 57}, {"amb": false, "date": "1990-07-11", "textStart": 398, "textEnd": 411}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 334, "textEnd": 341}, {"amb": false, "date": "1990-12-", "textStart": 509, "textEnd": 522}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

The infrastructural deficit, exacerbated by this population surge, is increasingly evident across various sectors, including transportation, housing, healthcare, and roads, among others. The demand for essential services and amenities is rising sharply, putting significant strain on the existing infrastructure.\n\nOverall, Nigeria's infrastructure struggles are intensifying as the population continues to grow, highlighting the urgent need for governments to address this problem by providing sustainable solutions to address these challenges and ensure a better quality of life for all citizens.\n\nAccording to the United Nations World Population Prospects report, the current world population of 7.6 billion is expected to reach 8.6 billion in 2030, 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100.\n\nWith roughly 83 million people being added to the world's population every year, the upward trend in population size is expected to continue, even if fertility levels continue to decline.\n\nHowever, among the 10 largest countries worldwide, Nigeria is growing the most rapidly. Consequently, the population of Nigeria, currently the world's 7th largest, is projected to surpass that of the United States and become the third-largest country in the world shortly before 2050.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2050, it is anticipated that half of the global population growth will be concentrated in nine countries: India, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Tanzania, the United States, Uganda, and Indonesia.\n\nSimilarly, Africa continues to experience high rates of population growth. Between 2017 and 2050, the populations of 26 African countries are projected to expand to at least double their current size.\n\nHowever, the concentration of global population growth in the world's poorest countries poses a significant challenge for governments in achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This agenda aims to eradicate poverty and hunger, enhance health and education systems, achieve gender equality and women's empowerment, reduce inequality and ensure inclusivity so that no one is left behind.\n\nThe current population of Nigeria is 229,234,291 as of Wednesday, July 10, 2024, based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data, equivalent to 2.78 per cent of the total world population.\n\nAccording to the Statista Forecast population report, demographic projections show that the Nigerian population might experience a constant increase in the next few decades. By 2050, it is forecast that the population will grow to over 377 million people.\n\nNigeria is not certain to see a serious financial commitment from the government towards the expansion of its largely inadequate infrastructure in 2024, PwC said in its Nigeria Economic Outlook 2024 report issued recently.\n\n\"The government will also struggle with the maintenance of the few infrastructures that exist as it stakes much hope on other funding sources rather than financing projects from its purse.\n\n\"Infrastructure funding may remain insufficient in 2024,\" PwC noted.\n\nThe allocated infrastructure spending budget for 2024 is N1.32tn, falling short of the World Bank's suggested 70 per cent infrastructure-to-GDP benchmark, which is currently at 30 per cent.\n\nWeighed down by years of stifled growth, public infrastructures in Nigeria are dysfunctional at the best of times as the availability of such facilities lags behind a rapidly growing population, the largest on the continent, causing them to age ahead of their time by overusing these infrastructural facilities.\n\nAccording to the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, the watchdog agency that regulates the government's public-private-partnership programmes, with 213.4 million people, Nigeria owns 195,000 kilometres of road. However, this is low when compared to that of South Africa, which runs a road network of 750,000 kilometres with a population less than one-third of Nigeria's.\n\n\"Limited fiscal space for public investment and difficulty attracting private investments constrain the ability to make essential infrastructure improvements,\" the PWC stated.\n\nIt further highlighted the inadequate provision of ports, power, and roads that is impeding economic progress, leaving large parts of the country without essential services.\n\nExperts said that infrastructural provision guarantees economic growth. Nigeria's governments should, therefore, make infrastructure a top priority.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States of America, the world's biggest economy, has just commenced a $1.25tn 'Decade of Infrastructure' renewal programme. Despite being credited with the world's third-best infrastructure, in 2019, Singapore committed $10bn per year to infrastructure renewal.\n\nExperts claimed that the country needed between $100bn and $150bn annually over the next 30 years to close its infrastructure gap.\n\nDataphyte estimated it at $2.3tn, and Agusto & Co. and the World Bank at $3tn.\n\nNigeria ranked 24th in 2020 out of 54 African countries in the Africa Infrastructure Development Index with 23.26 points; Egypt was second with 88.3 points, and war-torn Libya was third with 82.9 points.\n\nIt noted that it had been long recognised that an adequate supply of infrastructure services is an essential ingredient for productivity and growth in any economy.\n\nMeanwhile, much of the current international debate on ways to spur growth, reduce poverty, and improve the quality of human life in low-income developing countries has been centred on the need to promote large increases in public investments in infrastructure.\n\nAddressing the provision of public infrastructure services in the country to meet the demands of its growing population has become a significant challenge. This is compounded by rising unemployment rates, increasing price levels, and the subsequent surge in insecurity and crime rates. Therefore, it is essential to examine the true nature of the infrastructure needed for the country's growth trajectory. Dataphyte noted that Nigeria's infrastructure deficit is 40 per cent short of the World Bank standard.\n\nAccording to the International Trade Office of the US Department of Commerce, Nigeria's infrastructure deficit, amounting to 30 per cent of its gross domestic product, falls short of the international benchmark of 70 per cent set by the World Bank.\n\nWith Nigeria's population growing at a rate of over 2.5 per cent per year and an expected population of 400 million people by 2050, the US agency worried that the current infrastructure in the country was likely to be overwhelmed.\n\nAlso, the World Bank has projected that Nigeria would need to invest $3tn to reduce its infrastructure deficit. The 2019 Global Competitive Index Report ranked Nigeria 130th out of 141 economies surveyed for quality infrastructure facilities. With a score of 48.33 out of 100 total points, the country still has over a 50 per cent infrastructure deficit.\n\nOver five years (2016-2020), Nigeria saw slight infrastructure progress in transport, power, ICT, and water. Yet, it still lags behind 23 African countries.\n\nInadequate infrastructure hinders sustainable economic growth despite government efforts, hampered by rural-urban migration and population growth. Robust infrastructure is vital for boosting productivity and fostering economic growth.\n\nThe provision of public infrastructure services in the country to meet the demands of the various economic agents in the face of the ever-increasing population of the country has been a major problem in the country.\n\nRecently, the Minister of Works, David Umahi, assured road users that during his tenure he would ensure that the roads are put in proper conditions for all Nigerians. He pledged that Nigerians would witness vigour, diligence, and commitment to road infrastructure development under his watch.\n\nUmahi added that any road constructed under his leadership would stay for more than six years without the need for maintenance.\n\nHowever, experts believe Nigeria must do more to close the infrastructure deficit gaps as the population rises by the day.\n\nExperts proffer solutions\n\nSpeaking with The PUNCH, the Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprises, Muda Yusuf, said the way the government could address the issue of infrastructure deficit was to review the budget priority.\n\nAccording to Yusuf, the government must take the lead, noting that all over the world, the government takes the lead as far as infrastructure investment is concerned, especially as regards economic and social infrastructure.\n\nHe said, \"It is the infrastructure that the country needs to propel economic activities to be able to support productivity and grow the economy, infrastructure is very fundamental. Changing the structure of government priority would help, because, over the years, Nigeria has been spending a lot more on re-current expenditure and infrastructure expenditures.\n\n\"Even when we talk about capital projects, it's not all capital projects that are infrastructure projects.\"\n\nYusuf emphasised the need to separate infrastructure from capital projects, stating that for most of the budget, the infrastructure component was not up to 10 or 15 per cent.\n\nHe appealed to the government to focus a lot more on infrastructure spending, urging it to look at other ways outside the budget to address the deficit.\n\n\"There was a proposal on the table that the Muhammadu Buhari's administration did not sign. It is called the Road Fund Bill to create dedicated funding specifically for road development so that the Federal Government will not be waiting for the budget before they can begin to fund road projects.\n\n\"The government should encourage private-public investment in infrastructure, but they must create an enabling framework for that to happen to reduce the risk of private sector investment in infrastructure. The PPP framework must be very robust and must inspire the confidence of private investors,\" he explained.\n\nHe argued that the government should create a concessionary financing window for the private sector that wants to invest in the development of the country's infrastructure.\n\nHe also noted that fiscal policy support was very important for private sector investment in infrastructure, tax policy support and import duty support.\n\nAlso, a finance expert, Mr Adetuyor Otubanjo, said the government could leverage public-private partnerships to finance, build, and manage infrastructure projects to address the country's infrastructural deficit amid Nigeria's growing population.\n\nHe said, \"These partnerships can harness private sector efficiency, innovation, and capital to address infrastructure needs while mitigating public expenditure to cushion the efforts of the government to provide adequate infrastructure for its growing population in the future. By sharing risks and responsibilities, these partnerships can lead to more sustainable and well-maintained infrastructure.\"\n\nOtubanjo added that successful PPPs require clear regulatory frameworks and strong governance to ensure transparency and accountability in project execution and tackle this major problem.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"},

The law aims to address population challenges at the time, including birth rate and population distribution.\n\nWhen the ordinance came into effect, Vi\u1ec7t Nam had not achieved replacement-level fertility until 2006. Around the same time, gender imbalance at birth became more pronounced.\n\nThe country's population, now stands at over 100 million, entered the 'golden' period in 2007 and the ageing phase in 2011.\n\nThe 'golden' population has created a competitive edge for Vi\u1ec7t Nam in its socio-economic development, alongside better population distribution as well as improved human resource quality, a higher human development index (HDI) and longer average life expectancy.\n\nThe MoH has called for changes to update the Population Ordinance in alignment with the current situation.\n\nThis means taking into account changes in the Party's direction in shifting from family planning to population development, radically addressing issues related to population size, structure, distribution and quality, as well as rights, responsibilities and frameworks for different stakeholders in population management.\n\nIn the impact assessment report on the population law project, which is open for public comments, the MoH said that the replacement-level fertility level is at the lowest in the past 12 years and is expected to continue declining.\n\nVi\u1ec7t Nam's total fertility rate in 2022 was 2.01 children per woman. In 2023, this figure was estimated at 1.96.\n\nThe report also highlights significant fertility rate disparities between groups and regions.\n\nThe tendency to have few children or none at all has been emerging in urban areas, where economic conditions are high. Meanwhile, in several areas with socio-economic challenges, fertility rates remain elevated, reaching 2.5 children in some locations.\n\nTo sustainably maintain the replacement fertility level of 2.1 children per woman nationwide, the MoH proposes parents should have higher autonomy in childbirth.\n\nThe MoH expects that this measure will prevent birth rates from plummeting, resulting in a severely ageing population and its adverse impacts on socio-economic development as well as national security and defence. -- VNS", "source": {"uri": "vietnamnews.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "vietnamnews.vn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Ghana)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health (Ghana)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human Development Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Total fertility rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Population ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Childbirth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Demography_and_Population_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Demography and Population Studies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://image.vietnamnews.vn/uploadvnnews/Article/2024/7/10/361006_4898548866010762_birthrate.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

The population is now estimated to be 8.1 billion, with India as the most populous nation (1.44 billion), which is slightly more than China's.\n\nThis writer wrote the article, \"Myths about Population Growth\", which was published in this daily on World Population Day ('World Population Day' page, July 11, 1997) -- when India crossed the 100 crore mark. The article showed how the doomsday predictions of Malthus, 200 years ago, or that of his present-day followers in the West, that population growth would overtake food production, never came true and never will in the future. The aim of this article is to analyse what has changed in 27 years.\n\nChanges in India\n\nLet us look at some of the major socio-economic changes in India over 27 years.\n\nThe population has grown 44% from 100 crore to 144 crore, but the annual growth rate of the population has fallen sharply -- from nearly 2% to below 1%. This is because the number of births per woman (total fertility rate or TFR) has fallen from 3.4 to 2, just below the \"replacement level\" of 2.1.\n\nThe per capita GDP of Indians grew six times, from $400 to $2,400. The average life span of an Indian has increased from 61 years to 70 years.\n\nIndians living below the multi-dimensional poverty line decreased from 43% to 11%. However, 11% of 144 crore is still a very large number of 16 crore people.\n\nThe 16 crore people below the poverty line are not distributed evenly across the country. Just four States, namely, Uttar Pradesh: (5.4 crore out of 23.6 crore), Bihar (4.2 crore out of 12.7 crore), Madhya Pradesh (2.52 crore out of 8.7 crore) and Jharkhand (1.1 crore out of 4 crore) account for 83% of the national total of people below the poverty line, while accounting for only 34 % of India's total population. How to address this persisting disparity in socio-economic growth and poverty reduction among Indian States is among the top priorities of the central and State governments and beyond the scope of this article.\n\nImpact of climate change\n\nBut a far more serious issue facing the people of India is the adverse effects of climate change which do not recognise national boundaries. This is where the population versus people dichotomy becomes apparent. The debate on historical emissions (advanced by developing countries) versus current emissions (advanced by the developed world) is closely linked to the population versus people divergence. This is because the per capita consumption of both natural resources and manufactured products directly correlates with the per capita income of the people.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries with a per capita income of $40,000 and a total population of 1.39 billion, together produce and consume $55.6 trillion worth of natural resources and manufactured goods. In comparison, India, with a per capita GDP of $2,400 and a population of 1.44 billion, produces and consumes just $3.5 trillion worth of natural resources and manufactured goods. In other words, the OECD countries with a population slightly less than that of India consume nearly 16 times of what the whole of India consumes. This has been the major cause of global warming over the past few decades, resulting in unpredictable weather changes. In turn this has adversely affected the poor in developing nations more severely than people in developed nations with much better housing and civic infrastructure.\n\nWith 11% of its people still below the poverty line, India will continue to accord priority to economic growth over climate change mitigation measures, and rightly so. That responsibility lies majorly with the OECD countries, and now increasingly with China. Successive Indian governments have negotiated hard at global forums on India's right to grow economically to alleviate poverty as early as possible.\n\nGlobal South and growth\n\nThe Narendra Modi government has articulated this even more forcefully by expanding the definition of the Circular Economy framework in the G-20 New Delhi Declaration of September 2023: \"In order to endeavour to decouple our economic growth from environmental degradation and enhance sustainable consumption and production, including primary resource consumption while supporting economic growth, we acknowledge the critical role played by circular economy, extended producer responsibility and resource efficiency in achieving sustainable development\".\n\nThis is an explicit statement of intent to maintain the economic growth of the Global South nations, a term used for all developing nations as a group. India is looked upon by the nations of the Global South in their efforts to maintain economic growth in their respective nations as the first priority, followed by measures to achieve net zero. India has fixed the year 2070 to achieve this, compared to the European Union's target of reaching net zero by 2050. But India would strive for zero poverty within the next decade.\n\nThe next few decades will see developing nations focusing on eradicating persistent poverty among their people rather than responding to population growth doomsday \"experts\" who have so far not been proved right. As Tamil poet C. Subramania Bharati said nearly 100 years ago, \"Thani oruvanukku unavillai enil, inda jagatthinai azhithiduvom (even if one person does not have food to eat, we will destroy the world\") So, it is the welfare of average citizen which matters and not population numbers at the macro level.\n\nS.

It highlights the urgent need to address population-related issues. This day focuses on important topics like healthy pregnancies and family planning. Many organizations, schools, and colleges participate in spreading awareness.\n\nThey teach people about the importance of managing the population in a healthy way. You might get a chance to speak about World Population Day at various events. This is a great opportunity to help others understand why these issues matter and how we can work together for a better future.\n\nToday, we're discussing our plans for World Population Day 2024, celebrated annually on July 11th. This day, initiated by the United Nations, aims to promote family planning rights and raise awareness about population issues.\n\nOur organization has a strong tradition of celebrating this day, and this year, we are expanding our efforts. We will focus on educating people about the health risks of early marriage and unplanned pregnancies, emphasizing the importance of gender equality and women's empowerment.\n\nWe plan to set up health and information camps, especially in rural areas, and organize skits based on Hindu mythology to convey the importance of treating girls with respect and equality. Our culture reveres goddesses, and we want to remind everyone that girls deserve the same reverence.\n\nOverpopulation strains our resources and infrastructure, and addressing it is crucial for a sustainable future. With your commitment, I am confident we can make this year's event a success.\n\nWelcome! Today, we gather to discuss our plans for celebrating World Population Day on July 11th. Our hospital marks this day annually to emphasize the human right to family planning, as initiated by the United Nations. This observance encourages events and activities to make this right a reality worldwide.\n\nWe aim to raise awareness in our community about critical population issues, such as family planning, gender equality, maternal health, poverty, and human rights. World Population Day is celebrated globally through educational sessions, seminars, essay competitions, and various informative displays.\n\nAs a charitable hospital, it is our social responsibility to educate and empower today's youth. We provide detailed knowledge about sexuality, the importance of marrying at a mature age, and preventing unplanned pregnancies. We also strive to eliminate gender stereotypes and inform young women about pregnancy-related health risks if married too young.\n\nOur efforts extend to rural, semi-urban, and urban areas, where we educate people about sexually transmitted diseases like HIV and AIDS. We focus on promoting gender equality and advocating for laws that protect the rights of girls. Education should be accessible to all children, regardless of gender or class.\n\nWe plan to visit villages and remote areas, organizing mobile schools for girls to raise awareness about population control. Our goal is to promote the benefits of having fewer children, ensuring a better upbringing and a higher standard of living for all.\n\nWe invite you to join us in this important cause, helping to make our country more developed and self-reliant.\n\nEach year, the global population increases by 83 million people. While Africa's population is booming, Europe's is on the decline. Globally, people are living longer, with the average life expectancy reaching 67 years in the year 2000.\n\nAs you know, our NGO selects a theme each year to raise awareness about population issues. This year, our theme is gender equality and the protection of the girl child. Since our establishment, we have fought against female foeticide. Girls are equally important as boys, and perhaps even more so because the entire humanity owes its existence to them, helping to strike a social balance in our society.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant reduction in the number of women compared to men. This is due to the increase in crimes against women, such as dowry deaths, female foeticide, rape, forced illiteracy, and gender-based discrimination. To equalize the boy-girl ratio, it is crucial to start saving the girl child.\n\nOur team travels to rural and semi-urban areas to identify cases where women become victims of societal evils. Female trafficking, domestic violence, forced prostitution, and female foeticide pose serious threats to women's safety. We strive to provide assistance to women living in deprived conditions so they can liberate themselves from these inhumane situations.\n\nWe also work to make them aware of various acts implemented by the government, such as the Gender Equality Act, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act of 2005, the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, and more. Lack of education is one of the main reasons behind this ignorance. Women today are earning name and fame and bringing accolades to the nation on par with their male counterparts. Thus, saving a girl child becomes the need of the hour. Each child has the right to education and to be self-reliant. Population control and wise family planning help couples have an ideal number of children so that every child can receive a fair upbringing and education. It is also important for women who wish to avoid pregnancy to use effective and safe contraceptive measures.\n\nWe have taken steps to educate women all over India, especially in rural areas where there is a lack of awareness and support. Some women do not want to discuss these matters out of timidity and hesitation. We have female colleagues who work voluntarily for the development of such women. They travel in groups, establish mobile schools, healthcare centers, and information centers; organize quizzes, debates, and more where women are urged to come out of their houses and participate in this mission.\n\nOur NGO greatly supports women's development, with several industrialists and business tycoons backing us. Our main objective is to make women independent so they can make important life decisions, such as the right marriageable age, childbirth, and education.\n\nWe appeal to every youth to come forward and join this mission to make World Population Day highly successful.", "source": {"uri": "pratidintime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pratidin Time"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hinduism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_overpopulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human overpopulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexually transmitted infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Population control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-selective_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex-selective abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maternal health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AIDS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rural area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life expectancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Disability", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Disability", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/pratidintime%2F2024-07%2F3fcf6565-8ea0-4a4b-8f3e-ea0b9714cdf6%2FWhatsApp%20Image%202024-07-10%20at%205.17.01%20PM%20(4).jpeg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 664, "textEnd": 673, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Its aim is to raise awareness of the world's population challenges and their impacts on development and the environment.\n\nEach year, to coincide with World Population Day, the UN releases the 'World population prospects: summary of results' report that uses demographic data to assess population levels, regional differences in population growth and decline, and global, regional, and national level trends. For resilience professionals, population challenges and their impacts can directly challenge organizations' resilience. Therefore, in being mindful of the results of this - and similar - reports each year, practitioners can review how their own organization, and their suppliers, could be impacted by emerging population trends.\n\nThis demographic data has identified huge leaps in population growth and reflects the world's age, ethnicity, and gender societal structures. However, as the UN recognises, the most marginalised communities remain underrepresented in data, meaning many communities lack a voice and continue to be adversely impacted.\n\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres highlighted the importance of accurate data in order to propose pertinent solutions:\n\n\"As the theme of this year's World Population Day reminds us, investing in data collection is important to understanding problems, tailoring solutions, and driving progress.\"\n\nWorld Population Day is a chance to consider who is underrepresented, the reasons why, and ask how this affects society. It's also a chance to reflect on how organizations capture and promote diversity so everyone can reach their full potential.\n\nThere are many advantages of embedding equality, diversity, and inclusion principles within organizations, such as a larger pool of prospective talent to choose from when hiring, more in-house innovation, a clearer understanding of diverse customer bases, and wider perspectives on organizational challenges, all of which ultimately lead to more profit.\n\nIn business continuity (BC), a diverse range of staff is a valuable asset. An inclusive business continuity team means a range of viewpoints are considered so that gaps in resilience planning are not missed, and it promotes faster, better problem solving and decision making. Therefore, organizations that promote diversity and inclusiveness are likely to be the most resilient, catering for all its stakeholders and approaching adverse challenges from a number of nuanced angles.\n\nBCI member Neal Mullen explains how a group of neurotypical and neurodiverse business continuity practitioners brings more innovation, skill, and creative solutions to the table than a solely neurotypical group could bring.\n\nIn his article 'Patterns' Neal said: \"In the realm of resilience, the unique skills and approaches of neurodiverse staff, particularly in planning and crisis situations, should be viewed as invaluable assets...if you can harness neurodiverse capabilities, and blend them with neurotypical skills, whatever your department or business does, you will excel.\"\n\nThis insightful point underlines the positive aspects of neurodiverse and neurotypical capabilities working together, but it also reflects the better advantages of teams working without heavy biases, for example age, gender, and ethnicity.\n\nUltimately, a diverse organization that weaves inclusivity into the fabric of its structure enhances its reputation and creates a more resilient organization that's capable of weathering disruptions, satisfying stakeholders, and delivering business as usual.", "source": {"uri": "thebci.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "thebci.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Population_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Population Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurodiversity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maternal health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Development Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thebci.org/static/b6aaa290-0320-450a-9513c12cfd7692ba/opengraphimage_83f4e8796336604b59d7216d0ecd81a5_4a7c7e45a350/thumbnail-world-population-day.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717823", "eventUri": "eng-9717823", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 14}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

In the context of Pakistan's population problem, Pakistan is facing the issue of overpopulation and high fertility rate, which needs urgent attention of the Government to resolve.\n\nPakistan has a population of 241.49 million people with a growth/fertility rate of 2.55 percent as reported in the results of 7th Population and Housing Census 2023 by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. Pakistan's population growth/fertility rate in 1998 was 2.69 percent and in 2017 it was 2.4 percent. The current fertility rate (2.55 percent) is significantly higher than the economic growth rate of Pakistan and if current fertility rate continues unchecked, the population of Pakistan will likely touch the figure of 290 million people by 2030. In 2017 population census in Pakistan, the population of Pakistan was estimated at 207 million, which reflects an increase of approx. 35 million people in 2023 census. The increase of 35 million people in just six years is an alarming figure for economically unstable nation, where inflation, unemployment rates are very high.\n\nAccording to Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data, the current population of Pakistan is 245.215 million people, fertility rate is 3.28 percent, fifth most populous country in the world, second largest Muslim population country and its population is equivalent to 2.99 percent of the total world population. These figures are a matter of great concern for a developing nation, which has inadequate resources/infrastructure/prospects/land area/socio-economic status. If the fertility rate is not controlled, the resources/infrastructure of the country will be overburdened and its already weak economy will be deteriorated more.\n\nThe factors contributing to overpopulation in the country inter alia are high birth rate, insufficient reproductive health and family planning services, disowning of modern contraceptive methods, high child/maternal mortality rates, poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, early marriages, social/cultural/religious practices to have many children. A recent research study declared that women in Pakistan have an estimated 3.8 million unintended pregnancies annually, because of ignoring modern contraceptions.\n\nThe consequences of overpopulation inter alia are increased demand for food, water, housing, energy, education, healthcare, and transportation etc., leading to environmental pollution, climate change, malnutrition, unemployment, poverty, substandard education/healthcare facilities, increase in crime rate and sluggish economy.\n\nNations across the world have adopted population control best practices to address the problem of overpopulation for the development of their countries. A good example of such best practice and a success story is that of a Muslim country Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan), which adopted effective strategies for population management in the country. In 1971, the population of Bangladesh was around 70 million, whereas that of Pakistan was approx. 60 million. After passing of 52 years, Bangladesh's population is 174 million, whereas Pakistan's is over 245 million. Policymakers in Bangladesh focused on overpopulation, education and preventive measures by introducing National Family Planning Programme in 1976. This programme aimed to provide accessible and affordable family planning services to couples across the country. Media and in-person campaigns were conducted in Bangladesh to educate people about the importance of family planning, instant availability and usage of contraceptives across the country. In this way, the families realized the importance of having fewer children for the betterment of the economy and their personal health. As a result of this government policy, the fertility rate in Bangladesh has decreased from 7.5 percent in the 1970s to a current rate of 1.9 percent in 2024. As Pakistan and Bangladesh have similarities in the social, cultural, religious and economic aspects, Pakistan can follow such best practice to reduce its fertility rate to optimal level. Based on the above discussion on Pakistan's abnormal population growth, following strategies/reforms need to be adopted by the Governorment to address the overpopulation problem in the country;\n\nThe Governorment should formulate a five-year national action plan to control the overpopulation in the country by mutual deliberations of all relevant stakeholders. In the national action plan, the result-oriented family planning services and reproductive health education programs, using of contraceptives, availability of free and compulsory quality education, promotion of gender equality, poverty elimination, employment opportunities and fulfillment of fundamental rights must be ensured. The plan shall be effectively monitored by the oversight body to check the fertility and contraceptive prevalence rates on yearly basis and ultimate target would be to achieve the optimal fertility rate (less than 2 percent) and contraceptive prevalence rate (100 percent) in five years period.\n\nThe Government should pay special attention on empowerment of girls/women through provision of education and healthcare. This will lead to an increase in women's participation in the workforce. Educated and empowered girls/women are more likely to make informed decisions about their marriages, family planning and contraceptives. Minimum age of marriage (18 years or above) be legislated and enforced across Pakistan and pre-marital family planning counselling be made mandatory. Moreover, couples must be incentivized to have two children only and delay the first pregnancy till the age of 20 years. The Government should integrate family planning services with general/special health care facilities across the country.\n\nThe Government should, in collaboration with NGOs and community-based groups/organizations, must ensure 100 percent coverage of families and homes across Pakistan for delivery of family planning counselling and contraceptive services. The contraceptives should be easily available to general public free of cost at community access points. Political leaders, corporate sector, academia, judiciary, media, intelligentsia, civil society, religious leaders and youth must be sensitized about the overpopulation problem, so that they could take part in family planning campaigns. In Pakistan, religious leaders play a significant role in building the mindset of general public on any particular issue. So, religious leaders of all faiths must be engaged to advocate and endorse the national narrative on family planning.

This represents an addition of 804,930 people or a 31 percent growth rate.\n\nThe sub-region now has an annual growth rate of 2.8 percent and is ranked seventh out of 14 sub-regions in the country in terms of population growth, according to the report.\n\nLeaders in the sub-region say investment in infrastructure, healthcare, education, and other critical services will be crucial in ensuring that the growing population thrives.\n\nThis demographic shift presents opportunities and challenges for service delivery in the sub-region. Tooro Sub-region comprises eight districts (Kasese, Kitagwenda, Kamwenge, Ntoroko, Bundibugyo, Kyegegwa, Kabarole, Buyangabu, Kyenjojo, Ntoroko) and a city (Fort Portal).\n\nKyegegwa District had a 78 percent increase in population, rising from 281,637 in 2014 to 501,535 in 2024. This represents an addition of 219,898 people over the decade. Ntoroko District registered a 71 percent increase in population, rising from 67,005 in 2014 to 114,859 in 2024.\n\nKasese registered a population growth of 22 percent, from 694,987 to 847,027; Bundibugyo's growth rate stood at 18 percent, from 224,387 to 264,615; Kabarole had a 17 percent growth, from 196,749 to 230,603; while Fort Portal with 33 percent saw its population rise from 102,240 to 135,702; and Buyangabu had 28 percent growth, from 170,247 to 218,723.\n\nOthers are Kyenjojo with 29 percent growth, from 422,204 to 543,757; Kamwenge had a 24 percent growth rate, from 270,668 to 336,738; and Kitagwenda registered 29 percent growth, from 143,786 to 185,281.\n\nLeaders and stakeholders say a high population poses challenges that require immediate and strategic responses from both local and national governments.\n\nMr James Atuhiirwe, an economist, says the population surge necessitates a commensurate expansion in service delivery to meet the growing population's needs in key areas such as healthcare, roads, education, and employment.\n\n\"When the population increases, service delivery needs to match the population growth. Planners need to consider these numbers across different districts. For example, Ntoroko District has almost doubled in population, but has its budget increased? We need more health facilities, better roads, and other essential services,\" Mr Atuhiirwe says.\n\nAll the districts in Tooro Sub-region rely mainly on Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital for health services.\n\nDr Alex Adaku, the director of Fort Portal Regional Referral Hospital, says the facility has been relying on estimates to plan for the people in the entire region since 2014. He, however, says the new numbers will help them plan better.\n\nDr Adaku says to avoid putting excessive pressure on the hospital, much focus must be placed on disease prevention at the community level, allowing the facility to handle referred cases more effectively and minimising the expenditure on minor cases.\n\n\"The 3.4 million people in the Tooro Sub-region represent an impact on the health sector. The most important strategy is to focus on prevention so that fewer people come to our facility for clinical care. Health problems should be prevented in the community, and only those who need admission should come to the hospital,\" Dr Adaku says.\n\nHe says he is optimistic that the new population numbers will lead to an increase in the resource allocation to the facility by the government, adding that the current budget is insufficient to handle existing problems.\n\n\"We need to think of revising the budget. We have not yet achieved a 15 percent budget allocation to the health sector, which affects our interventions,\" Dr Adaku says.\n\nMr Robert Biita, the Kabarole District planner, says the population increase will impact service delivery, especially in health, education, roads, and water supply in the district.\n\n\"What we know now is that the population of our district has increased, and we need to adjust our planning. But to conclude, we first need to understand how many children will need immunisation and how many are school-going so that we can plan for more desks and classrooms,\" Mr Biita says.\n\nThe 2024/2025 financial year budget for Kabarole District is Shs29 billion, a decrease from the Shs35 billion budget of the 2023/2024 financial year.\n\nThe Fort Portal City Speaker, Mr Albert Ahebwa, says he is concerned about the timing of the census exercise, which coincided with the closing of the budgeting process for most local governments.\n\n\"We didn't get a chance to plan for new numbers because we didn't know them. For the new financial year coming, we have to consider the new numbers since the budget cycle is starting soon,\" he says.\n\nMr Ahebwa says they need to assess the district's budget to align it with the growing population for effective service delivery.\n\n\"A higher population puts pressure on services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The budget needs to cater to the expanding population to ensure adequate services and infrastructure are in place to support the community,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that the city is likely to face a significant challenge in ensuring all residents receive adequate services because the budget was based on the old population numbers from the 2014 census.\n\nIn Ntoroko District, the 2024/25 budget stands at Shs19.6 billion down from Shs21 billion in the 2023/24 financial year.\n\nThe district concluded the 2023/2024 financial year with a staffing shortage, particularly in the health department's primary health care (PHC) category. This shortage involves 26 critical positions, needing a total of 94 new recruits.\n\nThe district was unable to utilise Shs2.7 billion under PHC to recruit staff despite their request for a waiver from the Ministry of Public Service.\n\nThe district chairperson, Mr William Kasoro, says the government has been planning for the district based on the 2014 population of 67,005 people.\n\n\"As a district, it is very hard to align the new population figures with our budget. We have been grappling with implementing a budget based on estimates. Now, with a 71 percent population increase, can we have a budget increase by the same percentage to meet the required demands for services?\" he says.\n\nMr Kasoro suggests that planners at the national level need to revise the budget planning figures to reflect the district's new population for better services.\n\nHe says in the meantime, they will need partners to help serve the people.\n\nMr Kasoro adds that the district will need to construct more classrooms, recruit additional teachers, and provide sufficient educational materials to ensure quality education for all children.\n\n\"We are already seeing pressure with the meager resources we have. Many children born in the last 10 years are now reaching school age, but our existing infrastructures are not enough,\" he says.\n\nThe district also needs emergency funding of about Shs3 billion to address flood-related issues that have affected more than three schools. Some of the schools need renovation while others require reconstruction.\n\nThe district is also dealing with approximately 9,000 internally displaced persons from the 2019 Lake Albert floods, who need relocation to safer areas.\n\nThe Kyenjojo District Chairperson, Mr Richard Rubaihayo, says the population increase will put additional pressure on wetlands, as soil productivity is decreasing, which will exacerbate the effects of climate change.\n\n\"Our budget projection has been for 550,000 people, but the biggest challenge ahead lies in environmental and social services. We need to tarmac roads such as Kyenjojo-Kyakatwire, as traffic has increased compared to the previous year. Additionally, poverty levels are likely to rise,\" he says.\n\nMr Rubaihayo says the district's budget increased to Shs52 billion from Shs48 billion in the 2023/2024 financial year, though it remains insufficient.\n\nEnvironmentalists have warned that with increasing population numbers, there will be more pressure on land for settlement. They stressed the need for the government to allocate more funds to mitigate climate change.\n\nKasese, Bunyangabu, Kabarole, Ntoroko, and Bundibugyo have experienced the effects of climate change over the years, including floods and mudslides that have killed dozens of people, displaced others, and destroyed property.\n\n\"This time, we need to be serious about the increased population. I expect people to encroach on wetlands and riverbanks, and we will see many developments coming up at the expense of the environment. My appeal to the government is to plan better for this growing population,\" Mr Alex Bwambale, an environmentalist from Kasese, says.\n\nWhat they say\n\nMr James Atuhiirwe, an economist: When the population increases, service delivery needs to match the population growth. Planners need to consider these numbers across different districts. For example, Ntoroko District has almost doubled in population, but has its budget increased? We need more health facilities, better roads, and other essential services.\n\nMr Robert Biita, the Kabarole District planner: What we know now is that the population of our district has increased, and we need to adjust our planning. But to conclude, we first need to understand how many children will need immunisation and how many are school-going so that we can plan for more desks and classrooms.\n\nMr Alex Bwambale, an environmentalist: This time, we need to be serious about the increased population.

These population estimates and projections come from the latest revision of the UN World Urbanisation Prospects.

Questi dati forniscono una guida cruciale per i politici che cercano di promuovere lo sviluppo sostenibile, ottimizzare l'allocazione delle risorse e garantire l'accesso ai servizi sociali essenziali per tutti.\n\nConferenza stampa (11 luglio, 12:30 EDT)\n\nNavid Hanif, Assistente del Segretario Generale delle Nazioni Unite per lo Sviluppo Economico, UN DESA, John Wilmoth, Direttore della Divisione Popolazione, UN DESA e Clare Menozzi, Funzionario Senior per gli Affari della Popolazione, Divisione Popolazione, UN DESA, presenteranno i risultati principali del rapporto dopo il briefing di mezzogiorno dell'11 luglio.\n\nIl lancio pu\u00f2 essere seguito sulla WebTV delle Nazioni Unite( https://webtv.un.org/en)\n\nThe demographic landscape has evolved greatly, with rapid fertility declines in populous countries likely causing the global population to peak within this century (80 percent probability), contrasting with a decade ago when the probability was around 30 per cent. The report uses the analytical framework of the demographic transition to explore population trends and offers policy recommendations for adjusting to changing population sizes, age structures, and distributions. The earlier and lower population peak has significant implications for sustainability, aligning with the 1994 ICPD's goals to reduce population growth, poverty, and unsustainable consumption.\n\nThe following key messages are based on World Population Prospects 2024: Summary of Results, prepared by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA).\n\nTen key messages\n\n1. The world's population is likely to peak within the current century.\n\nThe world's population is expected to continue growing for another 50 or 60 years, reaching a peak of around 10.3 billion people in the mid-2080s, up from 8.2 billion in 2024. After peaking, it is projected to start declining, gradually falling to 10.2 billion people by the end of the century.\n\n2. One in four people globally lives in a country whose population has already peaked in size.\n\nIn 63 countries and areas, containing 28 per cent of the world's population in 2024, the size of the population peaked before 2024. In 48 countries and areas, with 10 per cent of the world's population in 2024, population size is projected to peak between 2025 and 2054. In the remaining 126 countries and areas, the population is likely to continue growing through 2054, potentially reaching a peak later in the century or beyond 2100.\n\n3. Women today bear, one child fewer, on average, than they did around 1990.\n\nCurrently, the global fertility rate stands at 2.3 live births per woman, down from 3.3 births in 1990. More than half of all countries and areas globally have fertility below 2.1 births per woman, the level required for a population to maintain a constant size in the long run without migration.\n\n4. Early childbearing has harmful effects on young mothers and their children.\n\nIn 2024, 4.7 million babies, or about 3.5 per cent of the total worldwide, were born to mothers under age 18 - and some 340,000, to girls under age 15 - with serious consequences for the health and well-being of both the young mothers and their children. Investing in the education of youth, especially girls, and increasing the ages at marriage and first childbearing in countries where these milestone events tend to occur early will have positive effects on women's health, educational attainment and labour force participation.\n\n5. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, global life expectancy is rising once again.\n\nGlobally, life expectancy at birth reached 73.3 years in 2024, an increase of 8.4 years since 1995. Further reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average longevity of around 77.4 years globally in 2054. Since 2022, life expectancy has returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in nearly all countries and areas.\n\n6. The main driver of global population increase through mid-century will be the momentum created by growth in the past.\n\nThe number of women at ages 15-49 is projected to grow from nearly 2 billion in 2024 to a peak of around 2.2 billion in the late 2050s, driving continued growth even if the number of births per woman falls to the replacement level. Today's youthful age structure, which is a product of past growth, will account for 79 per cent of the population increase through 2054, adding about 1.4 billion people.\n\n7. Countries with youthful populations and declining fertility have a limited time to benefit economically from an increasing concentration of population in the working ages.\n\nIn about 100 countries or areas, the working-age population (between 20 and 64 years) will grow through 2054, offering a window of opportunity known as the demographic dividend. To capitalize on this opportunity, countries must invest in education, health, and infrastructure, and implement reforms to create jobs and improve government efficiency.\n\n8. By 2080, persons aged 65 or older will outnumber children under 18.\n\nBy the late 2070s, the global population aged 65 and older is projected to reach 2.2 billion, exceeding the number of children under 18. By the mid-2030s, those aged 80 and over will outnumber infants (1 year of age or less), reaching 265 million. Countries that are at more advanced stages in the process of demographic ageing should consider the use of technology to improve productivity at all ages. They should also design more opportunities for lifelong learning and re-training, support multigenerational workforces and create opportunities to extend working lives for those who can and want to continue working.\n\n9. For some populations, immigration will be the main driver of future growth.\n\nIn 50 countries and areas, immigration is projected to attenuate the decline in population size due to sustained low levels of fertility and an older age structure. However, in 14 countries and areas already experiencing ultra-low fertility, emigration is likely to contribute to reducing population size through 2054.\n\n10. Gender equality and women's empowerment help to counter rapid population growth or decline.\n\nDiscrimination and legal barriers limit women and adolescents' access to sexual and reproductive health services. Raising the legal marriage age and integrating family planning into primary health care can enhance women's education, economic participation, and reduce childbearing. In countries where populations have peaked already or are likely to peak in the next three decades, policies providing paid parental leave and flexible working arrangements, supporting affordable, high-quality childcare, providing comprehensive care for an ageing population; and encouraging an equal distribution of caregiving and household responsibilities between men and women can improve women's labor participation, support families, encourage childbearing and increase economic security for men and women at older ages.\n\nPrepared by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and\n\nSocial Affairs (UN DESA).

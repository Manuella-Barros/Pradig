Chalmers Foundation's initial pledge of $25,000 to the Boys and Girls Club of Lawrence's Teen Center, will run from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and will be the highlight of a weekend designed to raise money for

Chalmers Foundation fundraiser on Saturday afternoon at Royal Crest Lanes, located a few blocks west of KU's campus.\n\nAt the exact same time, 2 to 4 p.m., another highly-accomplished ex-Jayhawk playmaker -- overseas sensation Keith Langford -- visited with families while distributing free backpacks and school supplies at his local Wingstop Restaurant located a few streets south of Mt. Oread.\n\n\"Next year, we'll have to combine it. We'll have to figure out how to put a whole weekend together -- me, Keith and a couple other guys,\" said Chalmers. He's set to resume his nine-year NBA career in 2017-18 with the Grizzlies after spending last season rehabbing from Achilles surgery.\n\n\"I think it says a lot about the community of Kansas as a whole,\" said Chalmers, 31, about the coincidence that two former Jayhawks would sponsor charity events the same summer weekend in Lawrence. \"The players that come through here, we love giving back,\" added Chalmers.\n\nThe 33-year-old Langford -- who recently signed a one-year deal worth $2.2 million to continue his 13-year pro career with the Shenzhen Leopards in China -- said he was happy to be serving the community with Chalmers, a player Langford hosted on Chalmers' recruiting trip from Anchorage, Alaska to KU during the 2004-05 season.\n\n\"It shows how attached the players are to the community and vice versa,\" said Langford. He and wife Brittany, co-owners of the Wingstop, handed out all but 20 of their backpacks in just one hour. \"I think it also speaks to the level of success guys have had since they've left. Now being able to give back ... it speaks volumes.\n\n\"If I remember correctly, Mario has been active since day one. You see these things and others (players) kind of follow suit. Seeing the response, this makes me want to do more,\" Langford added. \"It's been 16 years since I got to this campus. To come here today and see a full house ... I was really pleased. A lot of people remembered my time here. A lot of people said they were glad to see someone helping out.\"\n\nLangford is KU's eighth-leading scorer of all-time (1,812 points) who played in a pair of Final Fours and one Elite Eight. Chalmers is KU's 29th-leading scorer (1,341 points in three seasons), who hit the shot that sent the 2008 NCAA title game against Memphis into overtime.\n\nKU, of course, won that game and the '08 national championship.\n\n\"I really can't believe it. I thought I'd be a forgotten face out here nine, ten years later,\" Chalmers said. \"I mean the fans still love me. The kids still love me. I just come back and give as much as I can. I love giving back. That's something my mom and dad always preached to me, giving back to a community that gave to you.\"\n\nChalmers -- whose foundation supports cancer research and youth initiatives in the area including funds for the Boys and Girls Club's Teen Center -- said he's looking forward to mounting a comeback during the upcoming NBA season.\n\n\"I'll be better than new,\" Chalmers said. \"It was a whole 17 months (of rehab). Just going through that ... finally a team took a chance, said they think I'm ready. I'm ready now. I'm excited to be with Memphis. It's a good place to be. I left there on a good note. I'm coming back on a good note.\"\n\nChalmers played seven seasons in Miami where he won two NBA titles, then after opening the 2015-16 season as a member of the Heat, was traded to Memphis where he ruptured his right Achilles on March 9, 2016. He's been out ever since.\n\n\"I've been in Memphis working out trying to get ready. Ben and Wayne are with me in Memphis,\" he said, referring to former KU players Ben McLemore and Wayne Selden. \"We've got a little Jayhawk connection there.\"\n\nFort Worth, Texas native Langford started his pro career with the San Antonio Spurs after playing four seasons at KU, then headed overseas where he's made millions with teams in Russia, Israel, Italy and now China. A huge offseason acquisition, he'll be asked to put up a lot of points this season.\n\n\"I'm a scorer. I can go out and average 15 rebounds a game and they are going to ask me, 'Where are the points?''' Langford said. \"At this point, that's my job. I take pride (in scoring). I enjoy it, embrace it. One good thing (about playing in China) is their season ends early. There's flexibility to jump back into Europe, if that's what I want to do, maybe rest a little longer. I'm not as young as I used to be,\" he added, smiling.\n\nChalmers' foundation, which sponsored a VIP event Friday night at The Oread Hotel and the bowling on Saturday, will hold another event Monday -- a golf tournament at The Jayhawk Club (formerly Alvamar).\n\n\"Mario is great. To come back and do this for the kids is big. For the KU family it's always good to have him back in Lawrence,\" said former KU guard Nick Bradford, the girls basketball coach at Olathe North who brought his family to the bowling event with former KU guard Jeff Hawkins.\n\n\"It's great the love everybody shows him here,\" added Bradford, who was hoping to have time to visit with Langford on Saturday as well. \"Everything that Keith does here, everything Mario does here ... it's just great to have these guys back. They are great examples of doing everything the right way. They are proud to represent KU the right way on and off the court,\" Bradford noted.", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3579, "textStart": 3566, "amb": false, "date": "2016-03-09"}], "time": "02:01:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "02:01:00", "title": "Guess who's back in town?

I've been practicing. I've been doing a little 'Topgolf' here lately. I may do a little something sometime. I can't hit this year. I've got to wait until everything goes through with Memphis,\" Chalmers, a former Kansas basketball guard and nine-year NBA veteran said Monday from The Jayhawk Club, formerly known as Alvamar Golf Club.\n\nChalmers, 31, is coming off 17-month rehab following Achilles tendon surgery and is set to resume his NBA career on a one-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies after a full year off. He didn't want to risk straining any muscles at his ninth-annual golf fundraiser.\n\nInstead the 6-foot-2, 190-pounder visited with 100 or so golfers as they traversed the course on a sunny afternoon.\n\nOn Saturday, Chalmers signed autographs and posed for pictures at his charity bowling event at Royal Crest Lanes. That event, like Monday's, raised funds for his Mario V. Chalmers Foundation, which benefits youth initiatives and cancer research.\n\n\"My bowling game is better (than my golf game),\" Chalmers said with a smile. \"I got into bowling because I took a bowling class at KU. I've been into it since then.\n\n\"They say golf is the money sport, so it's good to come out here and have a good time, be able to talk to everybody, interact,\" he added.\n\nChalmers said he will be back next year for his 10th annual bowling and golf events.\n\n\"It's our ninth year doing it and we're still going strong, so we're going to keep it going. This (turnout) shows the community still loves me. They come out here and support,\" Chalmers said.\n\nChalmers' three-point bucket forced overtime in KU's 2008 NCAA title game victory over Memphis. He's also won two NBA championships with the Miami Heat.\n\n\"I try to come back as much as I can and do good events for the community,\" he said. \"Boys & Girls Club (one of beneficiaries) is what got me started at a young age, somewhere to go and play basketball and stay off the streets. It's good to reconnect with a program that gave you an opportunity to make a better life for yourself.\"\n\nKansas assistant coach Kurtis Townsend and video coordinator/former Chalmers teammate Jeremy Case played in the scramble golf event, as did KU women's coach Brandon Schneider.\n\nESPN.com on Monday declared Kansas the \"clear-cut biggest winner of the (transfer) market,\" during college basketball's offseason. The Jayhawks beat out Arizona State, North Carolina State, North Carolina, Oregon and Iowa State, who also picked up transfers.\n\n\"Bill Self and the Jayhawks made a splash a year ago in the transfer market, adding Mississippi State transfer Malik Newman. This year the Jayhawks added a trio of productive players: The Lawson brothers (K.J. and Dedric) from Memphis and Charlie Moore, a point guard from Chicago who played his freshman season last year at Cal,\" wrote Jeff Goodman and Jeff Borzello on the website.\n\n\"Dedric Lawson averaged 19.2 points and 9.9 boards, is one of the most talented frontcourt players in the country and considered leaving for the NBA draft. His brother, K.J., averaged 12.3 points and 8.1 boards a year ago. Both players, in addition to Moore, who averaged 12.2 points and 3.5 assists at Cal, will sit out this season,\" Goodman and Borzello added in their article.\n\nHere's what they had to say about Iowa State: \"Iowa State picked up two graduate transfers that should help immediately in Jeff Beverly, who averaged 15.8 points and 5.9 rebounds at UT-San Antonio, and Hans Brase, who put up 11.5 points and 7.5 rebounds at Princeton in 2014-15 before missing most of the past two seasons with injury. (Coach Steve) Prohm also landed two high-major sit-out transfers: Marial Shayok (Virginia) and Michael Jacobson (Nebraska). Shayok is a versatile and strong perimeter player, while Jacobson averaged 6.2 rebounds last season for the Cornhuskers.\"\n\nSeven-foot McDonald's All-America center Mitchell Robinson figures to make a decision on his basketball future \"very soon, perhaps within the next few days,\" Rivals.com's Eric Bossi wrote Monday.\n\nRobinson, the No. 8-ranked player in the recruiting class of 2017 by Rivals.com, as of 6 p.m., Monday had not commented since completing his recruiting visit to Kansas on Saturday.\n\nBecause Robinson recently participated in summer practices with Western Kentucky's team before being released from his letter of intent, he would have to receive a waiver from the NCAA in order to play for another Division I team without having to sit out a season.\n\nRobinson apparently will either (a.) attend Kansas for a year and see if the NCAA grants him a waiver to play in games; (b.) decide to play overseas or (c.) work out with trainers in preparation for the 2018 NBA Draft. He's expected to be a lottery pick.\n\nThe Jayhawks may wish to add Robinson even if he's ineligible for participation in games. He could practice with a group of bigs that includes Udoka Azubuike, Billy Preston and Mitch Lightfoot as well as Memphis transfer Dedric Lawson, who will practice this season but not play in games until 2018-19 in accordance with NCAA transfer rules.", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "time": "00:36:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "00:36:00", "title": "Mario

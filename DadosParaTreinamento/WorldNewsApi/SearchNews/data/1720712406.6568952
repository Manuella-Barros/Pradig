Bonnye Mavis Lear, who was an administrator at the park's Club 33, suffered severe injuries to her head around 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday. Details about the incident were released by police Sgt. John McClintock. 'It didn\u2019t have to end this way. All of this mess could\u2019ve been avoided if the driver of the golf cart wasn\u2019t driving recklessly.' She was quickly taken to the hospital and eventually succumbed to her injuries two days later. While the police have insisted that the incident was a traffic collision, Lear's colleagues have said that she was thrown off the golf cart when the driver \"recklessly\" struck a bump in the road, according to the report. Lear was reportedly riding in a rear-facing seat of the golf cart that was traveling at 20 miles per hour behind Critter County, a temporarily closed part of the park. The cart suddenly hit the bump, sending Lear off the vehicle. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have to end this way. All of this mess could\u2019ve been avoided if the driver of the golf cart wasn\u2019t driving recklessly,\u201d Rae Delgado, a California Adventure attractions cast member, said. \u201cThe golf cart from the entertainment department was brand new. How the hell could it fall apart?! It\u2019s just so unfair to us & the family.\u201d Fox News Digital said they reached out to Disneyland for comment. \u201cShe went to grab the handrail, it gave way and sent her out of the vehicle. We do not know if the passengers were aware that she had fallen out,\u201d Delgado continued. As a result, Lear suffered head trauma and a fractured skull that could not be solved in surgery. Delgado went on to say that the Anaheim resort managers told cast members not to say anything about the incident surrounding her death. The Disneyland veteran had been an employee for 24 years, per reports. \u201cWe are heartbroken by the loss of Bonnye and offer our sincere condolences to everyone who cared for her,\u201d Disneyland Resort President Ken Potrock said, according to Fox News Digital. \u201cAt this time, we are focused on supporting her family and our cast members through this tragic event and making sure they have the resources they need.\u201d The authorities are investigating the incident.

David Trone told WJZ his campaign is full steam ahead as he looks to secure his place on the November ticket.\n\nTrone, who's been serving in the U.S. House since 2019, is looking to switch chambers. He's going against Angela Alsobrooks in the May primary, who is currently the county executive for Prince George's County.\n\nIn a sit-down interview with WJZ's Dennis Valera, Trone said he was inspired to run shortly after U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin announced his retirement last year.\n\nWhile describing himself, Trone declined to use the word politician, instead opting for public servant.\n\n\"I'm a servant of the folks in the state of Maryland, I'm a servant for this country,\" he said. \"[I want to] move the needle on stuff that's been left behind: addiction, mental health, systemic racism in our criminal justice system.\"\n\nOn those issues, Trone has co-sponsored a number of bills that've passed both chambers during his time in Congress, and some have been enacted into law.\n\nWhen it comes to his record, Trone points to his bipartisan approach. He'll work with anyone to get things done.\n\n\"We never ask people, 'Are you Republican or Democrat?' We ask, 'How do we get the job done?'\" he said. \"We're already working in the Senate and have been for six years...my whole focus is Republicans in the Senate, ten votes. I need 60 to get [bills] through.\"\n\nWhile Trone hasn't been shy about touting his record, he also isn't shy about his finances. He's set records for the amount of money he himself has fueled into his campaigns. For this current one, he's put in more than $40 million.\n\nThe owner of alcohol retailer Total Wine & More says being able to fund his own campaign keeps him away from corporations and special interests.\n\n\"The fact I'm willing to use my money to keep that independence so I'm not owned by Exxon and I'm not owned by Pfizer. I'm only [in Congress] for the people of Maryland, the people of America -- any people really like that,\" Trone said.\n\nDespite the deep pockets, Trone said he's able to relate to anyone, especially because of his humble beginnings.\n\n\"We didn't even have a toilet in our house when I was 11 or 12-years-old. At 28, our farm went bankrupt. My dad was an abusive alcoholic and we lost everything. I built from zero to where I am,\" he said.\n\nWhile he still has to win the primary, Trone already has November on his mind, particularly with Hogan in the race.\n\n\"That really changed things up because now folks realize if we don't beat Larry Hogan, we lose control of the Senate,\" Trone said. \"Which is something that's kind of scary for a lot of folks.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com",

I've also read the other candidates' complaints about it but, to me, the money he's spending was hard-earned and means that his vote belongs to Marylanders, not anyone else.\n\nI'm the proud son of a single mother. Growing up we faced hard times living in Section 8 housing and relying on food stamps to get by. So when I read Trone's story, I understood it. Looking at the candidate now, I couldn't believe that he grew up so poor -- with an outhouse no less. As a kid, he worked shoveling chicken coops and hog pens to help his family pay the bills. He worked his way through school on student loans. His story isn't the same as mine, but we both know what it's like to struggle to survive and succeed.\n\nI support Trone because I know he has fought and will continue to fight so more people like us can rise from hard times and provide for their families. That's just who he is: a fighter with skin in the game. We need someone in the Senate who can solve our biggest problems because they've lived them.

David Trone Visits Port of Baltimore with Committee Colleagues, Urges 100 percent Federal Cost Share for Key Bridge\n\nRep. Trone looks at the Dali crash site from aboard a U.S. Coast Guard vessel.\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. -- Yesterday, Congressman David Trone (D-MD) visited the Port of Baltimore with his Appropriations Committee colleagues to push for a 100 percent federal cost share in funding the Francis Scott Key Bridge rebuild. As the port remains crucial for commerce and employment in Maryland, the collapse has prompted urgent calls for action to mitigate the economic impact and prevent further disruption. Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) and Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) were among the many committee members in attendance, as well as Governor Wes Moore and Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young.\n\nLast month, Trone joined the Maryland Delegation in introducing the Baltimore BRIDGE Relief Act to ensure the federal government supports 100 percent of the replacement of the bridge. Emergency Relief funding automatically has a 100 percent federal cost share for the first 270 days after the disaster. Maryland already has received $60 million in Emergency Relief funds.\n\nThe Key Bridge's collapse has disrupted daily commutes, jobs, and America's supply chain. Rebuilding the bridge and reopening the Port of Baltimore is not only essential for Marylanders, but for folks across the nation. The Port is a pillar of our nation's economy: supporting nearly 150,000 jobs, importing more vehicles than any other port, and contributing over $15 million to the economy every day.\n\n\"As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I'm working day and night to deploy federal funding as quickly as possible because I know how important it is to get this bridge up and running again. Our goal is to pass a bipartisan funding package that supports 100 percent of the replacement of this critical bridge, \" said Congressman Trone. \"Our community cannot afford to wait, the economic and human costs of inaction are too high. Now is the time to put people over politics or risk a potential economic crisis in Maryland and across the country.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Trone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Trone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Baltimore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port of Baltimore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Bridge_(Washington,_D.C.)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Key Bridge (Washington, D.C.)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Appropriations", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Appropriations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalanda_Young", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shalanda Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_DeLauro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rosa DeLauro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_member", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ranking member"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Management_and_Budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Office of Management and Budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Trick_Capturing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Trick Capturing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Bridges_and_Tunnels", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Bridges and Tunnels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Toll_and_Automated", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Toll and Automated", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555117", "eventUri": "eng-9555117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The boys and young men who clean car windshields at busy intersections are not as visible as they once were, and that's owing in large measure to the work of the Squeegee Collaborative, convened by Mayor Brandon Scott, to get squeegee guys off the streets, into jobs or back in school.\n\nMatthew Cooper, whose friends in West Baltimore included squeegee guys, joined the collaborative and made a 26-minute film about the effort. He thought the public could benefit from \"understanding the misunderstood,\" which is the subtitle of his documentary, \"Squeegee Kids.\" Though his documentary arrives well after the tragic height of the squeegee controversy, I admire what Cooper set out to do. He's in the camp of people who, instead of just complaining or just listening to the uproar, got involved.\n\nCooper's documentary follows a teenager, Corey Thompson, as he explains why he sometimes picks up a squeegee and spray bottle - to help his mother and siblings with household expenses. \"I consider myself the man of the house,\" he says, at the age of 13. The film, while offering some of the hard-line views we heard about squeegee crews, is crafted with genuine empathy, something sadly lacking in too many realms of life.\n\nAs the years go by, it's easy to grow tired of the long, sad story of generational poverty and less sympathetic to those who struggle. You have to push yourself to understand and be mindful. Cooper's film helps that way. There's a screening of it on Thursday, May 23 at 7 p.m. at the Senator Theatre.\n\n-o-\n\nNobody asked me, but Gov. Wes Moore's decision to praise Scott but not endorse the mayor for re-election was pretty weird.\n\nEven weirder was the Baltimore Sheriff Sam Cogen's endorsement of Sheila Dixon for mayor because of disagreements with Scott. \"I sort of feel like I'm not getting anything from him [Scott] -- he's the eating bear,\" Cogen said. \"So when the bear comes to eat you, you don't play dead for that bear, you fight that bear. And that's sort of like where I am right now.\"\n\nWho knew Baltimore had a sheriff into Zen? So cool.\n\nNobody asked me, but the only thing more nightmarish than his campaign commercials would be Robin Ficker, the disbarred attorney and perennial candidate, actually winning an election.\n\nFicker's \"border crisis\" spot seems to be running as frequently as those for his most prominent opponent in the Republican Senate primary, Larry Hogan. The former Maryland governor deserves special thanks. His \"border crisis\" commercial -- with Larry The Lawman sporting a flak jacket, baseball cap and shades while patrolling the Rio Grande -- provides perfect comic relief to counter Ficker's dystopian nightmare.\n\nNobody asked me, but it appears that a FOX-owned-and-operated TV station in Washington resorted to hyperbole to make a Democratic politician look bad. There's a shock for ya! Apparently, Senate candidate David Trone was not happy with the way a FOX 5 reporter focused on Trone's assertion that the U.S. criminal justice system is \"systemically racist.\" Trone used those two words last week in the second part of a 120-word thread on X. He said the system \"doesn't work for everybody, and things like increased police presence don't make everyone feel safer. We must work to rebuild trust between communities and law enforcement.\" Commentators on X immediately hammered Trone for wanting to \"defund the police.\" Of course, that's the typical reaction whenever someone suggests, as Trone did, that there are complex problems at the root of crime - mental illness, poverty, drug addiction - that more policing won't solve. Trone should know that. He should know that raising racism annoys people who believe they live in a post-racial America. He also should know that FOX thrives on, and sometimes contrives, controversy.\n\nNonetheless, when confronted after a speech in a Rockville synagogue, Trone accused the FOX 5 reporter of ignoring the context of his comments when they were first reported. It was captured by camera, and the story appeared under this headline: \"Rep. David Trone explodes in anger at FOX 5 when asked about his social media posts.\"\n\nPlease. Trone hardly \"exploded.\" I'd say he objected strongly to the lack of context in the news report, and I'd further say that, if he expected context, he expected way too much. The only person who could have given context on camera to his reasonable thoughts about crime was David Trone, and he should have at least tried.\n\nNobody asked me, but Anthony Santander is one of the most underrated players in Major League Baseball.\n\nNobody asked me, but it's grand that Hood College is starting a women's Division III ice hockey team. The Blazers will compete in the United Collegiate Hockey Conference, starting in the fall, and play their home games at the Skate Frederick rink. Hood will be the second women's NCAA team in Maryland. Stevenson University's women also compete in the UCHC. They play at the Reisterstown Sportsplex.\n\nNobody asked me, but spring is a particularly good time for a weekday visit to the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore. I give three reasons: Druid Hill Park, where the zoo is located, looks great; you could see the ground hornbills and their new baby - the first in 10 years; and because it's a pleasure to watch little kids on field trips react to seeing exotic animals for the first time.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

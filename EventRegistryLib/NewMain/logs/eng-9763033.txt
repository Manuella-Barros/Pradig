for the perfect human male body in his famous work, the Vitruvian Man.\n\nThe premise behind this is that the closer the ratios of a face or body are to the number 1.618 (Phi), the more beautiful they become.\n\nA top ten list of current female celebrities was compiled using the latest computerised mapping techniques by Harley Street facial cosmetic surgeon Dr Julian De Silva, who uses the technology in his work.\n\nAccording to Dr Da Silva's research, Taylor-Joy's eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips, chin, jaw and facial shape were measured and came closest to the ancient Greeks' idea of perfection.\n\nDune star Zendaya landed in second place with 94.37%, while model Bella Hadid was third with 94.35% and Barbie actress Margot Robbie, 33, came fourth with 93.43%.\n\nAll the top ten

out 94.66% accurate to the Greek Golden Ratio of Beauty Phi, which measures physical perfection, narrowly ahead of Zendays, who came in second with 94.37% and Bella Hadid, whose 94.35% accuracy secured her third place.\n\nComputerised facial mapping techniques used for the measurements were developed by Harley Street facial cosmetic surgeon Dr Julian De Silva, and he found Anya, 28, to be the \"clear winner\".\n\nDr De Silva, who runs the Centre For Advanced Facial Cosmetic And Plastic Surgery in London, explained: \"Anya Taylor-Joy was the clear winner when all elements of the face were measured for physical perfection.\n\n\"She had the highest overall reading for the positioning of her eyes, with a score of 98.9%, which is only 1.1% away from being the perfect shape.\n\n\"Anya also had the highest score for her eyebrows and was close to the top in almost every category apart from her lips.\n\n\"Zendaya was a close second and achieved the second highest score for her lips with a mark of 99.5%.\n\n\"Bella Hadid was third, achieving the top score for her chin and high scores across most facial features apart from her brow area.\n\n\"Margot Robbie was fourth, scoring highly in all categories except the brow area.\n\n\"These brand new computer mapping techniques allow us to solve some of the mysteries of what it is that makes someone physically beautiful and the technology is useful when planning patients' surgery.\"\n\nAlthough she only placed sixth on the list of most beautiful women, Beyonce was found to have a near-perfect face shape, scoring 99.6%.\n\nThe Golden Ratio was a mathematical equation devised by the Greeks in an attempt to measure beauty and was famously used by Leonardo Da Vinci for the perfect human male body in his work 'The Virtruvian Man'.\n\nFind out more details of the top ten and Dr Julian De Silva's Golden Ratio analysis on his Instagram @drjuliandesilva\n\nThe 10 most beautiful women in the world according to their

People always have something to say, but what I have to say is, I've always been misunderstood in my industry and by the people around me.'\n\nShe explained: 'I was the uglier sister. I was the brunette. I wasn't as cool as Gigi, not as outgoing. That's really what people said about me. And unfortunately when you get told things so many times, you do just believe it.\n\n'I always ask myself, how did a girl with incredible insecurities, anxiety, depression, body-image issues, eating issues, who hates to be touched, who has intense social anxiety -- what was I doing getting into this business? But over the years I became a good actress.\n\n'I put on a very smiley face, or a very strong face. I always felt like I had something to prove. People can say anything about how I look, about how I talk, about how I act. But in seven years I never missed a job, canceled a job, was late to a job. No one can ever say that I don't work my a*s off.'\n\nDr De Silva said: 'Bella topped the table for the shape of her chin which, with a score of 99.7 per cent, was only 0.3 per cent away from being the perfect shape.'\n\n4.

revealed", "body": "Read on to find out the top 10 most beautiful in the world according to the mathematical formula\n\nANYA Taylor-Joy is the most beautiful woman in the world -- according to an ancient mathematical formula.\n\nThe Queen's Gambit actress, 28, came closest to the Greeks' idea of perfection -- as defined by their \"golden ratio\".\n\nHer eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips, chin, jaw and facial shape were among those mapped and measured by cosmetic surgeons.\n\nThey were found to be 94.66 per cent in line with the ideal ratio of 1.618, sometimes exp-ressed as the Greek letter phi.\n\nHer eyes scored particularly highly at 98.9 per cent but was let down slightly by her lips.\n\nHarley Street cosmetic surgeon Dr Julian De Silva, who scanned the famous faces, said: \"Anya Taylor-Joy was the clear winner when all elements of the face were measured for physical perfection.\n\n\"She had the highest overall reading for the positioning of her eyes, with a score of 98.9%, which is only 1.1% away from being the perfect shape.\n\n\"Anya also had the highest score for her eyebrows and was close to the top in almost every category apart from her lips.\n\n\"These brand new computer mapping techniques allow us to solve some of the mysteries of what it is that makes someone physically beautiful and the technology is useful when planning patients' surgery.\"\n\nActress Zendaya, 27, was second, with her lips just 0.5 per cent away from perfection, while model Bella Hadid, also 27, scored 99.7 per cent for her chin and was third overall.\n\nThe Golden Ratio was a mathematical equation devised by the Greeks in an attempt to measure beauty.\n\nThe ratio can be applied to anything and was used by Leonardo Da Vinci for the perfect human male body in his famous work, the Vitruvian Man.\n\nThe premise behind this is that the closer the ratios of a face or body are to the number 1.618 (Phi), the more beautiful they become.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk",

'Irreplaceable' Ancient Gold Jewellery Stolen From Cambridgeshire Museum", "body": "Credit: British Museum/Cambridgeshire County Council/Cambridgeshire Police/Cover Images Cambridgeshire Police are hunting for two thieves who broke into Ely Museum and stole two unique items of gold Bronze Age jewellery in the early hours of Tuesday (7May2024) morning. The East Cambridgeshire gold torc and a gold bracelet, both dating from the Bronze Age, were taken. Explaining their importance, Elie Hughes, curator at Ely Museum, said: \"We are devastated by the loss to the museum and to the local heritage of the region. It is a huge blow after the incredible support from the community in acquiring the torc in 2017. As a culturally significant object, it cannot be replaced. Our priority now is working with the police to locate the stolen objects.\" Found in East Cambridgeshire by a metal detectorist, the torc is regarded as the best to be found in England in more than a century. It is much larger than usual examples and is made of 730g of almost pure gold. The find was made in a ploughed field in East Cambridgeshire and was reported to the local Finds Liaison Officer. Like the torc, the gold bracelet is also in pristine condition despite being about 3000 years old. It was found in 2011 in East Cambridgeshire by a metal detectorist. Police have released security footage of the theft in the hope the perpetrators can be caught. DI Kiri Mazur said: \"We have released this CCTV, not in the hope someone will recognise the figures, but to try to jog memories and encourage anyone with information to come forward. \"We are focused on identifying the offenders, tracing the items, and returning them to their rightful place and are working closely with staff at Ely Museum to follow all lines of inquiry. \"I am very keen to hear from anyone who may be able to provide information or saw two people on e-scooters in the vicinity of the museum, car park and pedestrian walkways at the back of the museum, the council offices and the Grange Car Park, between 12am and 2am on Tuesday.\" Anyone who has any information is urged to contact police via 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.", "source": {"uri": "wataugademocrat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Watauga Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cover_media@wataugademocrat.com", "name": "Cover Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torc", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Torc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cambridgeshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Cambridgeshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "East Cambridgeshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Cambridgeshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ely,_Cambridgeshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ely, Cambridgeshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ely, Cambridgeshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire_County_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cambridgeshire County Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracelet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bracelet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_detector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal detector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cambridgeshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_grange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monastic grange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Museum_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Museum Stores", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wataugademocrat.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/f5/1f5964f3-2717-54e8-8f4e-71adb57ad1bb/663cf72332a0f.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C23&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549903", "eventUri": "eng-9549903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

It is a huge blow after the incredible support from the community in acquiring the torc in 2017. As a culturally significant object, it cannot be replaced.

Shaped from a square section of a bar of gold, it was twisted and burnished to form this spectacular piece. The precise measurements and delicate twists are a testament to their skill!\" the museum said on Facebook in 2017.\n\nIt is one of the heaviest and longest ever found in the U.K., the museum said on Facebook last year, and it has a bit of mystery.\n\n\"The East Cambridgeshire Gold Torc is too large to be a necklace, or even a belt. Without written sources, we can only speculate how the torc was used. Perhaps it was designed to be worn over heavy clothes or made for a pregnant woman, a statue, or even a ceremonial animal. There is no way to know if it was owned by one person of high status, or owned collectively by a group,\" the museum wrote in 2023.\n\nTelevision presenter Ray Mears called the torc one of the \"most remarkable finds in British history,\" in a segment for the BBC in 2018, and he said the people of the Bronze Age were \"tireless experimenters\" who were often underestimated.\n\n\"The theft of these items is despicable, and we are focused on identifying the offenders, tracing the items, and returning them to their rightful place,\" Mazur said in the May 7 Facebook post.\n\nThe Ely Museum is in

BBC Look East and Harriet Heywood - BBC News, Cambridgeshire\n\nPolice have released CCTV footage of two people after gold objects dating back 3,000 years were stolen from a museum.\n\nThe Bronze Age jewellery - a gold torc and a gold bracelet - were stolen during a break-in at Ely Museum, Cambridgeshire, on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to the BBC, curator Elie Hughes said the loss felt \"like grief\" as part of their local heritage was taken.\n\nBoth items were initially found in East Cambridgeshire and the torc was acquired for the museum through grants and donations.\n\nCambridgeshire Police said the museum was broken into between 00:00 and 02:00 BST.\n\nIn footage released by the force, two people can be seen entering the building through a window and then quickly moving past a security camera in the venue.\n\nDet Insp Kiri Mazur said: \"We have released this CCTV, not in the hope someone will recognise the figures, but to try to jog memories and encourage anyone with information to come forward.\n\n\"I am very keen to hear from anyone who may be able to provide information or saw two people on e-scooters in the vicinity of the museum, car park and pedestrian walkways at the back of the museum, the council offices and the Grange Car Park.\"\n\nJane Greaves, chair of trustees for Ely Museum, said the break-in alert was a \"call you never want to get\".\n\n\"This is where the object was from, it belongs here and it belongs to the people of Ely,\" Ms Greaves said.\n\n\"It is hugely devastating that it has been stolen and taken from the people in this way.\n\n\"It feels personal.. the people who stole this wanted it and went to lengths to take it.\n\n\"We live and hope, that's all we can do.\"\n\nBoth items were found in East Cambridgeshire by metal detectorists.\n\nThe torc, found in a ploughed field, is regarded as the best found in England in more than a century, as it is larger than many other examples and made of 730g (1lb 10oz) of almost pure gold.\n\nCurator Elie Hughes said the torc was unusual because it was so big that it could generously fit around a person's shoulders.\n\n\"What made it special was that no one knew what it was used for,\" Ms Hughes told the BBC.\n\n\"It's made from twisted gold, shaped a bit like fusilli pasta.\"\n\nShe added that the loss had not only been felt by the museum, but by the people of Ely.\n\n\"Not seeing it there feels horrible to be honest, it feels like grief.\n\n\"It is like someone is missing.. things aren't right.\n\nIt was important for the torc to be on display in Ely, where it was first found, Ms Hughes added.\n\n\"We worked hard to make that happen and people put their hands in their pocket to donate to acquire it and keep it local,\" she said.\n\n\"Thousands of local people could come in and see an object that was part of their local heritage and landscape.\n\n\"What stands out is that everyone is with us feeling the loss.. we are not alone in our anger and devastation.\"\n\nThey hoped to reopen the museum soon but without the two gold items.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The precise measurements and delicate twists are a testament to their skill!\" the museum said on Facebook in 2017.\n\nIt is one of the heaviest and longest ever found in the U.K., the museum said on Facebook last year, and it has a bit of mystery.\n\n\"The East Cambridgeshire Gold Torc is too large to be a necklace, or even a belt. Without written sources, we can only speculate how the torc was used. Perhaps it was designed to be worn over heavy clothes or made for a pregnant woman, a statue, or even a ceremonial animal. There is no way to know if it was owned by one person of high status, or owned collectively by a group,\" the museum wrote in 2023.\n\nTelevision presenter Ray Mears called the torc one of the \"most remarkable finds in British history,\" in a segment for the BBC in 2018, and he said the people of the Bronze Age were \"tireless experimenters\" who were often underestimated.\n\n\"The theft of these items is despicable, and we are focused on identifying the offenders, tracing the items, and returning them to their rightful place,\" Mazur said in the May 7 Facebook post.\n\nThe Ely Museum is in

Our priority now is working with the police to locate the stolen objects.\"\n\nThe torc, a type of rigid necklace described by the museum as its \"most prized object,\" was valued at about 220,000 pounds when the museum acquired it in 2017, according to BBC.\n\nThe torc weighs 730 grams and is made up of almost entirely pure gold, the museum says. A metal detectorist found the piece in 2015 while searching in a field. Museum historians believe the torc was buried to hide it from invading enemies or as an offering to a god.\n\nThe thieves broke into the museum at about 2 a.m., according to police. Detective Kiri Mazur said police released the footage hoping someone would recognize the two suspects.\n\n\"I am very keen to hear from anyone who may be able to provide information or saw two people on e-scooters in the vicinity of the museum, car park and pedestrian walkways at the back of the museum, the council offices, and the Grange Car Park, between 12 a.m. and 2 a.m. on Tuesday,\" Mazur said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kenneth_niemeyer@businessinsider.com", "name": "Kenneth Niemeyer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torc", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Torc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Italy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Regions of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_grange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monastic grange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_detector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metal detector"}}], "categories": [], "image": "https://i.insider.com/663cf8099686a6f37bfdbf69?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549903", "eventUri": "eng-9549903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

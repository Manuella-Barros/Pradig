If you stick to the minimum, you'll collect the bonus bets.\n\nThus, you can play it safe and still collect. Say you put down a $5 cash wager on the Pacers moneyline at +159. If Indiana won, you'd get $7.95 in profit, keep your cash stake AND earn the bonus bets, with the value varying slightly based on where you're located when you bet.\n\nEven if the Knicks won, you'd still collect the bonus bets but obviously wouldn't earn any profit.\n\nNew players only, 21+.

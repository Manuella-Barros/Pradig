{"id": 232045614, "title": "Frankie Dettori will NOT make comeback at Royal Ascot 2024 as speculation ended", "text": "Frankie Dettori will NOT ride at Royal Ascot later this month, it has been confirmed. Speculation was mounting that the Italian, who shelved retirement plans to continue his career in the USA last autumn, could take some rides at the five-day royal meeting which starts on June 18. But Hannah Tufnell, of H Talent Management, which represents the jockey, said. \u201cFrankie is going as a racegoer. \"He made the decision to retire from British racing last October, and he is going to honour that.\" She told the Racing Post: \"He will be enjoying some quality time with family and friends, having his first experience of the meeting out of the saddle.\" Dettori will be in attendance at the royal fixture to fulfil his role in a hospitality venture with compatriot and celebrated chef Francesco Mazzei. There had been speculation that US trainer Wesley Ward could give him the leg-up on some of his runners nut that has now ended. Dettori has made a big success of his move to the States. In April he rode six consecutive winners at Santa Anita in California on one Saturday evening. The victories came at cumulative odds of more than 77,000-1. Dettori famously rode a 'Magnificent Seven' of all winners on the card at Ascot in September 1996 at odds of over 25,000-1.", "summary": "The 53-year-old Italian has ended speculation that he could ride at the meeting where he has ridden 81 winners", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/frankie-dettori-not-make-comeback-32992965", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32267158.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Newgate-Dettori-Lanfranco-1-200.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:41:33", "author": "Jason Heavey,Jason-Heavey", "authors": ["Jason Heavey", "Jason-Heavey"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.441}

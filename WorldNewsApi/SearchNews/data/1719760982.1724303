{"id": 225038776, "title": "What are leaking underground storage tanks and how are they being cleaned up?", "text": "HOW LEAKS HAPPEN Environmental experts say even a pinprick-size hole in an underground tank can send 400 gallons of fuel a year into the ground, polluting soil and water. Spills can also destroy habitat and kill wildlife. Roughly 81 million people live within a quarter-mile of an underground storage tank that\u2019s experienced at least one leak, based on the latest EPA data. Most tanks were made of steel in the mid-1980s and likely to corrode over time. Modern tanks are fiberglass, which is more resistant to corrosion, but all tanks begin to leak sooner or later, said Dr. Kelly Pennell, a professor of environmental engineering and water resources at the University of Kentucky. The cylindrical tanks typically hold tens of thousands of gallons of fuel. Detecting leaks is not easy, she said. \u201cIf a gasoline station operated for 10 or 15 years, you may not be able to detect those small leaks,\u201d said Dr. Pennell. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be losing 1,000 gallons a day \u2014 you\u2019re losing drips \u2014 but over time those matter.\u201d Leaks can form chemical plumes that move through groundwater and turn into vapor that rises up through cracks in the foundations of homes and businesses. Those fumes can contain cancer-causing chemicals including benzene, an ingredient in gasoline. And they carry a risk of fire and explosion. When contamination was found in Canob Park, the local fire chief sampled drinking water at one of the service stations and said it was \u201calmost ignitable.\u201d", "summary": "For more than a decade, some residents of the tiny Richmond, Rhode Island, neighborhood of Canob Park drank and bathed using tap water that had been tainted by gasoline that leaked from storage tanks buried under service stations a few hundred yards from their homes. They spent years battling oil companies, dealing with the daily [&#8230;]", "url": "https://nationalpost.com/pmn/health-pmn/what-are-leaking-underground-storage-tanks-and-how-are-they-being-cleaned-up", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nationalpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cli301-the-associated-press-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:43:17", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.146}

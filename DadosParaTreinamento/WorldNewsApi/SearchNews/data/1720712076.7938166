{"id": 231931166, "title": "My family nominated Dad for the Order of Australia before he died. Today he becomes a member", "text": "The foundational fact of my father\u2019s life is that he was born to two Polish Holocaust survivors in a displaced persons camp in Germany in 1947, and came to Australia in 1950 as a stateless child refugee. He often said, with a touch of grim humour, that his parents had one stroke of good fortune in their lives, and that was ending up in Australia. He was right. Working on the draft of Dad\u2019s nomination, I read through his speeches, delivered at his children\u2019s bar and bat mitzvahs, graduations, weddings, and finally at his retirement party in 2022. Several themes recur \u2013 his love of Judaism, his family, Jane Austen and the Pies \u2013 but always, underlying it all, was gratitude for the place my grandparents called the goldene medina, the golden land. Dad wasn\u2019t a patriot in the cloying, flag-waving sense, but he loved Australia for giving him what every human being deserves: security, stability, a decent public education, meaningful work. He spoke only Yiddish when he started school, but that didn\u2019t matter in Melbourne\u2019s inner north in the \u201950s, where thousands of \u201cNew Australians\u201d \u2013 as they were quaintly called \u2013 had poured in from the bleeding gash of Europe. In Dad\u2019s rose-tinted recollection of his youth, he experienced no discrimination or antisemitism in Australia, something I somehow both believe and don\u2019t. Maybe it was just that he didn\u2019t consciously register the microaggressions, which would have been overshadowed by the horrors his parents endured. Or maybe Melbourne in the \u201960s and \u201970s was a simpler place, buoyed by a rush of immigration and postwar prosperity, the demons of history still decades away from catching up with us. Probably a bit of both.", "summary": "Dad worked in hospitals for over 40 years and led a cardiothoracic unit for seven years, but he was humble about his achievements to the point of obfuscation.", "url": "https://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/my-family-nominated-dad-for-the-order-of-australia-before-he-died-today-he-becomes-a-member-20240609-p5jkdk.html", "image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7277%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_151/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/4e28cd78b3b12c9a3d4671f03f73c90c5e6b07cb", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:00:00", "author": "Elissa Goldstein", "authors": ["Elissa Goldstein"], "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": 0.14}

Princess Anne, 73, suffered a concussion and minor head injuries at Gatcombe Park in south-western England on Sunday evening, and was taken to hospital in Bristol. It is believed she was struck by a horse as she was walking within the protected perimeter of the sprawling estate, which often hosts equestrian events. At the time, her medical team said her injuries were consistent with a potential impact from a horse\u2019s head or legs. The Princess Royal, as she is also known, is a skilled rider who competed at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, and has a reputation as the hardest-working royal. She has stepped in to represent King Charles while he postponed public engagements during his cancer treatment, and rode at his official birthday parade earlier this month. But the accident forced her to withdraw from an appearance at a state banquet on Tuesday evening for visiting Japanese Emperor Naruhito, and cancel an upcoming trip to Canada. Her husband Tim Laurence was seen earlier in the week leaving Southmead Hospital in Bristol after visiting his wife. He thanked the medical team at Southmead Hospital \u201cfor their care, expertise and kindness during my wife\u2019s short stay\u201d. Buckingham Palace said on Monday that Anne was in hospital \u201cas a precautionary measure for observation and was expected to make a full and swift recovery\u201d. \u2013 AFP", "summary": "<p class=\"lead\">LONDON \u2013 Princess Anne, the sister of Britain\u2019s King Charles III, has been discharged from hospital after she required treatment from being struck by a horse at her country estate.</p>\n\n<p>Princess Anne, 73, suffered a concussion and...", "url": "https://tnp.straitstimes.com/news/world/british-royal-princess-anne-leaves-hospital-after-horse-accident", "image": "https://tnp.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/rl680/public/FILES-BRITAIN-ROYALS-ANNE-120740.jpg?itok=r0mqwT-K", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:55:30", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "sg", "sentiment": 0.153}

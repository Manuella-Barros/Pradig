{"id": 232012580, "title": "Padres Daily: Built around Manny, but also built up around him; Merrill never stops; Kim's power surge", "text": "Good morning, How far the Padres go this season is still largely a matter of how far Manny Machado takes them. He will be in the heart of their order virtually every night once he returns from his hip flexor strain, which will likely happen in the next couple days. He will come to bat in big situation after big situation. He sets a tone. But the Padres have never been equipped to make up for bad days by Machado or for there being no Machado like they are this season. Last night was the second game in a row and 16th time in 68 games this season that all nine batters in the Padres\u2019 starting lineup reached base at least once. It had happened seven times to this point last season. Machado did not play the past two nights, has missed seven games this season and is batting .248 with a .685 OPS. That is the lowest OPS he has ever had 61 games into a season. Yet the Padres are 34-34, have the best team batting average in the major leagues, the eighth-highest OPS and have scored the eighth-most runs. They also sit in the National League\u2019s second wild-card spot. \u201cThis whole team, it's a long season, it's a lot of ups and downs,\u201d Machado said this week. \u201c\u2026 Everyone is going to have to pick up the slack.\u201d What happened the past two games and has happened much of the season is pretty much just that. Again, Machado Lite or Machadoless are not recipes for ultimate success. But this is a vast improvement over last season, when the Padres essentially went as the Big Four went. They were down to a Big One (Fernando Tatis Jr.) the past two games and scored 23 runs. Would it be better if Xander Bogaerts, Machado and Tatis had been performing at their career norms all season? Yes. I wrote (here) recently about how the trio around which the team was built has greatly underperformed, especially relative to the \u201cBig Threes\u201d of other teams such as the Dodgers, Yankees and Phillies. That story also talked about how well the Padres\u2019 supporting cast has performed. The bottom four batters in the Padres\u2019 order last night went 8-for-15. It was the 19th time the bottom four spots in their order have accounted for at least five hits, and the Padres are 15-4 in those games. That is seven more times than the bottom four spots in the Dodgers\u2019 order has gotten at least five hits and six more times than the Yankees\u2019 bottom four has gotten at least five hits. Again \u2014 because it can\u2019t be said enough \u2014 Machado getting back to being a dominant force is paramount. However, the last two nights are not the first examples of the 2024 Padres being a different kind of team. You can read Jeff Sanders' game preview (here) from yesterday for an update on Machado's recovery. The offense was again the focus of my game story (here) from last night\u2019s 13-1 victory over the Diamondbacks. The Padres continued to do what they did Friday (and what was discussed in yesterday\u2019s newsletter) by combining their ability to hit with a renewed ability to slug. This isn\u2019t entirely new. In their first 37 games (through May 5), the Padres\u2019 .412 slugging percentage was tied for fourth in the majors and their 40 home runs were sixth most. In 29 games over the next month (from May 6 through Thursday), they hit 20 home runs (second fewest) and had a .362 slugging percentage (fifth lowest). The slug struggle was particularly acute in the 18 games leading up to Friday, when they hit just nine home runs. They have six homers (along with seven doubles) in the past two nights. \u201cWe were still getting our hits; we weren't doing damage,\u201d manager Mike Shildt said last night. \u201cNow we're back to that spot where we're doing damage and still getting our hits and using the whole field. So clearly, it's a good brand of baseball.\u201d The Padres scored four runs in three different innings last night. In the process, they retook the lead for most innings scoring four or more runs this season, with 24. I cite this statistic so often because it illustrates how much better they are at stringing together hits and creating runs this season. Last year, they did not have their 24th inning with four or more runs until Sept. 11, the 145th game of the season. The Padres were winning by 12 runs. They had subbed out as many of their starting position players as their bench allowed. Diamondbacks outfielder Pavin Smith had pitched the bottom of the eighth. And when Eugenio Su\u00e1rez lined a ball to the gap in left field with one out in the ninth inning, Jackson Merrill ran more than 80 feet to make a diving catch. \u201cWho cares?\u201d Merrill said of the score. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to Su\u00e1rez, because anybody needs that hit. But I don't think anybody should stop playing the game hard. I don\u2019t think there's an excuse to give up on a ball if we\u2019re up by 10 or down by 10.\u201d It was the latest example of why I wrote (here) last month that it is as if Merrill was designed in a lab to Shildt\u2019s specifications. \u201cIt's not a completely close game, and he's playing it regardless of circumstance,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cAnd that's what a winning player does \u2026 That's what really exceptional players do. They're always on point. And Jackson is always on point. He's a great competitor.\u201d Merrill has sort of flown under the radar much of the past six weeks after making highly impactful, impossible-to-overlook contributions so often early in the season. There have been moments he has appeared to be well beyond his experience level and others that he seems like the rookie he is. He was batting .196/.196/.196 over his previous 14 games before starting on his current four-game hit streak, during which he is 5-for-15 with three doubles and a walk. \u201cIt's really developed into an easier piece,\u201d Merrill said last night after hitting two doubles. \u201cYou get to the big leagues, you put a little more thought into it than you need to. I\u2019ve learned a lot in the last couple of weeks.\u201d Ha-Seong Kim said on the first day of June, after hitting a double and a triple in a victory in Kansas City, that he felt like he would heat up with the summer. After homering for the second straight game last night, he is batting .276 (8-for-29) with three doubles, a triple and the two homers this month. \u201cTo be honest, if I'd had a little bit more luck with some of my in-play balls this season, I would say that I am a better hitter,\u201d Kim said last night through interpreter David Lee. \u201cBut it's early in the season. So there's a lot more games to go. I always have that mentality to improve in any aspect every year. So I think by the end of the season, I can tell you that I'm confident that I will be a better hitter than I was last year.\u201d Kim\u2019s batting average on balls in play is .237 this season, 73 points lower than in 2023. His batting average (.224) is 36 points off last year's pace. And despite having added substantial muscle, in part with the aim of increased power, he had not until recently been on pace to even match last year\u2019s home run total of 17. But he has now homered three times in 35 at-bats and has nine on the season. His 40 percent hard-hit rate over the past 10 games leads the team and is almost double his rate before that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can hit a home run whenever I want to,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to get on the barrel to increase the chances of that. I haven\u2019t really been able to do that since the beginning of the season, but I\u2019m feeling I\u2019m starting to get better, and hopefully this momentum carries on.\u201d The only trouble Matt Waldron had last night was in the fifth inning, after the Padres had sent eight batters to the plate and scored four runs over the course of nearly a half-hour in the bottom of the fourth. \u201cIt was great for the first 10 or 15 (minutes),\u201d Waldron said. \u201cThen it's like, \u2018Alright, come on, guys.\u2019\u201d Up 8-0 when he took the mound in the fifth, Waldron yielded a double, a single and a walk to load the bases and then another single to bring in a run. A pop out, fielder\u2019s choice play at home and a groundout got him out of the inning. \u201cI think there was a little bit of just maybe a little anxiousness,\u201d Waldron said. \u201cBut you get rolling and get your body ready to go, and you look up at the scoreboard and you know you can withhold a couple grand slams.\u201d There was also a mound visit by pitching coach Ruben Niebla after the walk that loaded the bases. Niebla provided encouragement, a refresher and a reality check. \u201cIt was pretty much like going through the game plan of what we're going to do to (the batter) but also, you know, one more hit, two more hits and you're out of the game,\u201d Waldron recalled. \u201cWhich is great. I like to know what they're talking about. \u2026 That made me more hungry.\u201d Tatis was 1-for-4 with a double and a walk last night to extend his hit streak to 14 games, tied for the longest of his career. He is batting .421 (24-for-57) with a 1.117 OPS during the streak. Kyle Higashioka\u2019s response last Sunday when asked about breaking his 0-for-22 skid with a single and a home run was to remember going 0-for-22 at the start of his career before hitting homers for his first three big-league hits. He has a knack for knocks after skids. Higashioka was 2-for-4 with a single and a home run last night and is 5-for-14 with three home runs since Sunday. Padres starting pitchers have a 2.09 ERA and 0.81 WHIP over their past six starts, the lowest marks in the majors in that span. Donovan Solano\u2019s single at the end of an eight-pitch at-bat leading off the second inning led to his scoring the first run of the night. It was Solano\u2019s 15th hit with two strikes. His .395 batting average (15-for-38) with two strikes is best in the majors among anyone with more than 12 such at-bats. He ended up scoring the first run last night.David Peralta had his second three-hit game in his nine starts for the Padres. Last night, he was 3-for-3 with two doubles and two walks. He scored twice and drove in two runs.The Diamondbacks might maneuver their rotation so Ryne Nelson does not face the Padres whenever possible. He allowed six runs in 3\u2153 innings last night. Since making his MLB debut against the Padres on Sept 5, 2022, and throwing seven scoreless innings that night, Nelson has an 8.78 ERA in six starts against them. Luis Arraez was 2-for-6 and moved into a tie with Kansas City\u2019s Bobby Witt Jr. for the most multi-hit games in the majors with 27. Arraez, who leads MLB with a .337 batting average, has 15 multi-hit games in his 30 starts with the Padres.Jake Cronenworth was 2-for-5 with a home run last night. The homer was his ninth of the season but first in 78 at-bats.All right, that\u2019s it for me. There will be no newsletter in your inbox tomorrow. I am taking today off to celebrate an important person's fourth birthday. Jeff Sanders will have the rest of our usual coverage on our Padres page.

Dermot O'Leary: Soccer Aid has 'something for everyone' \"There\u2019s something for everyone with Soccer Aid for UNICEF. You have entertainment, usually a few mishaps but also incredible skill and great stories but at its core is the charity and the cause that we\u2019re all raising money for. \"It\u2019s always such an amazing show, it feels electric in the stadium and it\u2019s of course about the football, but it\u2019s also about more than that. \"The moments in time are pretty special. All the players (and myself) losing it over meeting Pele is definitely up there.\" Alex Scott: Soccer Aid will be 'epic as always' \"It really is special! The fact that so many people come together and have a good time, but on the day, we all know what it goes towards - I\u2019ve seen it first hand. \"It\u2019s incredible to be part of something that will help vulnerable kids all over the world. It's going to be epic as always this year! \"I remember a really touching moment when David Harewood did a speech on the day, the lights went down in the stadium and all the fans shone their phone torches, it was a real goosebump moment. On the complete other side of the spectrum, It was hilarious when we did The Masked Winger and it turned out to be Stephen Mulhern.\" How to watch Soccer Aid 2024 on TV TV schedules for June 9 had not been released at the time of writing but in previous years the game has started at around 7.30pm.", "summary": "A host of stars and football legends will line up for England and Soccer Aid World XI at Stamford Bridge", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/who-soccer-aid-2024-presenters-29260024", "image": "https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article28846029.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1497722554.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:30:00", "author": "Lorna Hughes", "authors": ["Lorna Hughes"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.575}

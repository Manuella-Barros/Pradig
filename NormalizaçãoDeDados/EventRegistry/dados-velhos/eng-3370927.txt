It's like a main street with a lot of shops and people,\" Muguruza said.\n\n\"I was very surprised because you always hear what happened in Paris and in London, and you're, like, 'Shit.' But now, I've been so many times to this place, it's like my home. And I feel, like, 'Shit.'\n\n\"I've been there so many times. So it really shocked me. Really shocked me.\n\n\"I'm just sad for the people that were there. I feel like if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, it can happen anywhere.\"\n\nOnce Muguruza learned of the attack, she called to make certain her family was unharmed.\n\n\"During the rain delay. I'm like OK, I was listening to music, I checked for news and stuff, and I'm like, 'Oh,'\" Muguruza said. \"I checked with my family. Everything is OK, but, you know, it's just incredible.\"\n\n- Emotional shock -\n\nMuguruza said she was able to set aside the emotional shock and return to finish her match, deadlocked 2-2 in the third set when the storm struck.\n\nShe saved three match points before breaking in the 12th game, then led all the way in the tie-breaker.\n\n\"I'm used to putting so many things aside to be able to compete. That's my every day, putting things aside and going out there and have two hours of concentration of tennis,\" Muguruza said.\n\n\"I just make sure that people around me are fine. There is not a lot I can do anymore. Just support the people. Be with them. But at the end I've got to go play. And after, we can talk again. But I have to kind of block it for two hours.\"\n\nDavid Ferrer, who also advanced to the quarter-finals, tweeted after his match: \"All my solidarity with the people affected in the attack of Barcelona .. Very sad all that is happening.\"\n\nAnd Ramos-Vinolas tweeted ahead of his meeting with Nadal: \"Great pain when seeing what is happening in #Barcelona. A part of me is today with you.

I have been so many times to that place, so many times,\" Muguruza said of the attack on the popular Las Ramblas district in Barcelona. \"You know, it's like a main street with a lot of shops and people. I was very surprised, you know, because you always hear what happened in Paris and in London, and you're, like, s--t. But now, I have been so many times to this place, it's like my home. And I feel, like, s--t, I have been there so many times. So it really shocked me. Really shocked me.\n\n\"I'm just sad for the people that were there. I feel like if you're in the wrong moment at the wrong time, it can happen anywhere.\"\n\nThe news came to Muguruza, the defending Wimbledon women's single champ and No. 4-seeded player at the Western & Southern, in the midst of a roughly two-hour delay.\n\nShe would eventually be forced to return to her match, a tightly contested battle against the Western & Southern No. 16-seeded American, Madison Keys.\n\nComplicating matters was that play was halted at a critical moment in the match, with the third set deadlocked at 2-2.\n\nHowever understandable it would have been for Muguruza to want to devote her full attention to the city she once called home during the delay, her profession doesn't allow for such distractions.\n\nShe called to ensure her family in Barcelona was safe, and they were, she said.\n\nHaving achieved a kind of reassurance about the situation unfolding an ocean away, she switched off the personal side of her world.\n\n\"I'm used to (putting) so many things aside to be able to compete,\" she said. \"That's my every day, you know, putting things aside and going out there and have two hours of concentration of tennis. I just make sure that people around me are fine. There is not a lot I can do anymore. Just support the people. Be, you know, with them. But at the end, I've got to go play. And after, we can talk again. But I have to kind of block it for two hours.\"\n\nMuguruza's mental fortitude shone brightly in the moment as she returned from the rain delay and defeated Keys (6-4, 3-6, 7-6) in a third-set tiebreak to advance to Friday's quarterfinal round.\n\nThe Western & Southern Open is a truly international melting pot, both in the courts and in the grandstands, so it was only natural for news of Thursday's terrorist attack to reverberate around the grounds of the Lindner Family Tennis Center.\n\nA white van slammed into crowds on a crowded pedestrian mall Thursday in the Las Ramblas district, killing at least 12 people and injuring 80 in what Spanish police called a terror attack.\n\nIn Greater Cincinnati, several Spanish tennis players participating in the Western & Southern took to social media to discuss the attack.\n\nSix Spaniards - Rafael Nadal, Albert Ramos-Vinolas, Pablo Carreno Busta, David Ferrer, and Muguruza and Carla Suarez Navarro - were still vying for the men's and women's singles titles when Thursday's matches at the Western & Southern began at 11 a.m.\n\nNadal, who won his second-round match Wednesday and will be the No. 1 ranked men's player in the world by week's end, issued a statement from his @RafaelNadal Twitter account.\n\nAccording to a translation of the text, Nadal's message stated: \"Shattered by what has happened in Barcelona! All my support to affected families and the city.\"\n\nNadal was scheduled to play fellow Spaniard and Barcelona native Albert Ramos-Vinolas Thursday night on Center Court.\n\nThursday featured a second all-Spanish men's singles third-round matchup. David Ferrer, of Valencia, Spain, defeated Pablo Carreno Busta.\n\nCarreno Busta was born in Gijon, Spain but currently, resides in Barcelona.\n\nFollowing his win over Carreno Busta (6-4 6-4), Ferrer sent two tweets regarding the terror attack.\n\nThe first message stated, \"All my sympathy to those affected in the Barcelona attack. Very sad what is happening,\" according to a translation.\n\nThe second tweet was an illustration of the city of Barcelona adorned with a black ribbon.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "id":

Muguruza dominated from there, winning the tiebreak 7-3 to take the match 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(3) and earn her first win against the rising American star.\n\nBeyond the actual tennis that was played, the match had its share of drama: Right after Keys equalized the third-set score at 2-all, play was suspended for about two hours as a storm passed through Mason, bringing torrential downpour and bursts of thunder and lighting. Even before the onset of the storm, heavy winds made serving difficult for both players.\n\n\"It was kind of two different matches smashed together,\" Keys said about the two-hour rain delay's effect on the match.\n\nBoth also took medical timeouts prior to the rain, Muguruza in the first set and Keys between the second and third ones.\n\nKeys held a 3-0 head-to-head advantage over, and had only dropped a single set to, Muguruza going into today's match. Their most recent meeting came less than two weeks ago, when Keys beat Muguruza in straight sets in the semifinals of the Bank of the West Classic.\n\n\"I was ready for a difficult match,\" Muguruza said about today's meeting. \"I had played her before. It was a completely different situation at Stanford. I felt here more prepared to play (today)... I came just ready for what happened and (to) fight.\"\n\nKeys and Muguruza broke each other twice each in the first five games of the opening set. After Keys won four straight points to earn a 4-3 lead, Muguruza left the court in between games for a medical timeout. She returned and didn't look back, going on to win the next three games and take the set, 6-4.\n\nKeys fought back in the second, holding her serve throughout. She faced a 40-15 deficit in the second set's third game but chipped away to force the first of six deuces. She saved a third break point, but it wasn't until her fifth advantage (?wording?) that she won the game.\n\nLater, Muguruza had game point down 3-4, but Keys won five of the next six points -- breaking Muguruza and taking the next game to force a third set.\n\nAfter play was suspended, Keys came out roaring, breaking Muguruza and holding her serve to jump ahead, 4-2. A rally from Muguruza gave her a 5-4 lead, but Keys didn't drop a point in the following game, evening the score.\n\n\"I think she played amazingly well at the end,\" Keys said about her opponent's performance. \"She really didn't give me any unforced errors or anything like that. I obviously had some unforced errors that I wasn't happy about but I felt like I had to go for it because she was just going to make everything.\"\n\nMuguruza holds a 4-1 lifetime record over her next opponent, Svetlana Kuznetsova, whom she will play in the quarterfinals tomorrow. In between now and then, though, she will take time to process today's terror attack in Barcelona, a place she has close ties to. Muguruza, who is Spanish-Venezuelan but represents Spain, found out about the attacks during the rain delay.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it... I was very surprised. You always hear what happened in Paris and in London and you're like, 'shit.' But now, I've been so many times to this place, it's like my home. I feel like, 'shit,'\" Muguruza said. \"So it really shocked me. Really shocked me. Just sad for the people that were there. I feel like if you're in the wrong moment at the wrong time, it can happen anywhere.\"\n\nAfter checking to make sure her loved ones were all alright, Muguruza had to put her emotions aside for the time being to stay mentally sharp for the rest of the match.\n\n\"I'm used to putting so many things aside to be able to compete,\" Muguruza said. \"(I do that) everyday, putting things aside and going out there and having two hours of concentration on tennis. I've just made sure people that around me are fine. There's nothing I can do anymore, just support the people, be with them, but at the end I got to go play and after we can talk again. But I have to block it for two hours.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "id": "9804356", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Muguruza outlasts rain, Keys' comeback to win in third-set tiebreaker", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "113913", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "151106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tennis"}, "id": "302857", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "id": "303240", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}, "id": "303577", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}, "id": "304427", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}, "id": "306682", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm"}, {"label": {"eng": "Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza"}, "id": "310203", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbi\u00f1e_Muguruza"}, {"label": {"eng": "Svetlana Kuznetsova"}, "id": "310885", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svetlana_Kuznetsova"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glossary of tennis terms"}, "id": "323035", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_tennis_terms"}, {"label": {"eng": "Madison Keys"}, "id": "337721", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Keys"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}, "id": "379435", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rainout (sports)"}, "id": "389666", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainout_(sports)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stanford Classic"}, "id": "964570", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Classic"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 116, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations and Age Groups", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations_and_Age_Groups"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 137, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 956, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying"}], "time": "01:18:00"}

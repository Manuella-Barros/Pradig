Strasbourg does not impose on member states any obligation to recognise same sex marriage. I hereby dismiss this application for judicial review.\"\n\nThree couples challenged the current law with a two-pronged legal process.\n\nAn annonymous couple known as Petition X wanted their marriage in England recognised in Northern Ireland instead of having it downgraded to civil parternship.\n\nAnd Gr\u00e1inne Close and Shannon Sickles, and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane took the second part of the challenge.\n\nThey had argued Northern Ireland's ban on same sex marriage breached their human rights and wanted a judicial review.\n\nThe first challenge was dismissed by Mr Justice O'Hara at 2.21pm.\n\nHe dismissed the second at 2.29pm.\n\nThe judge told the court: \"It is not at all difficult to understand how gay men and lesbians who have suffered discrimination, rejection and exclusion feel so strongly about the maintenance in Northern Ireland of the barrier to same sex marriage. However, the judgment which I have to reach is not based on social policy but on the law.\"\n\nThe first challenge referred to a couple who were married in England in 2014, but their move to Northern Ireland ensured the status of their marriage was downgraded to civil partnership.\n\nThe men, referred to as Petition X, remained anonymous throughout the case as they attempted to have their marital status recognised in Northern Ireland.\n\nTheir solicitor, Ciaran Moynagh, had said a successful challenge would result in the first recognition of a same sex marriage in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt did not.\n\nThe judge held that on the basis of the case law from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg he could not conclude that Petition X's Convention rights have been violated.\n\nHe said: \"While the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission supports an equal level of human rights protection across the United Kingdom, its Chief Commissioner wrote on 11 June 2012 that 'the restriction of marriage to opposite sex couples does not violate the international standards and this is clear from both the international treaties and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the United Nations Human Rights Committee.' In my view the Chief Commissioner was correct to make that statement.\n\nHe added that the House of Lords declared that an unmarried couple could be considered as adoptive parents for a child despite a specific statutory provision that only married couples could so be considered.\n\nThe result of the second part of the challenge was delivered at the High Court in Belfast, 2.39pm.\n\nGr\u00e1inne Close and Shannon Sickles and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane heard the result of the consideration of the Mr Justice O'Hara.\n\nHe said: \"That judgment was heavily influenced by the conclusion that the Strasbourg Court which had previously taken a contrary view would no longer do so.\n\n\"There is simply no reason in this case to believe that the Strasbourg Court will take a different view in the foreseeable future in light of its clear, repeated and recent rulings.\n\nIn the first case of its kind, Gr\u00e1inne and Shannon, and Chris and Henry, had argued Northern Ireland's ban on same sex marriage breached their human rights.\n\nBrought through the High Court, thy challenged the current law which states same-sex marriages entered into in England and Wales must be downgraded to civil-partnerships in Northern Ireland ensuring that the state of same-sex marriage cannot exist here.\n\nThe legal process, established in 2013, followed negotiations between the British government and the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nThe successful overturning this rule would mean same sex marriages are recognised in Northern Ireland for the first time.\n\nBoth cases had been under consideration for almost two years by Mr Justice O'Hara were are being dealt with at the same time because of the close nature of the issues.\n\nThe judgement was expected at 2pm and it grew closer #marriageequaility started trending on social media with all eyes on Northern Ireland.\n\nShannon Sickles and Grainne Close were the first women to have a civil partnership in Northern Ireland.\n\nAnd Christopher and Henry Flanagan-Kane were the first men have a civil partnership here.\n\nThey became the first and second couples in the UK to enter into a civil partnership after Northern Ireland became the first part of the UK to make that option available in December 2005.\n\nThey took a case against Stormont's Department of Finance and Personnel, which regulates the country's marriage laws.\n\nTheir claim through the court was that the prohibition on marriage contravened their right to marriage and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Attorney General John Larkin also argued against the legal challenge.\n\nThe two couples broke legal ground by becoming the first to enter a same-sex civil union in the UK in 2005.\n\nUsing the process of judicial review, they have challenged the Stormont Assembly's repeated refusal to legislate for same sex marriage.\n\nMr Moynagh said: \"This couple took their vows because they believe in the traditional values associated with marriage. They see it as the ultimate sign of commitment and best foundation for a family. That's why having it downgraded to a civil partnership has been so distressing.\"\n\nMs Sickles said the case she and Ms Close are taking with the Flanagan-Kanes is \"distinct\" from the anonymised petition.\n\nShe explained: \"Our case is distinct in that winning this is about bringing same-sex marriage to all couples in Northern Ireland.\n\nNo deal to get Stormont back up and running\n\n\"We're looking for same-sex couples to be able to get married in Northern Ireland, not for specifically for a marriage which happened in another jurisdiction to be recognised.\"", "id": "9717709", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Same sex marriage legal challenge dismissed", "image": "http://i4.belfastlive.co.uk/incoming/article13490976.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/170817JP2GayMarriage001.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2468, "date": "2012-06-11", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2480}, {"textStart": 4947, "date": "2005-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4960}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "91866", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Strasbourg"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "114608", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg", "label": {"eng": "Strasbourg"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human rights"}, "id": "302584", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}, "id": "304310", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marriage"}, "id": "304555", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Precedent"}, "id": "305823", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent"}, {"label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}, "id": "306056", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage"}, {"label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "id": "313403", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Court of Human Rights"}, "id": "315550", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Convention on Human Rights"}, "id": "317369", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "Judicial review"}, "id": "325399", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review"}, {"label": {"eng": "Civil union"}, "id": "343415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "House of Lords"}, "id": "349956", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords"}, {"label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland Assembly"}, "id": "375840", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly"}, {"label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission"}, "id": "1010957", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Human_Rights_Commission"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 42, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 233, "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality"}], "time": "15:09:00"}

action in a bid to have the ban lifted.\n\nIn 2005 they became the first couples in the United Kingdom to enter civil partnerships, cementing their relationships in ceremonies at Belfast City Hall.\n\nBut unlike the rest of the UK and the Republic, Northern Ireland has still not legalised same-sex marriage.\n\nStormont MLAs have voted five times on the issue - with a narrow majority in favour of the move on the last occasion in November 2015.\n\nHowever, the DUP deployed a petition of concern mechanism to block the motion and prevent any change in the law.\n\nLawyers representing the two couples claimed they are suffering state discrimination after being marginalised all their lives.\n\nThey argued that the repeated refusal to legislation breaches their entitlement to family life and marriage under the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nIn proceedings issued against the Department of Finance and Personnel, Northern Ireland was described as \"a blot on the map\" seen by the rest of the world as backward-looking and divided.\n\nBeing relegated to the second-class status of civil partnerships is demeaning and offensive to the couples' unions, it was contended.\n\nAccording to their case the ban is having a \"corrosive\" impact on society.\n\nCounsel for the Stormont department under challenge insisted the two couples have suffered no grave breach of their human rights.\n\nHe also denied there has been any \"legislative inertia\" on the issue.\n\nDelivering judgment in front of a packed courtroom, Mr Justice O'Hara acknowledged the \"compelling evidence\" of how the gay and lesbian community has long suffered less favourable treatment.\n\nHe cited the insults, psychiatric damage and exclusion endured by its members.\n\nBut the judge stressed that the challenge was going against all recent European case law.\n\n\"If there's a move it's undoubtedly towards recognition of same-sex marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, from the applicants' perspective, there's no sign of the Strasbourg court moving in that direction.\"\n\nThe legal challenge does not fall into the limited category of circumstances warranting judicial intervention, he held.\n\nMr Justice O'Hara added: \"Put simply, the Strasbourg court has not recognised any right to same-sex marriage.\"\n\nWith any bid to achieve such status now resting with Stormont, he concluded by saying: \"I hope when the Assembly next sits to consider this issue those with the responsibility of voting will read the evidence in this case.\"\n\nLawyers for X and his husband claimed their rights to privacy and family life, religious freedom and entitlement to marry under the European Convention on Human Rights have all been violated.\n\nThey insisted the case differed from the separate legal bid to have the same-sex marriage laws extended to Northern Ireland.\n\nDowngrading a marriage validly recognised in England, Wales and Scotland to civil partnership status in Northern Ireland amounts to an unlawful interference, it was argued.\n\nX and his husband were able to wed in England following the introduction of the Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Act 2013.\n\nBut counsel for UK's Government Equality Office (GEO) countered that there was never intended to be a \"one size fits all\" approach to the issue across the regions.\n\nHe insisted that a gay couple's ability to get married in England and Wales was a matter of policy rather than a legal obligation.\n\nBacking those submissions, Mr Justice O'Hara said: \"The judgment I have to reach is not based on social policy, but on the law.\"\n\nDismissing the case, he concluded: \"X's rights have not been violated by virtue of the fact that same-sex marriage he entered into in London in 2014 is recognised in Northern Ireland only as a civil partnership.\"", "id": "9801376", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Judge rejects same-sex marriage challenges", "image":

Keep Demanding Change! #bproud2017 https://t.co/lertnMhlpg -- Belfast Pride (@belfastpride)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nThe judge said he understood why gay men and lesbians felt frustrated about the prohibition, especially given the fact a majority of Stormont Assembly members supported a law change at the last vote, but he insisted his job was to interpret the law as it stood, not decide social policy.\n\nThe judgments came amid a long-running political dispute on the ban. A majority of MLAs backed a law change the last time the issue came to the floor of Stormont, but the socially conservative Democratic Unionists triggered a contentious voting mechanism to effectively block the measure.\n\nPowersharing has since collapsed and the gay marriage issue is one of the sticking points preventing its restoration return, with Sinn Fein demanding the DUP stop standing in the way of a change.\n\nThe DUP insists it is protecting the \"traditional\" definition of marriage.\n\nDelivering judgment at Belfast High Court, Mr Justice O'Hara said: \"It is not at all difficult to understand how gay men and lesbians who have suffered discrimination, rejection and exclusion feel so strongly about the maintenance in Northern Ireland of the barrier to same sex marriage.\n\n\"However, the judgment which I have to reach is not based on social policy but on the law.\"\n\nThe judge heard the two cases together due to the similarities of the legal arguments.\n\nThe first challenge - known as Petition X due an anonymity order - involved two men who married in London in 2014 and were attempting to get their union recognised in Northern Ireland.\n\nTheir marriage was changed to a civil partnership in law when they moved to Northern Ireland.\n\nIn the second case, two couples in civil partnerships - Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane - argued the same sex marriage prohibition breaches their human rights.\n\nBoth couples were, respectively, the first and second in the UK to enter into a civil partnership after Northern Ireland became the first part of the UK to make that option available in December 2005.\n\n\"We have families and our children are being treated differently because of today's result.\"\n\nHer partner Ms Sickles vowed to appeal against the judgment and urged supporters to contribute to a fighting fund to sustain the legal campaign.\n\n\"This is a long term, many years ahead appeal process to bring human rights to all citizens in Northern Ireland,\" she said.\n\nAsked for his reaction, Chris Flanagan-Kane unfurled a rainbow flag from his pocket and vowed to challenge the outcome.\n\nThe couple in the X petition case issued a statement expressing their disappointment.\n\n\"What it shows is that more work needs to be done to explain a truth that, to us, is self-evident - the love two men or two women share is never a threat to society, in fact the world could do with a little more love today,\" they said.\n\n\"Today we are calling on the mums, dads, siblings and friends of LGBT+ people to no longer remain on the side lines.

men and lesbians who have suffered discrimination, rejection and exclusion feel so strongly about the maintenance in Northern Ireland of the barrier to same sex marriage.\n\n\"However, the judgment which I have to reach is not based on social policy but on the law.\"\n\nSame-sex marriage is legal in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland, but is banned in Northern Ireland.\n\nShannon Sickles, Grainne Close, and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane were challenging Stormont's refusal to legislate for same-sex marriage.\n\n\"We have families and our children are being treated differently because of today's result.\"\n\nHer partner, Ms Sickles, said they would continue their legal challenge.\n\nTimeline of same-sex marriage:\n\nTwelve years ago, Northern Ireland was the first place in the UK to introduce civil partnerships.\n\nMs Sickles and Ms Close made history on 19 December 2005 when their relationship was legally recognised in the UK's first civil partnership ceremony at Belfast City Hall.\n\nThey were closely followed by Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane, whose civil partnership took place later that same day.\n\nDuring the joint challenge to the law in Northern Ireland, the couple's lawyers argued that the ban breaches Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights, by denying respect for their private and family lives.\n\nBut a lawyer for Stormont's Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) countered that the ban was not a breach of human rights and that civil partnerships already met the minimum requirements set out under human rights law.\n\nThe couple who married in England had been granted anonymity, and their case was referred to as Petition X.\n\nThe campaign for same-sex marriage has been highly divisive at the Northern Ireland Assembly in recent years, and is currently in Stormont's continuing political crisis.\n\nAssembly members (MLAs) have voted five times on whether or not to introduce same-sex marriage.\n\n'The wind is to our back'\n\nDuring the fifth vote in November 2015, MLAs voted in favour of legalisation for the first time, with the slimmest majority of 53 votes to 52.\n\nHowever, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) used a Stormont veto, known as a petition of concern, to .\n\nAlliance MLA Paula Bradshaw said it was \"shameful\" the couples had been forced to take their cases to court.\n\n\"Last May both Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP refused the Alliance Party's proposal to reform the petition of concern - the crucial reform that would make equal marriage a reality,\" she said.\n\n\"Now the challenge has been thrown firmly back at the politicians and it is essential we get Stormont up and running again to stabilise Northern Ireland and start delivering for everyone.\"\n\nThe marriage of the couple in the Petition X case was treated as a civil partnership in Northern Ireland, under ,\n\nThe devolved distinction was made possible after negotiations between a previous Westminster government and a previous Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nThe couple took their vows \"because they believe in the traditional values associated with marriage,\" according to their solicitor.\n\n'Punching bag'\n\n\"We sighed when the ruling was read out not through disappointment, but simply because the inevitable recognition of same-sex marriage has been further delayed in Northern Ireland,\" they said.\n\n\"The work will continue, the wind is to our back.\"\n\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood said The LGBT community was \"not a punching bag to be hit again and again\".\n\n\"Ours is now the only small corner of these islands where we maintain a hierarchy of love,\" he said.\n\n\"We are increasingly isolated here and across Europe as a place where the commitment and compassion of a same-sex couple is not recognised or reflected in our law.\"\n\nSinn F\u00e9in MLA Car\u00e1l N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn said the issue was at the heart of the current political crisis in Northern Ireland - where the Assembly has been in limbo since power-sharing broke down in January.\n\n\"We need to see the implementation of agreements and an end to discrimination

campaigners in the only part of the United Kingdom that bans gay marriage.\n\nThe case was brought by three same-sex couples, backed by campaigners who are trying to pressure the region's largest party, the socially conservative Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), to reverse its veto on same-sex marriage.\n\nThe judge, Justice O'Hara, said the refusal to allow same- sex marriages in Northern Ireland was not a contravention of human rights \"because that right does not exist.\"\n\nO'Hara said it was up to Northern Ireland's devolved government to decide on the issue and that a ban on gay marriage did not violate international human rights standards.\n\nHe said the European Court of Human rights had ruled that the right to gay marriage was not a right under the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\n\"It is not difficult to understand how gay men and lesbians, who have suffered discrimination, rejection and exclusion, feel so strongly about the maintenance in Northern Ireland of the barrier to same sex marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"However, the judgement which I have to reach is not based on social policy but on law.\"\n\nThe ruling applied to two cases, the first brought by the first female couple and first male couple to have their civil partnership recognised in Northern Ireland: Shannon Sickles and Grainne Close and Christopher and Henry Flanagan-Kane.\n\nIn a second case - known as Petition X - a male couple that married in England in 2014 was challenging the downgrading of their relationship to a civil partnership when they moved to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe DUP, whose 10 seats in the British parliament prop up the government of Prime Minister Theresa May, have repeatedly vetoed gay marriage despite opinion polls that indicate it is supported by a significant majority in Northern Ireland.\n\nEarlier this month Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar visited a gay rights event in Belfast and said the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland was just a matter of time.\n\nThe couples did not speak to the media after the ruling, but Gavin Boyd of gay rights group The Rainbow Project said they were disappointed and would consider whether to appeal.\n\n\"This is now a matter for the politicians, the [Northern Ireland] Assembly or Theresa May,\" Boyd said.", "id": "9775224", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Britain's

Thursday, in a blow to campaigners in the only part of the United Kingdom that bans gay marriage.\n\nThe case was brought by three same-sex couples, backed by campaigners who are trying to pressure the region's largest party, the socially conservative Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), to reverse its veto on same-sex marriage.\n\nThe judge, Justice O'Hara, said the refusal to allow same- sex marriages in Northern Ireland was not a contravention of human rights \"because that right does not exist.\"\n\nO'Hara said it was up to Northern Ireland's devolved government to decide on the issue and that a ban on gay marriage did not violate international human rights standards.\n\nHe said the European Court of Human rights had ruled that the right to gay marriage was not a right under the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\n\"It is not difficult to understand how gay men and lesbians, who have suffered discrimination, rejection and exclusion, feel so strongly about the maintenance in Northern Ireland of the barrier to same sex marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"However, the judgement which I have to reach is not based on social policy but on law.\"\n\nThe ruling applied to two cases, the first brought by the first female couple and first male couple to have their civil partnership recognised in Northern Ireland: Shannon Sickles and Grainne Close and Christopher and Henry Flanagan-Kane.\n\nIn a second case - known as Petition X - a male couple that married in England in 2014 was challenging the downgrading of their relationship to a civil partnership when they moved to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe DUP, whose 10 seats in the British parliament prop up the government of Prime Minister Theresa May, have repeatedly vetoed gay marriage despite opinion polls that indicate it is supported by a significant majority in Northern Ireland.\n\nEarlier this month Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar visited a gay rights event in Belfast and said the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland was just a matter of time.\n\nThe couples did not speak to the media after the ruling, but Gavin Boyd of gay rights group The Rainbow Project said they were disappointed and would consider whether to appeal.\n\n\"This is now a matter for the politicians, the [Northern Ireland] Assembly or Theresa May,\" Boyd said.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and

The definition of marriage as between one man and one woman is beneficial for all society, and it is excellent news that it has not been changed by this ruling.'\n\nNorthern Ireland is the only part of the UK not to legalise same-sex marriage, despite becoming the first to legalise civil partnerships 12 years ago.\n\nAssembly members have now voted five times on whether to allow gay marriage. At the fifth vote they voted in favour for the first time by 53 to 52 but the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) used their Stormont veto to block the move.\n\nMs Sickles and Ms Close made history when they became the UK's first civilly partnered couple in Belfast City Hall in December 2005. They were closely followed by Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane, whose ceremony took place a day later.\n\nThe two couples are now leading the campaign for full marriage recognition, arguing the ban doesn't respect private and family life and so breaches article eight of the European Convention of Human Rights.\n\nClose said she was 'devastated' by the ruling, according to the BBC.\n\n'For us, this is a personal matter,' she said.\n\n'We have families and our children are being treated differently because of today's result.'", "id": "9868982", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Northern Ireland same-sex marriage ban not up to us, says High Court", "image": "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/31837/high-court.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1683, "date": "2005-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1696}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Judge"}, "id": "303132", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gay"}, "id": "304544", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marriage"}, "id": "304555", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}, "id": "306056", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}, "id": "306436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"}, {"label": {"eng": "LGBT"}, "id": "311925", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Convention on Human Rights"}, "id": "317369", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}, "id": "318643", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Unionist Party"}, "id": "322426", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Social policy"}, "id": "332985", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_policy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Civil union"}, "id": "343415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Belfast City Hall"}, "id": "378865", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_City_Hall"}, {"label": {"eng": "Christian Institute"}, "id": "844202", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Institute"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 233, "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 423, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 429, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men"}], "time": "10:12:00"}

The judgement said who entered a same-sex marriage in London in 2014 did not have his rights violated in Northern Ireland - where it was not recognised.\n\nThe Court ruled that same-sex couples were not entitled to be married, or have their marriage recognised in the country if they were wed elsewhere.\n\nJudge O'Hara said after rejecting both cases: \"To the frustration of supporters of same sex marriage the Assembly has not yet passed any measure to recognise and introduce same sex marriage.\n\n\"Their frustration is increased by the fact that the Assembly has voted by a majority in favour of same-sex marriages, but by reason of special voting arrangements which reflect the troubled past of this state, that majority has not been sufficient to give the vote effect in law.\"\n\nAnd he said that gay men and women has suffered discrimination, rejection and exclusion - but he had no power to challenge the current law.\n\nIn a historic referendum the Republic of Ireland followed suit - and Germany voted in favour earlier this summer.\n\nMore than 5,000 people turned out at a recent Price march in Belfast in favour of the LGBT+ community, indicating that the tide of popular opinion may be turning.\n\nOpenly gay Taoisech Leo Vadkar said it was \"only a matter of time\" before same-sex marriage is introduced in Northern Ireland - as he attended the march.\n\nVaradkar said: \"It is of course a decision for the Northern Ireland Assembly, but I am confident that like other western European countries they will make that decision in due course.\"\n\nThe DUP - who entered into an arrangement with the Conservatives after June's election - has repeatedly blocked gay marriage legislation in Stormont.\n\nBut just after the agreement was secured, Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson demanded that they support gay marriage in return for the \u00a31billion in new funding.\n\nThe party has a long history of being opposed to gay rights and abortion.\n\nBut leader Arlene Foster has insisted she is not homophobic.\n\nShe said: \"It really does hurt me when people call me a homophobe just because I stand up for the definition of marriage which I believe in.\"\n\nAnd she recently said the party would do \"everything in its power\" to resist calls from the UK to relax anti-abortion laws - putting her on a potential collision course with the UK Prime Minister in future.\n\nMrs May has vowed not to let the deal with the DUP affect gay rights in Britain.", "id": "9709562", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Belfast High Court rules same-sex marriage is NOT

Their policy is fervently anti-gay and anti-abortion, allegedly promoting \"traditional\" values.\n\nIn addition, Justice O'Hara ruled that it is lawful for Northern Ireland's authority to treat married gay couples that move to Northern Ireland as having civil partnerships.\n\nThree couples were making the case that Northern Ireland violates their human rights.\n\nTwo couples are Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane. They were backed by the gay rights group The Rainbow Project. One couple chose to keep its anonymity, but we know they are two gay men that were married in England in 2014. Their case is referred to as Petition X.\n\nMr. O'Hara also dismissed the claim that the couples' rights were violated under EU law, recalling that the European Court of Human rights had already ruled that the right to gay marriage is not enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe current Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, is the first openly gay prime minister.

Image: : Brian Lawless/PA Images\n\nA JUDGE IN Belfast has ruled that the rights of two same-sex couples have not been violated because they are not allowed to marry in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe judgment was delivered today after a number of challenges were taken to Northern Ireland's laws which do not allow same-sex couples to marry.\n\nIn his judgement this afternoon, Justice O'Hara stated that it is not against international human rights legislation to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples.\n\nCivil partnerships have been the law in Northern Ireland since 2004 and today's judgement stated that the law on marriage is in the power of the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n\nGrainne Close and Shannon Sickles entered into a civil partnership in Northern Ireland in 2005 and they were party to the case that led to today's proceedings.\n\nIn his judgement, Justice O'Hara acknowledged the \"frustration\" of those in favour of same-sex marriage about the current legal situation in the six counties.\n\nIn 2015, a majority of the NI Assembly voted in favour of same-sex marriage but the DUP blocked it by employing a petition stating that it required cross-community support.\n\n\"To the frustration of supporters of same-sex marriage the Assembly has not yet passed into law any measure to recognise and introduce same-sex marriage,\" the judge said.\n\nTheir frustration is increased by the fact that the Assembly has voted by a majority in favour of same-sex marriage, but by reason of special voting arrangements which reflect the troubled past of this State, that majority has not been sufficient to give the vote effect in law.\n\n\"It is not at all difficult to understand how gay men and lesbians who have suffered discrimination, rejection and exclusion feel so strongly about the maintenance in Northern Ireland of the barrier to same-sex marriage. However, the judgment which I have to reach is not based on social policy but on the law,\" the judge added.\n\nThe judgement quoted the European Court of Human Rights in saying that while parliaments are free to provide for same-sex marriage they are not obliged to do so.\n\nLove Equality, which campaigns for the extension of marriage to same-sex couples in Northern Ireland, said the group is \"hugely disappointed\" by today's ruling.\n\n\"The current laws in Northern Ireland preventing this are discriminatory and belong in the past. It is unacceptable that same-sex couples can marry in the rest of the UK, but not in Northern Ireland,\" Love Equality's Gr\u00e1inne Teggart said this afternoon.\n\nRead: Varadkar says it's 'only a matter of time' before North legalises same-sex marriage > Read: Malta votes to legalise same-sex marriage >", "id": "9725978", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Northern Ireland's ban on same-sex marriage does NOT breach human rights", "image": "http://img2.thejournal.ie/article/3551036/listing?version=3551241&width=590", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "91866", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Law"}, "id": "302557", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human rights"}, "id": "302584", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marriage"}, "id": "304555", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}, "id": "306056", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}, "id": "306436", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"}, {"label": {"eng": "LGBT"}, "id": "311925", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT"}, {"label": {"eng": "European Court of Human Rights"}, "id": "315550", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}, "id": "318643", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Unionist Party"}, "id": "322426", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Civil union"}, "id": "343415", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland Assembly"}, "id": "375840", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 42, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 227, "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 233, "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality"}], "time": "15:50:00"}

rights breach, a High Court judge has ruled.\n\nThe two men claimed they were subjected to discrimination by having their relationship \"downgraded\".\n\nBut Mr Justice O'Hara found there had been no violation under European law.\n\nHe said: \"The Strasbourg court has held that same-sex marriage is not even a (European) Convention right.\n\n\"While it's open to government and parliament to provide for it, they are not obliged to do so and whether they do so is a matter for them, not the courts.\"\n\nHis verdict represented a further blow to Northern Ireland's gay and lesbian community after a separate legal challenge to the ban on same-sex marriage was dismissed on similar grounds.\n\nGranted anonymity in the case, the petitioner 'X' and his husband wed in London in September 2014.\n\nBut under current laws they can only be classified as civil partners in Northern Ireland.\n\nThey were seeking a declaration that their marriage remains fully constituted throughout the UK.\n\nBeing limited to civil partnership status within Northern Ireland amounts to unlawful discrimination, according to their case.\n\nThe petition, backed by gay rights group The Rainbow Project, was taken against the Northern Ireland Assembly and the UK Government.\n\nLegislation passed in the rest of the UK and the Irish Republic allows same-sex couples to marry.\n\nHowever, Stormont has repeatedly refused to introduce the same change in the law.\n\nLawyers for X and his husband claimed their rights to privacy and family life, religious freedom and entitlement to marry under the European Convention on Human Rights have all been violated.\n\nThey insisted the case differed from the separate legal bid to have the same-sex marriage laws extended to Northern Ireland.\n\nDowngrading a marriage validly recognised in England, Wales and Scotland to civil partnership status in Northern Ireland amounts to an unlawful interference, it was argued.\n\nX and his husband were able to wed in England following the introduction of the Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Act 2013.\n\nBut counsel for UK's Government Equality Office (GEO) countered that there was never intended to be a \"one size fits all\" approach to the issue across the regions.\n\nHe insisted that a gay couple's ability to get married in England and Wales was a matter of policy rather than a legal obligation.\n\nBacking those submissions, Mr Justice O'Hara said: \"The judgment I have to reach is not based on social policy, but on the law.\"\n\nDismissing the case, he concluded: \"X's rights have not been violated by virtue of the fact that same-sex marriage he entered into in London in 2014 is recognised in Northern Ireland only as a civil partnership.\"", "id": "9872437", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title":

Getty Images\n\nA court in Northern Ireland has rejected a couple's plea to have their same-sex marriage recognised, asserting again that there are no exceptions to the territory's ban on equal marriage.\n\nA judge ruled that two men, who got married legally in London, could only be considered to be in a civil partnership while they are in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe couple, who have not made their names public, tried to have their union recognised as a full marriage on human rights grounds, but failed to persuade the Belfast High Court.\n\nWhen their petition was rejected on Thursday afternoon, they gave this powerful statement via their lawyer. It challenges the idea that gay marriage is a \"threat to society,\" an argument often put forward by opponents.\n\n\"We want our vows to be recognised in Northern Ireland because the traditional values associated with marriage are important to us.\n\n\"Of course we are disappointed by today's ruling. What it shows is that more work needs to be done to explain a truth that to us is self-evident: The love that two men or two women share is never a threat to society.\n\n\"In fact, the world could do with a little more love. Today we are calling on the Mums, Dads siblings, and friends of the LGBT+ people to no longer remain on the sidelines.\n\n\"If you too feel disappointed today, speak write or tweet to our political leaders reminding them that most people in Northern Ireland support same-sex marriage.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the UK's political settlement with Northern Ireland, same-sex marriage is a matter for the devolved political assembly. Northern Ireland has consistently chosen not to follow the rest of the country in legalising it.\n\nIn 2015, a majority of assembly members (AMs) did vote to legalise it, but were blocked by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who are currently in a loose coalition propping up the Conservative government in Westminster.\n\nThe prime minister, Theresa May (L) with the DUP leader Arlene Foster Reuters\n\nSome 53 AMs backed a same-sex marriage bill at the last vote, while only 52 opposed. But the DUP stopped the motion from passing by using an effective veto, known as a \"petition of concern\" to strike down the bill.\n\nWhen the petition is made in the assembly, the majority required increases from 50% to 60%, and also requires a minimum threshold of support from both unionist and nationalist parties, giving each side an effective veto.\n\nMr Justice O'Hara, the judge who made the ruling on Thursday, said his hands were tied and that only politicians can allow gay marriage in Northern Ireland, not the courts.\n\nIn a statement accompanying the ruling, he said:\n\n\"It is not at all difficult to understand how gay men and lesbians who have suffered discrimination, rejection, and exclusion feel so strongly about the maintenance in Northern Ireland of the barrier to same sex marriage.\n\n\"However, the judgment which I have to reach is not based on social policy but on the law.\"", "id": "9727617", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "'The love that two men or two women share is never a threat to a society:' Gay couple's powerful reaction to court ruling that their marriage is invalid in Northern Ireland", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5995b1d446a54c0970302cb3-1190-625/the-love-that-two-men-or-two-women-share-is-never-a-threat-to-a-society-gay-couples-powerful-reaction-to-court-ruling-that-their-marriage-is-invalid-in-northern-ireland.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "85555", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86522", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "91866", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human rights"}, "id": "302584", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Judge"}, "id": "303132", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge"}, {"label": {"eng": "Theresa May"}, "id": "304328", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marriage"}, "id": "304555", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}, "id": "305090", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images"}, {"label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}, "id": "305609", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Same-sex marriage"}, "id": "306056", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Veto"}, "id": "308439", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto"}, {"label": {"eng": "Devolution"}, "id": "312829", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Democratic Unionist Party"}, "id": "322426", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party"}, {"label": {"eng": "Civil union"}, "id": "343415", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Arlene Foster"}, "id": "450746", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Foster"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 233, "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 423, "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual"}], "time": "15:59:00"}

Ireland's ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nA High Court judge dismissed their discrimination case after ruling that the prohibition remains a matter for the Stormont administration.\n\nMr Justice O'Hara said: \"It's not the role of a judge to decide social policy, that is for the Executive and the Assembly under our constitution.\"\n\nGrainne Close, her partner Shannon Sickles, and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane took legal action in a bid to have the ban lifted.\n\nIn 2005 they became the first couples in the United Kingdom to enter civil partnerships, cementing their relationships in ceremonies at Belfast City Hall.\n\nBut unlike the rest of Britain and the Irish Republic, Northern Ireland has still not legalised same-sex marriage.\n\nStormont MLAs have voted five times on the issue - with a narrow majority in favour of the move on the last occasion in November 2015.\n\nHowever, the Democratic Unionist Party deployed a petition of concern mechanism to block the motion and prevent any change in the law.\n\nLawyers representing the two couples claimed they are suffering state discrimination after being marginalised all their lives.\n\nThey argued that the repeated refusal to legislation breaches their entitlement to family life and marriage under the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nIn proceedings issued against the Department of Finance and Personnel, Northern Ireland was described as \"a blot on the map\" seen by the rest of the world as backward-looking and divided.\n\nBeing relegated to the second-class status of civil partnerships is demeaning and offensive to the couples' unions, it was contended.\n\nAccording to their case, the ban is having a \"corrosive\" impact on society.\n\nCounsel for the Stormont department under challenge insisted the two couples have suffered no grave breach of their human rights.\n\nHe also denied there has been any \"legislative inertia\" on the issue.\n\nDelivering judgment in front of a packed courtroom, Mr Justice O'Hara acknowledged the \"compelling evidence\" of how the gay and lesbian community has long suffered less favourable treatment.\n\nHe cited the insults, psychiatric damage and exclusion endured by its members.\n\nBut the judge stressed that the challenge was going against all recent European case law.\n\n\"If there's a move it's undoubtedly towards recognition of same-sex marriage,\" he said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, from the applicants' perspective, there's no sign of the Strasbourg court [Eurpean Court of Human Rights] moving in that direction.\"\n\nThe legal challenge does not fall into the limited category of circumstances warranting judicial intervention, he held.\n\nMr Justice O'Hara added: \"Put simply, the Strasbourg court has not recognised any right to same-sex marriage.\"\n\nWith any bid to achieve such status now resting with Stormont, he concluded by saying: \"I hope when the Assembly next sits to consider this issue those with the responsibility of voting will read the evidence in this case.\"", "id": "9712980", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Gay couples lose legal challenge to North's marriage ban", "image":

To further hinder progress, the country's Executive and Assembly are currently disbanded due to the collapse of power-sharing.\n\nFollowing the court ruling, LGBT activists say that the only way to secure equal marriage in the region without the Assembly functioning is for the UK government to directly intervene.\n\nSpeaking after the judgment, Director of The Rainbow Project John O'Doherty said: \"Of course, we would prefer that the Northern Ireland Assembly were in a position to grant these rights; the Assembly is not currently functioning.\n\n\"It is, therefore, the responsibility of Theresa May's government to make the necessary amendments to the marriage legislation to make it applicable in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"The eyes of LGBT people around the world will now be on Theresa May. She says that she has changed her mind on LGBT equality over her years in Parliament. Now is her chance to prove it.\"\n\nClare Moore of Love Equality concurred: \"During this period of political instability it is now imperative that the Westminster government takes immediate action to ensure that the rights of LGBT people in United Kingdom are available for all UK citizens.\"\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May recently expressed her personal support for same-sex marriage, in an exclusive column for PinkNews.\n\nWriting for PinkNews, Mrs May affirmed: \"I want all British citizens to enjoy the fullest freedoms and protections. That includes equal marriage - because marriage should be for everyone, regardless of their sexuality.\n\n\"And while that is a matter for the devolved government of Northern Ireland, I will continue to make my position clear - that LGBT+ people in Northern Ireland should have the same rights as people across the rest of the UK.\"\n\nGiven the continued failure of power-sharing talks in the country it is unclear whether Mrs May would go as far as to impose the issue via direct rule.\n\nAny such decision would likely imperil her confidence and supply deal with the Democratic Unionist Party, which is crucial to keeping the Conservative government afloat in Westminster.\n\nThe leader of the Democratic Unionist Party Arlene Foster recently vowed to keep blocking equal marriage.\n\nShe defended her actions by insisting gay people don't really want to get married anyway.\n\nMs Foster said: \"This suggestion that every single person who's a homosexual wants to change the definition of marriage is actually wrong.\n\n\"I know plenty of people in that community who don't want to see marriage redefined and are quite content to live in partnership... it's all become a bit of a storm in a teacup.\"\n\nFoster has also branded the campaign for equal marriage \"toxic\" - for suggesting she has homophobic views.\n\nShe said: \"[The] most frustrating thing about this whole debate is the fact that if you stand up for marriage and if you stand up for the definition of marriage as we believe in it, then in some way that makes you homophobic and a hater of gays.\n\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth as far as I personally am concerned and it really does hurt me when people call me a homophobe just because I stand up for the definition of marriage which I believe in and I think this debate has become very toxic.\"", "id": "9717809", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Theresa May urged to intervene for equal marriage in Northern

Fortson was home alone and on a Facetime call with a friend when deputies arrived at his door, Crump said.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nFortson was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom the attorney didn't identify, said Fortson heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nOn Wednesday, when he released a statement about Fortson's death, Crump was in Ohio for the funeral of Frank Tyson, a 53-year-old who died in police custody on April 18.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's statements. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "local10.com", "dataType":

He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nOn Wednesday, Crump was in Ohio for the funeral of Frank Tyson, a 53-year-old who died in police custody on April 18.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's statements. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news",

Fortson was home alone and on a Facetime call with a friend when deputies arrived at his door, Crump said.\n\nFortson was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom the attorney didn't identify, said Fortson heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nOn Wednesday, when he released a statement about Fortson's death, Crump was in Ohio for the funeral of Frank Tyson, a 53-year-old who died in police custody on April 18.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's statements. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Curt Anderson in St.

(AP) -- The mother of a Black U.S. Air Force airman who was fatally shot by deputies who burst into his apartment in the Florida Panhandle began crying while listening to her family's attorney recount the death of her son.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" said Chantimekki Fortson at a news conference on Thursday in Fort Walton Beach, where her son, Senior Airmen Roger Fortson, was living when he was killed.\n\nThe family's attorney, Ben Crump, said that Senior Airmen Roger Fortson said Okaloosa County sheriff's deputies responding to a disturbance call at the apartment complex burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot Fortson when they saw he was armed with a gun.\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nCrump, a noted civil rights attorney, called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing\" and said the sheriff's office needed to own up to it instead of creating a counter-narrative that deputies were acting in self-defense.\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. Fortson was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson was home alone and on a Facetime call with a friend when deputies arrived, Crump said.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom the attorney didn't identify, said Fortson heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's statements. Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nSchneider reported from Orlando, Fla.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors":

Following graduation, Fortson enlisted in the Air Force, where he was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field -- right near Fort Walton Beach.\n\nFortson can be seen below on graduation day at McNair High School:\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump said in a statement that Fortson was on a FaceTime call with a woman at the time of the encounter.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom Crump didn't identify, said Fortson was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their FaceTime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd. Crump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's claims. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nLast week when the sheriff's office said the deputy reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man, the office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.", "source": {"uri":

Fortson was home alone and on a Facetime call with a friend when deputies arrived at his door, Crump said.\n\nFortson was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom the attorney didn't identify, said Fortson heard a knock at the door.

Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Curt Anderson in St.

He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,'' Crump said. ''They took a patriot from us.''\n\nCrump, a noted civil rights attorney, called the shooting ''an unjustifiable killing'' and said the sheriff's office needed to own up to it instead of creating a counter-narrative that deputies were acting in self-defense.\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. Fortson was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field.\n\n''He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,'' Crump said.\n\nFortson was home alone and on a Facetime call with a friend when deputies arrived, Crump said.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom the attorney didn't identify, said Fortson heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's statements. Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n''At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,'' Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_schneider@startribune.com", "name":

He was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron and entered active duty on Nov. 19, 2019.\n\nAccording to the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office, a deputy responded to a call of a disturbance in progress on the afternoon of Friday, May 3.\n\nThe deputy \"encountered an armed man,\" according to a news release, and the deputy shot the man.\n\nFortson was taken to a local hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries, according to police.\n\nThe deputy in question has been placed on administrative leave pending the results of an investigation from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's claims. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama

He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's claims. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the

He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nOn Wednesday, when he released a statement about Fortson's death, Crump was in Ohio for the funeral of Frank Tyson, a 53-year-old who died in police custody on April 18.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's statements. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType":

(Air Force)\n\nThe Air Force has identified a man shot and killed by a Florida sheriff's deputy Friday as Senior Airman Roger Fortson.\n\nFortson, 23, was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron at Hurlburt Field, Florida, where he served as a gunner on the AC-130J Ghostrider.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said a deputy was responding to a call of a disturbance around 4:30 p.m. local time Friday when they encountered an armed individual at an apartment located at 319 Racetrack Road NW in Fort Walton Beach, just several miles from Hurlburt.\n\nThe deputy heard sounds of a disturbance and reacted in self defense after identifying himself as law enforcement, the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said in a news release.\n\nFortson was taken to a local hospital where he died. The deputy was placed on paid administrative leave, pending the outcome of an investigation and administrative review.\n\nAn Okaloosa County Sheriff's spokesperson did not immediately respond to a phone message from Air Force Times Tuesday.\n\nThe Air Force said Monday that Fortson was at his off-base residence at the time of the incident. The 1st Special Operations Wing is providing casualty affairs service to his family and a spokesperson for the wing told Air Force Times that it sent a base-wide message out reminding them of the availability of mental health, chaplain, and other resources.\n\nFortson entered active duty on Nov. 19, 2019.\n\nOkaloosa Sheriff's Deputy Jesse Hernandez resigned in November after an officer-involved shooting, during which he mistook a falling acorn striking his patrol vehicle for a gun shot.

Fortson was home alone and on a Facetime call with a friend when deputies arrived at his door, Crump said.\n\nFortson was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom the attorney didn't identify, said Fortson heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nOn Wednesday, when he released a statement about Fortson's death, Crump was in Ohio for the funeral of Frank Tyson, a 53-year-old who died in police custody on April 18.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's statements. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Fortson was home alone and on a Facetime call with a friend when deputies arrived at his door, Crump said.\n\nFortson was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom the attorney didn't identify, said Fortson heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nOn Wednesday, when he released a statement about Fortson's death, Crump was in Ohio for the funeral of Frank Tyson, a 53-year-old who died in police custody on April 18.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's statements. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri":

He asked who was there but did not get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but did not see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was not causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said in the statement.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa county sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. The office did not respond to an email or phone message on Wednesday. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida department of law enforcement and the local state attorney's office will investigate the shooting.\n\nPolice spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told the Associated Press on Wednesday it is highly unlikely the agency would have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nThe sheriff's office did not immediately respond to an email or voicemail seeking comment Wednesday by the Associated Press.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.",

He was on a Facetime call at the time with an unnamed woman, civil rights attorney Ben Crump said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nCiting her account of the confrontation, Crump said 23-year-old Fortson was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock at his door, prompting him to call out and ask who was there. He received no answer, though there was another louder, more forceful knock a short time later. This time, Fortson checked the peep hole, but he did not see anyone on the other side, the unidentified woman recalled. Still, he was worried, so he went to retrieve his gun, which he legally owned, according to Crump.\n\nAs Fortson returned, deputies busted into his apartment, saw he was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was struck in the gunfire, the civil rights attorney noted.\n\nFortson later died at the hospital.

She believes the deputies were meant to respond elsewhere in the apartment building, but entered Fortson's unit instead.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the

Fortson was home alone and on a Facetime call with a friend when deputies arrived at his door, Crump said.\n\nFortson was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom the attorney didn\u00b4t identify, said Fortson heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn\u00b4t get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn\u00b4t see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman\u00b4s account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump\u00b4s statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can\u00b4t breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFILE - Civil rights attorney Ben Crump speaks in the Audubon Ballroom, now part of The Malcolm X & Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, in New York, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2024. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn\u00b4t causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump\u00b4s statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger\u00b4s death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger\u00b4s death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nOn Wednesday, when he released a statement about Fortson's death, Crump was in Ohio for the funeral of Frank Tyson, a 53-year-old who died in police custody on April 18.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff\u00b4s Office didn\u00b4t immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump\u00b4s statements. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community\u00b4s patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff\u00b4s office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney\u00b4s Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson\u00b4s death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson\u00b4s front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I\u00b4m trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

He was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron and entered active duty on Nov. 19, 2019.\n\nAccording to the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office, a deputy responded to a call of a disturbance in progress on the afternoon of Friday, May 3.\n\nThe deputy \"encountered an armed man,\" according to a news release, and the deputy shot the man.\n\nFortson was taken to a local hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries, according to police.\n\nThe deputy in question has been placed on administrative leave pending the results of an investigation from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Police said the state attorney's office will also conduct an independent review of the incident.\n\nFortson's family has retained national civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump to represent them. Crump has represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, among others.\n\nAccording to a news release from Crump's law office, the encounter played out differently than what the OCSO has been reporting.\n\nCrump says a witness who was on a FaceTime call with Fortson at the time of the shooting said that Fortson was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock at his door.\n\nFortson asked, \"Who is it?\" and failed to get a response, Crump said in a news release Wednesday.\n\nA few minutes later, Fortson heard an \"aggressive\" knock, but failed to see anyone once he looked out his peephole.\n\nFortson, concerned for his safety, retrieved his legally owned gun, the release says. As Fortson returned to the living room, the witness said, deputies \"burst through his door.\" When deputies saw the gun, they fired at Fortson six times.\n\nBen Crump: Civil rights attorney Ben Crump now represents family of slain Hurlburt Field airman\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said in his statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family. His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy,\" Crump said in the statement.\n\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

The video shows the deputy banging on the door, stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. Twice he shouted: \"Sheriff's office!\"\n\nThe door opened, and the deputy shouted, \"Step back!\" The deputy then fired off shots, and shouted, \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Do not move!\" The deputy then called for paramedics on his radio.\n\nNoted civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, earlier had asked the sheriff's office for transparency and disputed the narrative authorities released following the May 3 shooting. Email and text messages were sent to Crump on Thursday afternoon seeking comment about what the bodycam footage showed and the sheriff's describing as inaccurate Crump's statements that the deputy went to the wrong apartment and didn't announce himself.\n\nThe deputy is seen on the video arriving at an apartment building and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nCrump told reporters earlier that Fortson had grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment, got no response when he asked who was there and discovered the peephole on his door was blocked. He said Fortson was alone at the time.\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputies. Officials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting.\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death inside his Fort Walton Beach apartment.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"He was just in his apartment, minding his businesses,\" Crump said. \"They could have made sure they were at the right apartment. They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door.\"\n\nIn a statement last week, the sheriff's office said a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times and died at a hospital. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson was talking to his girlfriend, who hasn't yet been identified, on FaceTime when deputies burst into his apartment on May 3, Crump added.\n\nWithout her, his family wouldn't have known what happened, he said. The girlfriend notified his mother, who drove to Fort Walton Beach to find out that her son was dead.\n\nAt the hospital, deputies approached Chantemekki Fortson, and she told them, \"'You guys have killed my baby. Just take me to my baby please. I just want to see my child,'\" she recounted at the news conference.\n\n\"They had taken my gift,\" she said. \"My heart is bleeding, and they wanted to talk to me. They told me the investigation was ongoing,\" she said.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said in the statement.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. The office did not respond to an email or phone message on Wednesday. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nThe sheriff's office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail seeking comment Wednesday by The Associated Press.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Curt Anderson contributed to this story from St. Petersburg, Florida.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors":

(AP) -- The family of a Black U.S. Air Force airman who was fatally shot by deputies who burst into his apartment in the Florida Panhandle said Thursday that they want to correct a false narrative put forth by authorities about the encounter that led to his death.\n\nThe family of Senior Airmen Roger Fortson planned to view body camera video later in the day. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the family, said Fortson did not know it was sheriff's deputies who were breaking into his apartment -- \"his castle\" -- and that he grabbed his \"legally owned firearm\" to protect himself.\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into a news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death inside his apartment in Fort Walton Beach.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office planned to hold a news conference later Thursday afternoon. It has declined to identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nCrump said deputies responding to a disturbance call burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot Fortson when they saw he had a gun. He said Fortson had grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment, got no response when he asked who was there and discovered the peephole on his door was blocked.\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nCrump, a noted civil rights attorney, called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing\" and said the sheriff's office needed to own up to it instead of creating a counter-narrative that deputies were acting in self-defense.\n\n\"He was just in his apartment, minding his businesses,\" Crump said of sheriff's deputies. \"They could have made sure they were at the right apartment. They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door.\"\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office has not responded to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's account. In a statement last week, it said a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times and died at a hospital. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nFortson had constitutional rights to have the firearm and against unreasonable searches by the police, Crump said. He led family members and other attorneys in a chant of \"Clear Roger's Name.\"\n\n\"Any law-abiding citizens who feel they have a right to the Fourth Amendment and the Second Amendment, they should be troubled by this,\" Crump said.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson was talking to his girlfriend, who hasn't yet been identified, on FaceTime when deputies burst into his apartment on May 3, Crump added.\n\nWithout her, his family wouldn't have known what happened, he said. The girlfriend notified his mother, who drove to Fort Walton Beach to find out that her son was dead.\n\nAt the hospital, deputies approached Chantemekki Fortson, and she told them, \"'You guys have killed my baby. Just take me to my baby please. I just want to see my child,'\" she recounted at the news conference.\n\n\"They had taken my gift,\" she said. \"My heart is bleeding, and they wanted to talk to me. They told me the investigation was ongoing,\" she said.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nThe spelling of the name of Fortson's mother has been corrected to Chantemekki instead of Chantimekki.", "source": {"uri": "mynorthwest.com",

They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door.\"\n\nThe Okaloosa county sheriff's office has not responded to an email or voicemail from the Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's account.\n\nIn a statement last week, the office said a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times and died at a hospital. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nFortson had constitutional rights to have the firearm and against unreasonable searches by the police, Crump said. He led family members and other attorneys in a chant of: \"Clear Roger's name.\"\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the US air force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the special operations wing at Hurlburt Field. He was a special missions aviator, and one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson had been talking to his girlfriend, who hasn't yet been identified, on FaceTime when deputies burst into his apartment on 3 May, Crump added.\n\nWithout her, his family wouldn't have known what had happened, he said. The girlfriend notified his mother, who drove to Fort Walton Beach to find out that her son was dead.\n\nAt the hospital, deputies approached Chantemekki Fortson, and she told them: \"'You guys have killed my baby. Just take me to my baby, please. I just want to see my child,'\" she recounted at the news conference.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to those of other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a non-emergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

Fortson was home alone and on a Facetime call with a friend when deputies arrived at his door, Crump said.\n\nFortson was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nOn Wednesday, when he released a statement about Fortson's death, Crump was in Ohio for the funeral of Frank Tyson, a 53-year-old who died in police custody on April 18.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's statements. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

When there was a second, louder knock, he looked through the peephole and said he couldn't see anyone. He went to retrieve his gun -- which Crump said was legally owned -- and as he returned to the living room, deputies burst through the door. One of them shot Fortson six times.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's claims. Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement Wednesday on Facebook expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not say who made the call.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws similarities to other Black people killed in their homes by police.\n\nIn 2018, Dallas police officer Amber Guyger fatally shot Botham Jean after mistaking his apartment for her own. Guyger was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, Fort Worth police officer Aaron Dean fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Dean was found guilty of manslaughter and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nIn 2020, sheriff's Deputy Jason Meade fatally shot Casey Goodson, who reportedly was holding a bag of sandwiches as he walked into his grandmother's home in Columbus, Ohio. A mistrial was declared in February in Meade's prosecution on a murder charge.\n\nThe Okaloosa County sheriff's office made news last year when one of its deputies mistook the sound of a falling acorn for a gunshot and opened fire on his own SUV, where a handcuffed Black suspect was sitting.\n\n____Associated Press reporters Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Aaron Morrison in New York

A few minutes later, there was a \"very aggressive knock,\" but Fortson didn't see anyone when he looked out the peephole.\n\n\"Concerned, he did what any other law-abiding citizen would do and retrieved his legally-owned gun,\" Crump said.\n\nAs Fortson walked back to his living room, \"police burst through the door\" and shot him six times, Crump said, adding that the witness said they saw Fortson on the ground saying, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said a deputy encountered Fortson with a gun while responding to a disturbance around 4:30 p.m. local time Friday at an apartment located at 319 Racetrack Road NW in Fort Walton Beach, just several miles from Hurlburt Field, where Fortson served as a gunner on the AC-130J Ghostrider in the 4th Special Operations Squadron.\n\nFortson died at a local hospital, officials said.\n\nFew other details have been released about the shooting, including the type of disturbance they were responding to. The sheriff's office late Tuesday declined to release body camera footage, an incident report and other recordings related to the shooting to Air Force Times, citing an ongoing investigation.\n\nAccording to an unverified audio recording of a dispatch call posted on Facebook, police received a disturbance call related to a male and female and that it was called in by an apartment complex's leasing office. The recording refers to a Black male who had been shot \"multiple\" times in the chest.\n\nFortson's apartment complex declined to comment to Air Force Times.\n\nThe deputy who shot Fortson, who has not been identified, has been placed on paid administrative leave and Okaloosa Sheriff Eric Aden said Wednesday afternoon that he has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to handle the investigation into the matter.\n\nWhile he asked for the \"community's patience,\" Crump demanded \"immediate answers.\"\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment. The narrative released by law enforcement, which falsely suggests that Roger posed a threat, is deeply troubling and inconsistent with the details provided by that witness: Roger was home alone, causing no disturbance, when his life was tragically cut short by law enforcement,\" Crump said in a statement.\n\nCrump could not be immediately reached for comment. He is a well-known civil rights attorney who has represented families in high-profile cases involving Black people killed by law enforcement, including George Floyd, Michael Brown and Breonna Taylor.\n\nHurlburt Field has said in social media posts that the base is supporting Fortson's family and offering assistance to grieving airmen.\n\nThe Okaloosa Sheriff's Office faced scrutiny last year after a deputy mistook a falling acorn striking his patrol vehicle for a gun shot and fired at his SUV while a suspect sat inside restrained. According to an internal investigation, Deputy Jesse Hernandez believed the shot came from inside his vehicle. The suspect, who is Black, was uninjured in the shooting. The sheriff's office determined Hernandez' use of force was not reasonable and he resigned in November.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

(AP) -- The mother of a Black U.S. Air Force airman who was fatally shot by deputies who burst into his apartment in the Florida Panhandle began crying while listening to her family's attorney recount the death of her son.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" said Chantimekki Fortson at a news conference on Thursday in Fort Walton Beach, where her son, Senior Airmen Roger Fortson, was living when he was killed.\n\nThe family's attorney, Ben Crump, said that Senior Airmen Roger Fortson said Okaloosa County sheriff's deputies responding to a disturbance call at the apartment complex burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot Fortson when they saw he was armed with a gun.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nCrump, a noted civil rights attorney, called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing\" and said the sheriff's office needed to own up to it instead of creating a counter-narrative that deputies were acting in self-defense.\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. Fortson was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson was home alone and on a Facetime call with a friend when deputies arrived, Crump said.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom the attorney didn't identify, said Fortson heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's statements. Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook on Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nSchneider reported from Orlando, Fla.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The video shows the deputy banging on the door, stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. Twice he shouted: \"Sheriff's office!\"\n\nThe door opened, and the deputy shouted, \"Step back!\" The deputy then fired off shots, and shouted, \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Do not move!\" The deputy then called for paramedics on his radio.\n\nNoted civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, earlier had asked the sheriff's office for transparency and disputed the narrative authorities released following the May 3 shooting. Email and text messages were sent to Crump on Thursday afternoon seeking comment about what the bodycam footage showed and the sheriff's describing as inaccurate Crump's statements that the deputy went to the wrong apartment and didn't announce himself.\n\nRelated Story: US Service Member Shot and Killed by Florida Police Identified by the Air Force\n\nThe deputy is seen on the video arriving at an apartment building and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nCrump told reporters earlier that Fortson had grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment, got no response when he asked who was there and discovered the peephole on his door was blocked. He said Fortson was alone at the time.\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting.\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death inside his Fort Walton Beach apartment.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"He was just in his apartment, minding his businesses,\" Crump said. \"They could have made sure they were at the right apartment. They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door.\"\n\nRelated Story: Police Clear Pro-Palestinian Protest Camp and Arrest 33 at DC Campus as ...\n\nIn a statement last week, the sheriff's office said a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times and died at a hospital. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson was talking to his girlfriend, who hasn't yet been identified, on FaceTime when deputies burst into his apartment on May 3, Crump added.\n\nWithout her, his family wouldn't have known what happened, he said. The girlfriend notified his mother, who drove to Fort Walton Beach to find out that her son was dead.\n\nAt the hospital, deputies approached Chantemekki Fortson, and she told them, \"'You guys have killed my baby. Just take me to my baby please. I just want to see my child,'\" she recounted at the news conference.\n\n\"They had taken my gift,\" she said. \"My heart is bleeding, and they wanted to talk to me. They told me the investigation was ongoing,\" she said.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own.

(AP) -- The family of a Black U.S. Air Force airman who was fatally shot by deputies who burst into his apartment in the Florida Panhandle said Thursday that they wanted to clear his name and that authorities had put forth a false narrative that deputies acted in self-defense.\n\nSenior Airmen Roger Fortson did not know it was sheriff's deputies who were breaking into his apartment -- \"his castle\" -- and that he grabbed his \"legally registered firearm\" to protect himself, civil rights attorney Ben Crump told reporters. Fortson's family planned to view body camera video later in the day.\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death inside his Fort Walton Beach apartment.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office planned to hold a news conference later Thursday afternoon. It has declined to identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nCrump said deputies responding to a disturbance call burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot Fortson when they saw he had a gun. He said Fortson had grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment, got no response when he asked who was there and discovered the peephole on his door was blocked.\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nCrump, a noted civil rights attorney, called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing\" and said the sheriff's office needed to own up to it instead of maintaining that deputies were acting in self-defense.\n\n\"He was just in his apartment, minding his businesses,\" Crump said. \"They could have made sure they were at the right apartment. They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office has not responded to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's account. In a statement last week, the office said a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times and died at a hospital. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nFortson had constitutional rights to have the firearm and against unreasonable searches by the police, Crump said. He led family members and other attorneys in a chant of, \"Clear Roger's name.\"\n\n\"Any law-abiding citizens who feel they have a right to the Fourth Amendment and the Second Amendment, they should be troubled by this,\" Crump said.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson was talking to his girlfriend, who hasn't yet been identified, on FaceTime when deputies burst into his apartment on May 3, Crump added.\n\nWithout her, his family wouldn't have known what happened, he said. The girlfriend notified his mother, who drove to Fort Walton Beach to find out that her son was dead.\n\nAt the hospital, deputies approached Chantemekki Fortson, and she told them, \"'You guys have killed my baby. Just take me to my baby please. I just want to see my child,'\" she recounted at the news conference.\n\n\"They had taken my gift,\" she said. \"My heart is bleeding, and they wanted to talk to me. They told me the investigation was ongoing,\" she said.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nOutside Jimmy Klass's mobile home in Clearwater, symbols of American pride hang all around his residence.

(AP) -- A Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman inside his apartment in the state's Panhandle, body camera video shown to reporters Thursday shows.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys held a news conference in which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense.\n\nThe video from the deputy's body camera showed that Fortson answered his apartment door with what appears to be handgun pointed down toward the floor. The video shows the deputy banging on the door, stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. Twice he shouted: \"Sheriff's office!\"\n\nThe door opened, and the deputy shouted, \"Step back!\" The deputy then fired off shots, and shouted, \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Do not move!\" The deputy then called for paramedics on his radio.\n\nNoted civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, earlier had asked the sheriff's office for transparency and disputed the narrative authorities released following the May 3 shooting. An email was sent to Crump's office Thursday afternoon seeking comment about what the bodycam footage showed and the sheriff's describing as inaccurate Crump's statements that the deputy went to the wrong apartment and didn't announce himself.\n\nAlden is seen on the video arriving at an apartment building and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nCrump told reporters earlier that Fortson had grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment, got no response when he asked who was there and discovered the peephole on his door was blocked.\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting.\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death inside his Fort Walton Beach apartment.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"He was just in his apartment, minding his businesses,\" Crump said. \"They could have made sure they were at the right apartment. They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door.\"\n\nIn a statement last week, the sheriff's office said a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times and died at a hospital. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson was talking to his girlfriend, who hasn't yet been identified, on FaceTime when deputies burst into his apartment on May 3, Crump added.\n\nWithout her, his family wouldn't have known what happened, he said. The girlfriend notified his mother, who drove to Fort Walton Beach to find out that her son was dead.\n\nAt the hospital, deputies approached Chantemekki Fortson, and she told them, \"'You guys have killed my baby. Just take me to my baby please. I just want to see my child,'\" she recounted at the news conference.\n\n\"They had taken my gift,\" she said. \"My heart is bleeding, and they wanted to talk to me. They told me the investigation was ongoing,\" she said.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nThe spelling of the name of Fortson's mother has been corrected to Chantemekki instead of Chantimekki.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com",

The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times and died at a hospital. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nFortson had constitutional rights to have the firearm and against unreasonable searches by the police, Crump said. He led family members and other attorneys in a chant of, \"Clear Roger's name.\"\n\n\"Any law-abiding citizens who feel they have a right to the Fourth Amendment and the Second Amendment, they should be troubled by this,\" Crump said.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson was talking to his girlfriend, who hasn't yet been identified, on FaceTime when deputies burst into his apartment on May 3, Crump added.\n\nWithout her, his family wouldn't have known what happened, he said. The girlfriend notified his mother, who drove to Fort Walton Beach to find out that her son was dead.\n\nAt the hospital, deputies approached Chantemekki Fortson, and she told them, \"'You guys have killed my baby. Just take me to my baby please. I just want to see my child,'\" she recounted at the news conference.\n\n\"They had taken my gift,\" she said. \"My heart is bleeding, and they wanted to talk to me. They told me the investigation was ongoing,\" she said.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nThe spelling of the name of Fortson's mother has been corrected to Chantemekki instead of Chantimekki.", "source": {"uri": "delcotimes.com",

According to Crump, the witness said Fortson was alone at the time.\n\nHer relationship to Fortson was not disclosed.\n\nDeputies communicated with dispatch that Fortson had been shot six times with multiple gunshot wounds to the chest with one exit wound, according to police dispatch calls, obtained by CNN affiliate WEAR.\n\nOfficers can be heard saying that there was a \"disturbance ... physical in progress,\" in the dispatch calls, WEAR reported.\n\n\"Fortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron.

The officer - off duty but still in uniform - lived on the floor below Jean's and said she approached what she believed to be her own apartment when she saw Jean inside.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson was killed that same year when a Fort Worth officer, responding to what police believed to be a burglary, shot her through her bedroom window.\n\nThe officer testified at trial that Jefferson pointed a gun at him, but prosecutors argued there was no evidence he saw the gun before opening fire.

An Air Force representative informed Task and Purpose that he served as a Special Missions Aviator with the AC-130J gunships of the 4th Special Operations Squadron. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump who is representing the family shared a photo of Fortson on social media standing with his little sister and captioned the post by saying, \"This is Roger Fortson and his little sister.

That's when Fortson grabbed his gun that legally owned and walked into the living room. Deputies then burst through the door and shot him 6 times.\n\nSubsequently, he passed away at a hospital, as stated by Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden in a press release on Tuesday, May 7. Furthermore, the deputy responsible for shooting Fortson was put on administrative leave while an investigation is conducted.\n\nCrump stated that according to the woman, Fortson was not causing any disturbance, leading her to believe that the deputies had mistakenly targeted the wrong apartment.\n\nRELATED: Shocking Footage Shows The Moment Samuel Sterling Was Hit by unmarked Michigan State Police Vehicle\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said in his statement.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodunlocked.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's claims. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press reporters Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "oneidadispatch.com",

He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, there was a very aggressive knock on the door, Crump said in a statement, but Fortson didn't see anyone when he looked out the peephole.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said in the statement.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nOfficials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden said Wednesday in a statement, \"All of us at the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office are saddened about the fatal officer involved shooting over the weekend.\"\n\nAden said that he immediately placed the deputy on administrative leave and has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to conduct the investigation that is required in such incidents. The State Attorney's Office will also conduct an independent review.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic

Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the

The Air Force says the airman supporting its Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field, Fla., was shot and killed on May 3, 2024, during an incident involving the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office.\n\nBy David Fischer, Associated Press\n\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 | 4:27 p.m.\n\nMIAMI -- Deputies responding to a disturbance call at a Florida apartment complex burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot a Black U.S. Air Force airman who was home alone when they saw he was armed with a gun, an attorney for the man's family said Wednesday.\n\nSenior Airman Roger Fortson, 23, who was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field, was in his off-base apartment in Fort Walton Beach when the shooting happened on May 3.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump said in a statement that Fortson was on a Facetime call with a woman at the time of the encounter.\n\nAccording to Crump, the woman, whom Crump didn't identify, said Fortson was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock at the door. He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said in the statement.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. The office did not respond to an email or phone message on Wednesday. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nThe sheriff's office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail seeking comment Wednesday by The Associated Press.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida

He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's claims. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office was responding to a disturbance between a man and woman in the apartment building, and deputies shot Fortson, who was Black, multiple times in the chest, according to police radio communications.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said. \"The narrative released by law enforcement, which falsely suggests that Roger posed a threat, is deeply troubling and inconsistent with the details provided by that witness: Roger was home alone, causing no disturbance, when his life was tragically cut short by law enforcement.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the attorney's claims. The sheriff's office recently came under scrutiny after one of its deputies resigned following an internal investigation last year of an incident in which he fired his weapon multiple times at a detained suspect after mistaking the sound of an acorn hitting the roof of his patrol vehicle as a gunshot, GulfLive.com reported.\n\nFortson lived in an off-base residence, and his special operations squadron at Hurlburt Field in the Florida panhandle flies AC-130J Ghostrider gunships.\n\nCrump said there was no disturbance and that Fortson was home alone on a video call with another person, who reported the airman heard a knock on the door.\n\nFortson, according to the witness, asked, \"Who is it?\" But he didn't receive an answer. After a subsequent \"aggressive\" second knock and seeing no one through the peephole, Fortson grabbed his legally owned gun, Crump detailed.\n\nAs Fortson was walking back to his living room, police entered the apartment and shot him. He reportedly said, \"I can't breathe\" while on the ground after being shot, Crump said, repeating a witness account of the event.\n\nPublicly available police radio audio reviewed by Military.com reported a call for a disturbance at an apartment complex at 319 Racetrack Road around 4:30 p.m. local time.\n\n\"Don't have anything further than a male and female; it's all fourth party information from the front desk at the leasing office,\" a deputy said on the radio.\n\nA few minutes later, another deputy called in to report \"shots fired, suspect down,\" and called for emergency medical services.\n\n\"Multiple gunshot wounds to the chest, Black male,\" another deputy chimes in shortly after. Fortson was shot six times, Crump said in his statement.\n\nNo other details, including the circumstances of the disturbance that prompted the local deputies to visit the apartment building, were released. Fortson was taken to an area hospital, where he later died. No officers were harmed in the incident.\n\nFortson joined the Air Force on November 19, 2019, according to a copy of his service record provided to Military.com. He joined as an AC-130J gunner. Crump added that Roger graduated from high school with honors and had no criminal record.\n\nThe deputy involved was not identified in the news release and was \"placed on paid administrative leave\" pending the outcome of an investigation and administrative review, the sheriff's office said.\n\nOn Monday evening, Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden released a statement saying the department was \"saddened\" by the incident and calling for further investigation into the shooting.\n\n\"I immediately placed the deputy on administrative leave and have asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to conduct the investigation that is required in such incidents,\" Aden said. \"The State Attorney's Office will also conduct an independent review. At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office declined to provide Military.com the original 911 call and the police report into the incident, citing \"the ongoing active investigation\" in an emailed response.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of bodycam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy. We urge authorities to immediately stop demonizing Roger in their statements to the media. It's imperative to correct the record and acknowledge the wrongful entry into Roger's home.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_novelly@businessinsider.com", "name": "Thomas Novelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Police radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_AC-130", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed AC-130"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okaloosa_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_can't_breathe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "I can't breathe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gunship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurlburt_Field", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurlburt Field"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military.com", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panhandle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panhandle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squadron_(aviation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squadron (aviation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medical services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Department_of_Law_Enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Department of Law Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrative leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/663d12cab4abc992e8c79567?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546267", "eventUri": "eng-9546267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-11-19", "textStart": 2962, "textEnd": 2979}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

What we know\n\nAn attorney from Crump's office said they have located \"an unofficial redacted 911 call\" that has led them to believe a disturbance had been reported to the leasing office at the Elan Apartment \"from what we believe to be a fourth party.\"\n\n\"We're telling the Sheriff's Office to be transparent, we're not going away until that transparency happens,\" said Brian Barr, an attorney from Pensacola's Levin Levin Papantonio Rafferty firm who is co-counseling in this case alongside Crump.\n\nTo hammer home the Sheriff's Office effort to turn attention away from the Fortson shooting, Barr pointed to the news release issued following the shooting. That release said the shooting took place \"after a deputy made contact with an armed individual at an apartment of Racetrack Road late Friday afternoon.\"\n\n\"Hearing sounds of a disturbance, he reacted in self defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun after the deputy identified himself as law enforcement,\" the release said.\n\n\"You read that statement, it makes you think this was outside, there was a disturbance and this kid was creating a scene,\" Barr said. \"They made it sound so convincing\" he told the assembled media, \"none of you covered it. It didn't get any attention. I didn't hear about it until this Tuesday, and I live here. This statement made people try to forget about Roger.\"\n\nAttorney Ben Crump, family to meet with Sheriff\n\nThe Sheriff's Office has continued since the shooting to say little about the incident. According to Crump, his fellow lawyers and the Fortson family would review body cam footage of the shooting at noon today. The Sheriff's Office has scheduled a press conference of its own for 2 p.m.\n\nCrump said the girlfriend, who has hired an attorney and is staying out of the public eye for now, has told him \"she heard everything\" that happened inside Fortson's apartment on the afternoon of the shooting.\n\nShe said Fortson was startled by an aggressive pounding on the door of the apartment, but when he peered through the peep hole could see no one on the other side, so he went and retrieved his legally registered gun.\n\n\"She just heard shots and he was on the ground, they just said 'he's shot up'\" Meka Fortson interjected, sobbing, as Crump spoke. \"My baby was shot up.\"\n\n\"Obviously you can see how devastated the family is,\" Crump continued. \"And as he was laying on the ground saying 'I can't breathe' they seemed to go through the apartment saying 'county sheriff, reveal yourself' while he was struggling to breathe.\"\n\nMore: Falling acorn spooks Florida deputy who fired into his own car, then resigned. Watch the video\n\nFortson, who had been shot six times, died from his injuries after being taken to a local hospital.\n\nMeka Fortson said the girlfriend had called her following the shooting and she had traveled from Atlanta to see him. She said Sheriff's Office investigators never told her that her son had died, only that his shooting was \"under investigation.\"\n\nRoger Fortson 'living his dream'\n\nShe called Roger Fortson the backbone of her family who had enlisted in the military after graduating high school to work toward his dream of buying her a home.\n\n\"He was living his dream, he was going to make life better for his mother and family,\" she said.\n\nHe was also well respected by his military superiors and colleagues, she said.\n\n\"Everybody has told us what a respectable young man he was,\" Meka Fortson said, adding that he would have had too much respect for law enforcement officers to confront them.\n\nCrump said the specific purpose of gathering the media Thursday was to call for steps to be taken to clear Roger Fortson's name.\n\n\"The purpose of this news conference is to demand that Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office do the right thing and correct this narrative,\" he said. \"Don't put a stain on the name of this young man. \"", "source": {"uri": "eu.pnj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pensacola News Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okaloosa_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_can't_breathe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "I can't breathe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/09/PPEN/73629327007-img-11101.JPG?auto=webp&crop=3024,1701,x-1,y385&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546267", "eventUri": "eng-9546267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 276, "textEnd": 281}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- A Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman inside his apartment in the state's Panhandle, body camera video shown to reporters Thursday shows.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys held a news conference in which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe video from the deputy's body camera showed that Fortson answered his apartment door with what appears to be handgun pointed down toward the floor. The video shows the deputy banging on the door, stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. Twice he shouted: \"Sheriff's office!\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe door opened, and the deputy shouted, \"Step back!\" The deputy then fired off shots, and shouted, \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Do not move!\" The deputy then called for paramedics on his radio.\n\nNoted civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, earlier had asked the sheriff's office for transparency and disputed the narrative authorities released following the May 3 shooting. An email was sent to Crump's office Thursday afternoon seeking comment about what the bodycam footage showed and the sheriff's describing as inaccurate Crump's statements that the deputy went to the wrong apartment and didn't announce himself.\n\nAlden is seen on the video arriving at an apartment building and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nCrump told reporters earlier that Fortson had grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment, got no response when he asked who was there and discovered the peephole on his door was blocked.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting.\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death inside his Fort Walton Beach apartment.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"He was just in his apartment, minding his businesses,\" Crump said. \"They could have made sure they were at the right apartment. They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door.\"\n\nIn a statement last week, the sheriff's office said a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times and died at a hospital. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson was talking to his girlfriend, who hasn't yet been identified, on FaceTime when deputies burst into his apartment on May 3, Crump added.\n\nWithout her, his family wouldn't have known what happened, he said. The girlfriend notified his mother, who drove to Fort Walton Beach to find out that her son was dead.\n\nAt the hospital, deputies approached Chantemekki Fortson, and she told them, \"'You guys have killed my baby. Just take me to my baby please. I just want to see my child,'\" she recounted at the news conference.\n\n\"They had taken my gift,\" she said. \"My heart is bleeding, and they wanted to talk to me. They told me the investigation was ongoing,\" she said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nSchneider reported from Orlando, Fla.\n\n___\n\nThe spelling of the name of Fortson's mother has been corrected to

He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump's statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's claims. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\n____", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern California"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer",

They killed a good guy. They took from his mama a good guy. They took from his brother and sister a good guy. They took from his father a good guy.

It did not provide any additional information, citing the active investigation.\n\nThe state attorney's office is also conducting an independent review, the sheriff's office said.\n\nSheriff Eric Aden said in a statement that \"all of us at the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office are saddened about the fatal officer involved shooting over the weekend.\"\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" he said.\n\nHurlburt Field, the Air Force base where Fortson was assigned, said in a statement that Fortson entered active duty on Nov. 19, 2019.

(AP) -- A Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman inside his apartment in the state's Panhandle, according to body camera video shown to reporters Thursday.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys held a news conference in which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense. Aden rejected assertions made by civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, that the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment, covered the door's peephole and did not announce himself.\n\nThe video shows the deputy arriving at a Fort Walton Beach apartment building on May 3 and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nThe video shows the deputy banging on the door and stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. Twice he shouted: \"Sheriff's office! Open the door!\"\n\nFortson opened the door and could be seen holding what appeared to be handgun pointed down toward the floor. The deputy shouted, \"Step back!\" and fired off shots. He then shouted, \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun!\"\n\n\"It's over there,\" Fortson said.\n\n\"Drop the gun!\" the deputy yelled back.\n\n\"I don't have it,\" Fortson said, lying on the ground.\n\nThe deputy then called paramedics on his radio.\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputy or his race. The deputy was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump released a statement later noting that the officer did not tell Roger to drop his gun before shooting \"multiple times within a split second of the door being opened.\"\n\n\"We remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment,\" the statement said.\n\nCrump also told reporters earlier that Fortson was talking to his girlfriend on FaceTime and that he grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment. He said that the deputy burst into the apartment, citing the account of the girlfriend, who has not yet been identified.\n\n\"The girlfriend acknowledges that even though she initially thought the door was forced open by the police that she stands by her emotional recollection of what happened,\" Crump's later statement said.\n\nAden said he had met with the family before showing the video to reporters and extended his deepest condolences.\n\n\"This result is one we never hope to encounter,\" Aden said. \"These investigations take time, but I want to assure you that we are not hiding or attempting to cover anything up.\"\n\nOfficials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating. FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nThe sheriff said the probe was being handled as a criminal investigation and that no determination had yet been made on whether the deputy's actions were justified or not. However, the initial news release from the sheriff's office that described the shooting said that the deputy \"reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun.\"\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times.\n\nHe said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nSchneider reported from Orlando, Fla.\n\nThe spelling of the name of Fortson's mother has been corrected to Chantemekki instead of Chantimekki.", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@theadvocate.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

She said he had recently returned from a deployment overseas, only to die in his apartment.\n\n\"It's a disbelief. Every day, I try to go to sleep early to wake up like it's a dream,\" she told Military.com. \"He just came back from deployment from fighting for us. With everything we got going on in our country, he's fighting for us and he came back to be murdered, slain like that so violently.\"\n\nRead Next: Police Who Shot Florida Airman 6 Times in His Home May Have Entered Wrong Apartment, Family Says\n\nRoger Fortson lived in an off-base residence in Fort Walton Beach. His special operations squadron at Hurlburt Field in the Florida panhandle flies AC-130J Ghostrider gunships.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said in a May 4 statement that deputies were responding to a reported disturbance.\n\nBut Ben Crump, a high-profile civil rights attorney retained by the Fortson family, said there was no disturbance and that Fortson was home alone May 3, chatting on a video call with another person, who told the attorney that the airman heard a knock on his door.\n\nRoger Fortson, according to the witness, asked, \"Who is it?\" But he didn't receive an answer. After a subsequent \"aggressive\" second knock and seeing no one through the peephole, Fortson grabbed his legally owned gun, Crump said.\n\nThe Sunshine State has made it easier to buy and carry firearms in recent years, and has created special carve-outs for service members that simplify the process further, such as not requiring troops to take safety courses in order to qualify to carry concealed weapons under a 2023 law.\n\nFortson was a service member, in his own residence and had no criminal record, Crump said.\n\nIn a May 4 statement, the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said, \"Hearing sounds of a disturbance, [the deputy] reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun and after the deputy had identified himself as law enforcement.\"\n\nCrump pushed back against that narrative and told Military.com no gunfire was exchanged and that Fortson was a model citizen who did not pose a threat.\n\n\"The reality is he was the best of us. He was the person who you would trust with a firearm. I mean, he was military trained,\" Crump said. \"So, for them to put out a statement claiming self-defense is just misleading because they're trying to suggest that what they did was justified.\"\n\nAs Fortson was walking back to his living room, police entered the apartment and shot him. He reportedly said \"I can't breathe\" while on the ground after being shot, Crump said, repeating a witness account of the event.\n\nPolice radio audio reviewed by Military.com reported a call for a disturbance at an apartment complex at 319 Racetrack Road around 4:30 p.m. local time.\n\n\"Don't have anything further than a male and female; it's all fourth-party information from the front desk at the leasing office,\" a deputy said on the radio.\n\nA few minutes later, another deputy reported \"shots fired, suspect down,\" and called for emergency medical services.\n\n\"Multiple gunshot wounds to the chest, Black male,\" another deputy chimes in shortly after. Fortson was shot six times, Crump said in his statement.\n\nNo other details, including the circumstances of the disturbance that prompted the local deputies to visit the apartment building, were released. Fortson was taken to an area hospital, where he later died. No officers were harmed in the incident.\n\nThe sheriff's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the attorney's claims. The same sheriff's office received public scrutiny when an internal investigation detailed that a deputy fired his weapon multiple times at a detained suspect after believing the sound of an acorn hitting his vehicle was gunfire, GulfLive.com reported. That deputy resigned.\n\nCrump told Military.com that he wants the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office to admit that it did something wrong and criticized the deputies, saying they didn't identify themselves when they came to Roger's apartment.\n\n\"All he did was what many law-abiding, responsible American citizens would have done,\" Crump said. \"And that is when you hear somebody at your door, and you are not sure who it is because you don't hear them identify themselves, you get your legally registered firearm for protection.\"\n\nFortson joined the Air Force on Nov. 19, 2019, according to a copy of his service record provided to Military.com. He joined as an AC-130J gunner. He graduated from McNair High School in Atlanta, Georgia, with honors, Crump told Military.com.\n\nThe deputy involved was not identified in the news release.\n\nOn Monday evening, Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden released a statement saying the department was \"saddened\" by the incident and called for further investigation into the shooting.\n\n\"I immediately placed the deputy on administrative leave and have asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to conduct the investigation that is required in such incidents,\" Aden said. \"The State Attorney's Office will also conduct an independent review. At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office declined to provide Military.com the original 911 call, body camera footage or the police report into the incident, citing \"the ongoing active investigation\" in an emailed response.\n\nFollowing his death, Roger's mother has received kind words from those who served alongside him. She described him as a rising star in the ranks and an inspiration to his 16-year-old brother and 10-year-old sister.\n\n\"He was my gift, and they took my gift away,\" Roger's mother said. \"And they didn't give it to me. God gave me that gift ... and they took my gift away.\"", "source": {"uri": "military.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Military"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_novelly@military.com", "name": "Thomas

The shooting occurred on the afternoon of May 3, when a deputy with the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office went to the apartment complex, entered the unit and opened fire, according to a statement from Sheriff Eric Aden.\n\nSix shots hit Roger Fortson, 23, a senior Air Force airman who was at home in his apartment, according to attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family. The sheriff said the deputy heard sounds of a disturbance and reacted in self-defense after he encountered an armed man. The sheriff did not name Fortson in his statement or give any more detail on the incident.\n\nThe sheriff's office did not return calls to comment on whether deputies had gone to Fortson's apartment by mistake, nor to corroborate details of what Crump said had taken place on the afternoon Fortson was killed. During a news conference on Thursday, Crump said Fortson was on a Facetime call with his girlfriend after he just got home from playing video games with his friends. When he heard a knock on his door, he asked, \"Who is it?\" but didn't get a response, according to the girlfriend.\n\nFortson then retrieved a gun he owned legally and was walking back into his living room when the deputy burst through the door and opened fire, Crump said, citing the girlfriend. Fortson did not fire his weapon, the lawyer said. \"He was in his apartment minding his business and then ... this cascade of tragic events started to take place,\" he said, calling on the sheriff to release police body-camera footage.\n\nThe killing is reminiscent of an unannounced police raid in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2020, when police burst into the apartment of Breonna Taylor, a Black 26-year-old emergency medical technician, killing her. Police had obtained a \"no knock\" warrant to raid the apartment, mistaking it for the home of a suspect. Taylor's death, along with the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police weeks later, set off a worldwide wave of protests against racism in law enforcement in the summer of 2020.\n\nAfter Fortson was shot, he was taken to a hospital where he died from his wounds. The deputy must have gone to the wrong apartment as there was no disturbance at Fortson's residence and he was alone, Crump said.\n\n\"They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door,\" he said, noting that the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by police. Crump said Fortson always dreamt of becoming a pilot, describing him as a patriot and a good young man who followed rules and respected authority.\n\n\"My baby was my everything,\" his mother said during the news conference, demanding full transparency from the sheriff's office as she held a photograph of her son. \"Tell the truth about my son ... please clean his reputation.\" The deputy, who has not been identified, was placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, the sheriff said. He did not specify who was conducting the investigation.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okaloosa_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Breonna_Taylor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Breonna Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medical technician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Administrative leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_06_33_8443168.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546267", "eventUri": "eng-9546267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 297, "textEnd": 302}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 1848, "textEnd": 1858}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

He was a responsible young man who respected authority, they said, and he'd hoped to buy his mother and younger siblings a house.\n\nThey urged law enforcement to release more information about the shooting, saying that the narrative put forward so far suggested Fortson had done something wrong.\n\n\"To the sheriff's department that took my gift ... I need you guys to tell the truth about my son. I need you to get his reputation right,\" Fortson's mother said.\n\n\"I know my son did not do anything to you guys.

The deputy then allegedly burst into the apartment and shot Fortson.\n\nThe witness said law enforcement responded to the wrong apartment, and there was no disturbance there at the time, Crump said in the news release. According to Crump, the witness said Fortson was alone at the time.\n\nDeputies communicated with dispatch that Fortson had been shot six times with multiple gunshot wounds to the chest with one exit wound, according to police dispatch calls, obtained by CNN affiliate WEAR.\n\nOfficers can be heard saying that there was a \"disturbance ... physical in progress,\" in the dispatch calls, WEAR reported.\n\n\"Fortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron. He entered active duty on Nov. 19, 2019,\" said a statement from the Air Force, which noted the shooting occurred at Fortson's off-base residence.\n\n\"The 1st Special Operations Wing's priorities are providing casualty affairs service to the family, supporting the squadron during this tragic time, and ensuring resources are available for all who are impacted,\" said the Hurlburt Field statement.\n\nShooting calls to mind past incidents\n\nWhile details about the shooting remain murky, the allegation the Okaloosa deputy responded to the wrong apartment echoes other shootings in recent years, in which a Black man or woman was killed by law enforcement in their home.\n\nIn 2019, a former Dallas police officer was sentenced to 10 years in prison after fatally shooting Botham Jean in his apartment the year prior. The officer - off duty but still in uniform - lived on the floor below Jean's and said she approached what she believed to be her own apartment when she saw Jean inside.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson was killed that same year when a Fort Worth officer, responding to what police believed to be a burglary, shot her through her bedroom window.\n\nThe officer testified at trial that Jefferson pointed a gun at him, but prosecutors argued there was no evidence he saw the gun before opening fire. The former Fort Worth officer was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison in 2022.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

When he asked who was there, there was no verbal response but a more \"aggressive knock\" on the door came a few minutes later.\n\nFortson didn't see anyone when he checked through the peephole and grabbed his legally-registered firearm as a precaution. A few minutes later, police barged through the door, saw Fortson's gun, and allegedly shot him six times while his girlfriend remained on the video call.\n\n\"I can't breathe,\" Fortson said after being shot, the press release stated.\n\nFortson was eventually taken to a hospital, where he died.\n\nHis mom Meka Fortson said she drove to Florida from Atlanta after she got a call from Fortson's girlfriend that he had been shot. She recalled that authorities were not initially very communicative with her about what happened or the status of her son's health.\n\n\"So, I walk through the [hospital] door. ... When I see three men in blue Air Force uniforms, that's when I knew my child was dead before any word was uttered,\" Meka Fortson said. \"The only thing those three men could tell me was how exceptional my child was.\"\n\nFortson enlisted with the U.S. Air Force after graduating from high school in Atlanta. He was his mother's third son out of five children, and did everything for the sake of his family, Crump said.\n\n\"[Fortson] was trying to help his family have a better life. His dream -- like so many young people who don't come with a silver spoon -- was to give his mother a home. He was trying to make sure his [siblings] knew that their big brother was going to make sure that they had a chance at the American dream, and that's why he was sacrificing so much for them,\" Crump added.\n\nFortson was injured during a tour in Kuwait and had plans of becoming a pilot.\n\n\"Roger Fortson was the best America had to offer,\" Crump said. \"He had always wanted to serve in the United States Air Force, and he was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and his siblings and his family so they could have a better chance at their American dream.\"\n\nIn a previous press release, the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said the department was responding to a \"call of disturbance\" when officers encountered Fortson.\n\nHowever, according to Fortson's girlfriend, he was alone in his apartment, there was no disturbance, and police had entered the wrong apartment.\n\nDuring Thursday's presser, attorney Ben Crump said the police had an idea that they may not have had the right location because they knocked on a series of doors before settling on Fortson's home.\n\n\"They have a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door,\" Crump said. \"[Fortson] was the good guy, and he did not deserve to be killed like this and then have these false narratives placed on his life, on his legacy. No, that's not American. That is un-American.\"\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office -- just outside of Pensacola -- previously said it was \"saddened about the fatal officer involved shooting.\"\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden said the deputy involved in the shooting was \"immediately placed... on administrative leave\" and asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said in the department's press release.\n\nIn February, an independent probe found that an officer from the same police department shot and handcuffed an unarmed man, the Washington Post reported. According to the investigation, the officer mistook a fallen acorn for a gunshot. The officer later resigned.\n\nOn Thursday, Crump said any law-abiding citizen \"should be troubled\" by Fortson's death and police officers' dismissal of him legally owning a gun in his own home.\n\n\"This truly is about the Constitution. ... When you think about the people who we want to have guns in America, [Fortson] is Exhibit A. I mean he was trained to use a firearm. He's a military trained officer. He's very responsible. He respects authority. He's very diplomatic,\" Crump said. \"He was protecting us so that we could have all those constitutional rights. ... [Fortson] was a patriot for all of us.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okaloosa_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_can't_breathe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "I can't breathe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Department_of_Law_Enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Department of Law Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensacola,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pensacola, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pensacola, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1700,w_3024,x_0,y_685/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1715275039/fam_a0fcz3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546267", "eventUri": "eng-9546267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 740, "textEnd": 745}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

An Air Force spokesperson told Task and Purpose he was a Special Missions Aviator assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron's AC-130J gunships.\n\nCrump said in a statement that Fortson was on a Facetime call with a woman at the time of the deadly incident. The woman, who has not been publicly identified, said that Fortson was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock at his door, according to Crump.\n\nCrump added that per the woman's account, Forston asked who was knocking but got no response. A few minutes later, he heard a louder knock and checked the people, but didn't see anyone.\n\nShe then said the victim grew concerned and retrieved his gun -- which Crump said Fortson legally owned.\n\nOnce he walked from the door to his living room, the deputies burst through the door and saw he was armed and shot him six times, said Crump.

The sheriff did not name Fortson in his statement.\n\nThe deputy, who has not been identified, was placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, the sheriff said. He did not specify who was conducting the investigation.\n\nThe killing is reminiscent of an unannounced police raid in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2020 when police burst into the apartment of Breonna Taylor, a Black 26-year-old emergency medical technician, killing her. Under questionable pretenses, police had obtained a \"no knock\" warrant to raid the apartment.\n\nTaylor's death, along with the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police weeks later, set off a worldwide wave of protests against racism in law enforcement in the summer of 2020.\n\nBefore the shooting, Crump said, Fortson was on a FaceTime call when he heard a knock on his door. He asked, \"who is it?\" but didn't get a response, according to Crump's statement.\n\n\"A few minutes later, there was a very aggressive knock on the door, but Roger didn't see anyone when he looked out the peephole,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson then retrieved his gun and was walking back into his living room when the deputies burst through the door and opened fire, Crump said. Fortson was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries.\n\nAccording to the person who was on the call with Fortson, police were in the wrong apartment as there was no disturbance in the apartment and he was alone, Crump said. The statement did not identify the person on the call.\n\n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Editing by Alistair Bell)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okaloosa_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Breonna_Taylor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Breonna Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medical technician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrative leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_O'Brien_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendan O'Brien (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546267", "eventUri": "eng-9546267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 307, "textEnd": 312}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 1139, "textEnd": 1149}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

His girlfriend, who was on a FaceTime call with him throughout the encounter, said that the deputy burst into the wrong unit and fatally shot Fortson when he saw he was armed with a gun, Fortson's mother and her attorneys said at a news conference. They said the girlfriend, who did not attend the news conference, was distraught.\n\n\"He lost his life because they knocked on the wrong door. Mistakes happen. We know that,\" said Brian Barr, one of the family's attorneys. \"Humans aren't perfect. Good people make mistakes. But good people also own their mistakes.\"\n\nHe said the sheriff's office, through its statement about the shooting, had misled the public.\n\n\"You go pick it up and read it. What's it make you think? It makes you think this happened outside. That this kid was in the middle of a disturbance,\" Barr said. \"And he did something. He instigated this and lost his life. That's what it makes it sound like. It sounded justified. That's what they tried to make it sound like.\"\n\n\"We want to know what happened,\" he continued. \"We want the mistakes to be owned. We're not going away until that transparency happens.\"\n\nIn its statement, the sheriff's office said: \"our deputy responded to a call of a disturbance in progress where he encountered an armed man. The deputy shot the man, who later succumbed to his injuries.\"\n\nCivil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is also representing Fortson's family, said that they planned to review the body camera video with members of the sheriff's office later Thursday and that he expected it to be released publicly thereafter.\n\n\"They took a good guy. They took a patriot from us,\" he said. \"Then to put out this narrative that the officer acted in self-defense. Put out this narrative demonizing his name as if he did something wrong. Trying to justify an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"When you make a mistake, you own up to it. You don't try to justify killing a good guy,\" Crump said. \"Okaloosa sheriff's office, they need to give him the dignity and respect he so richly deserved.\"\n\nFortson's mother, Chantimekki Fortson, held a framed photograph of her son in his uniform. She said he had aspired to be in the Air Force since he was a young boy and was living his dream. She described him as compassionate, intelligent, loving and respectful.\n\nShe implored the sheriff's department, which she said, \"took my gift,\" to release more information about the encounter.\n\n\"I need you to get his reputation right,\" Chantimekki Fortson said. \"Tell the truth about my son. I know my son didn't do anything to you guys. Please clean my baby's reputation.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Crump called the sheriff's office's account \"deeply troubling\" and said it falsely suggested Fortson had posed a threat.\n\nThe sheriff's office has said the deputy, who has not been publicly identified, heard \"sounds of a disturbance\" and \"reacted in self defense\" after he encountered Fortson armed with a gun and after he had identified himself as law enforcement. But Fortson's mother and her attorneys said that Fortson was on the FaceTime call with his girlfriend during the entire encounter and that he was home alone when he heard a knock at his door. He asked, \"Who is it?\" but didn't get a response, Crump said in a statement Wednesday and at the news conference.\n\nA few minutes later, there was a second aggressive knock, according to the girlfriend. Crump said Thursday that Fortson did not see anyone when he looked through the peephole and it appeared as if someone was covering it, citing the girlfriend. Fortson believed someone was attempting to break into his apartment, Barr said. So he retrieved his gun, which his family's attorneys said was legally owned. As he walked back through his living room, law enforcement burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to the girlfriend's account. He was taken to a hospital where he later died, the sheriff's office said.\n\nThe girlfriend said she saw Fortson on the ground saying, \"I can't breathe\" after he was shot. She said she believed law enforcement had burst into the wrong unit, because there was no disturbance in Fortson's apartment and he was home alone.\n\nChantimekki Fortson said her son's girlfriend called her while she was still on the FaceTime call. The grieving mother said her son was shot three times in the chest and three times in the left arm.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron. Hurlburt Field, the Air Force base where he was assigned, said in a statement that he entered active duty Nov. 19, 2019.\n\nIn a statement late Tuesday, Sheriff Eric Aden said he \"immediately\" placed the deputy on administrative leave and asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to conduct an investigation, as required by policy. He said the Florida State Attorney's Office would also conduct an independent review.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement confirmed it was investigating the shooting at the request of the sheriff's office and declined to comment further. The Florida State Attorney's Office did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nCrump compared Fortson's killing to that of Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man who was shot and killed in 2018 by a white, off-duty Dallas police officer who mistook his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger was found guilty of murder the following year and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\n\"You come into my apartment, you shoot and kill me and then you say it was self-defense?\" Crump said. \"How does that make any sense.\"\n\nCrump represented Jean's family, as well as the families of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, who were also killed by police.", "source": {"uri":

The killing is reminiscent of an unannounced police raid in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2020 when police burst into the apartment of Breonna Taylor, a Black 26-year-old emergency medical technician, killing her. Under questionable pretenses, police had obtained a \"no knock\" warrant to raid the apartment.\n\nTaylor's death, along with the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police weeks later, set off a worldwide wave of protests against racism in law enforcement in the summer of 2020. Before the shooting, Crump said, Fortson was on a FaceTime call when he heard a knock on his door. He asked, \"who is it?\" but didn't get a response, according to Crump's statement.\n\n\"A few minutes later, there was a very aggressive knock on the door, but Roger didn't see anyone when he looked out the peephole,\" Crump said. Fortson then retrieved his gun and was walking back into his living room when the deputies burst through the door and opened fire, Crump said. Fortson was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries.\n\nAccording to the person who was on the call with Fortson, police were in the wrong apartment as there was no disturbance in the apartment and he was alone, Crump said. The statement did not identify the person on the call.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okaloosa_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aden", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrative leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Breonna_Taylor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Killing of Breonna Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medical technician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_05_15_9474824.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546267", "eventUri": "eng-9546267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 42, "textEnd": 47, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 1552, "textEnd": 1562}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Late Friday afternoon, our deputy responded to a call of a disturbance in progress where he encountered an armed man,\" Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n\"The deputy shot the man, who later succumbed to his injuries. I immediately placed the deputy on administrative leave and have asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to conduct the investigation that is required in such incidents. The State Attorney's Office will also conduct an independent review.\"\n\nAden asked the community for patience \"as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event.\"\n\nAt a press conference Thursday, civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump, representing Fortson's family, called the airman assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron \"a patriot.\" He urged the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office not to \"stain\" his name with their narrative.\n\nCrump called for transparency in the case and urged the police to release the body cam footage of the shooting. The sheriff's office released the footage Thursday.\n\nAccording to CBS News, the video shows a deputy knocking on Fortson's apartment door and announcing that he is with the sheriff's office. When the door opens, the deputy is seen yelling for Fortson to step back. Within seconds, the deputy shot Fortson. The deputy then tells Fortson to drop his gun while he is lying on the ground. But Fortson is heard telling the deputy that he doesn't have the gun. The officer tells Fortson not to move as he calls for emergency medical help before the video ends.\n\n\"It pains me to show the video, but I know that you all need to see it,\" Aden was quoted as saying.\n\nCrump said a witness, identified as Fortson's girlfriend, was on Facetime with the airman for the entirety of the encounter. She stated that Fortson was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock on his door.\n\nWhen he asked, \"Who is it?\" he didn't get a response, she said. A few minutes later, there was another knock, she added, but this time it was very aggressive. Fortson looked through his peephole and saw no one, so he retrieved his legally owned gun as a precaution.\n\nAs he was walking back to his living room, the girlfriend said police officers broke through his door and shot him six times when they saw that he was armed.\n\nHis girlfriend said she saw him on the ground saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot. Fortson was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.\n\nFortson's girlfriend believes the police may have entered the wrong apartment as there was no disturbance at his apartment prior to the shooting.\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, said at Thursday's press conference that her son's girlfriend was devastated by his killing.\n\n\"She literally watched them walk over him as he was dying, taking his last breath,\" the grieving mother said.\n\nAttorney Brian Barr of the Levin Papantonio Rafferty Law Firm, who is also representing the family, said the airman did nothing wrong.\n\n\"All he was doing was sitting in his house, sitting in his house. My Lord, every one of us sit in our houses every day, and every one of us, if somebody we don't know comes into our house, are going to defend ourselves,\" Barr said. \"Every single one of us.

Drop the gun! Do not move!\" The deputy then called for paramedics on his radio.\n\nNoted civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, earlier had asked the sheriff's office for transparency and disputed the narrative authorities released following the May 3 shooting. An email was sent to Crump's office Thursday afternoon seeking comment about what the bodycam footage showed and the sheriff's describing as inaccurate Crump's statements that the deputy went to the wrong apartment and didn't announce himself.\n\nAlden is seen on the video arriving at an apartment building and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nCrump told reporters earlier that Fortson had grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment, got no response when he asked who was there and discovered the peephole on his door was blocked.\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting.\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death inside his Fort Walton Beach apartment.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"He was just in his apartment, minding his businesses,\" Crump said. \"They could have made sure they were at the right apartment. They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door.\"\n\nIn a statement last week, the sheriff's office said a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times and died at a hospital. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson was talking to his girlfriend, who hasn't yet been identified, on FaceTime when deputies burst into his apartment on May 3, Crump added.\n\nWithout her, his family wouldn't have known what happened, he said. The girlfriend notified his mother, who drove to Fort Walton Beach to find out that her son was dead.\n\nAt the hospital, deputies approached Chantemekki Fortson, and she told them, \"'You guys have killed my baby. Just take me to my baby please. I just want to see my child,'\" she recounted at the news conference.\n\n\"They had taken my gift,\" she said. \"My heart is bleeding, and they wanted to talk to me. They told me the investigation was ongoing,\" she said.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nThe spelling of the name of Fortson's mother has been corrected to Chantemekki instead of Chantimekki.\n\nStephen Smith And Mike Schneider, The

According to the account shared by the woman on the call, Fortson went to answer a knock on his door but found no one outside. Concerned, he retrieved his legally owned firearm for protection. Moments later, deputies burst through the door and, upon seeing Fortson armed, shot him six times.\n\nThe Facetime caller reported hearing Fortson's last words, \"I can't breathe,\" Crump shared.

The shooting occurred on the afternoon of May 3, when a deputy with the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office went to the apartment complex, entered the unit and opened fire, according to a statement from Sheriff Eric Aden.\n\nSix shots hit Roger Fortson, 23, a senior Air Force airman who was stationed nearby, according to attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family. The sheriff said the deputy heard sounds of a disturbance and reacted in self defense after he encountered the 23-year-old. The sheriff did not name Fortson in his statement.\n\nDuring a news conference on Thursday, Crump said Fortson was on a Facetime call with his girlfriend after he just got home from playing video games with his friends. When he heard a knock on his door, he asked, \"Who is it?\" but didn't get a response. Fortson then retrieved a gun he owned legally and was walking back into his living room when the deputies burst through the door and opened fire. Fortson did not fire his weapon, Crump said.\n\n\"He was in his apartment minding his business and then ... this cascade of tragic events started to take place,\" he said, calling on the sheriff to release body-camera footage. The killing is reminiscent of an unannounced police raid in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2020, when police burst into the apartment of Breonna Taylor, a Black 26-year-old emergency medical technician, killing her. Under questionable pretenses, police had obtained a \"no knock\" warrant to raid the apartment.\n\nTaylor's death, along with the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police weeks later, set off a worldwide wave of protests against racism in law enforcement in the summer of 2020. After Fortson was shot, he was taken to a hospital where he died from his wounds.\n\nThe deputy went to the wrong apartment as there was no disturbance at Fortson's residence and he was alone, Crump said. \"They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door,\" he said, noting that the U.S. Constitution protected against unreasonable searches and seizures by police.\n\nCrump said Fortson always dreamt of becoming a pilot, describing him as a patriot and a good young man who followed rules and respected authority. \"My baby was my everything,\" his mother said during the news conference, demanding full transparency from the sheriff's office as she held a photograph of her son. \"Tell the truth about my son ... please clean his reputation.\"\n\nThe deputy, who has not been identified, was placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, the sheriff said. He did not specify who was conducting the investigation.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

The sheriff did not name Fortson in his statement.\n\nThe deputy, who has not been identified, was placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, the sheriff said. He did not specify who was conducting the investigation.\n\nThe killing is reminiscent of an unannounced police raid in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2020 when police burst into the apartment of Breonna Taylor, a Black 26-year-old emergency medical technician, killing her. Under questionable pretenses, police had obtained a \"no knock\" warrant to raid the apartment.\n\nTaylor's death, along with the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police weeks later, set off a worldwide wave of protests against racism in law enforcement in the summer of 2020.\n\nBefore the shooting, Crump said, Fortson was on a FaceTime call when he heard a knock on his door. He asked, \"who is it?\" but didn't get a response, according to Crump's statement.\n\n\"A few minutes later, there was a very aggressive knock on the door, but Roger didn't see anyone when he looked out the peephole,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson then retrieved his gun and was walking back into his living room when the deputies burst through the door and opened fire, Crump said. Fortson was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries.\n\nAccording to the person who was on the call with Fortson, police were in the wrong apartment as there was no disturbance in the apartment and he was alone, Crump said. The statement did not identify the person on the call.\n\n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Editing by Alistair Bell)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Fortson also tried to look through his front door's peephole, but \"it was as if somebody was covering up the peephole so he couldn't see out of it,\" Crump said at a press conference on Thursday. In the footage, the deputy can be seen knocking on the door, before stepping away where he could not be seen from the door's peephole..The deputy can be heard saying \"Sheriff's Office open the door\" twice, and Fortson can be heard saying something inaudible -- that the Sheriff's Office is claiming was him saying \"police\" -- before opening the door to the deputy. The deputy says \"step back\" before drawing his weapon and firing at Fortson, who appears to have his weapon at his side and not drawn on the officer. Crump's office, citing the witness, alleged the deputy \"burst through the door\" and shot Fortson six times in the chest and arm after they saw the airman was armed -- this was disputed by the Sheriff's Office, whose video showed Fortson answered the door. Crump said Fortson's girlfriend heard three gunshots, then heard the deputy say \"drop your weapon\" before another round of shots. The video shows the officer fire five rounds at once before saying \"drop the gun,\" to which Fortson replies \"I don't have it\" and \"it's over there,\" before cutting out after the deputy calls EMS -- it's unclear if a sixth shot was fired.\n\nIn an original press release Friday, the Sheriff's Office said the deputy \"reacted in self defense\" and \"identified himself as law enforcement\" -- but the sheriff's updated statement on Tuesday did not repeat those claims. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, Arden said the deputy did announce himself and that Crump's assessment was \"inaccurate.\" \"We are aware of a press release and other comments that falsely state our deputy entered the wrong apartment and imply that they burst through the door into Mr. Fortson's residence,\" Arden said. \"What we do know at this time is that the deputy did announce himself -- not once, but twice. Mr. Fortson's comments indicate that he did acknowledge it was law enforcement at the door, and he arrived at the door with a firearm in his hand. The deputy knocked at the correct door, he did not cover the peephole or otherwise obscure its view in any way.\" However, it is difficult to hear exactly what Forston said, and the deputy did stand away from the door so that the person inside the apartment could not see who knocked. Arden said that the Fortson family \"have my word -- if this shooting is found to be unjustified, their son's name will be fully vindicated, and justice will be served.\" Arden did not answer any questions from the media.\n\n\"The narrative released by law enforcement, which falsely suggests that Roger posed a threat, is deeply troubling and inconsistent with the details: Roger was home alone, causing no disturbance, when his life was tragically cut short by law enforcement,\" Crump said in a statement posted on social media.\n\nCrump also said other deputies were knocking on other doors in the complex, adding that \"they had to know that it was questionable if this was the apartment or not.\" That was not seen in the video footage released by the Sheriff's Office on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Crump, Fortson \"enlisted in the military after graduating from high school with honors and had no criminal record. By all accounts, he was a stellar member of the Air Force and loved by his community.\" He was originally from the Atlanta area, and graduated from McNair High School in DeKalb County, Georgia, local station 11Alive reported. Fortson, a senior airman at the time of his death, entered active duty in November 2019 was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron based out of Hurlburt Field. The unit flies Block 30 AC-130J Ghostrider gunships and is currently supporting Operation Inherent Resolve -- the Pentagon's operation to support regional allies after the defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Fortson's mother, Meka Fortson, appeared alongside Crump, clutching a framed photo of her son in his uniform, as well as other members of his family. Crump and Fortson's mother confirmed that he was also injured while serving a tour of duty in Kuwait.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okaloosa_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medical services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_Special_Operations_Squadron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "4th Special Operations Squadron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Inherent_Resolve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operation Inherent Resolve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_AC-130", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed AC-130"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gunship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurlburt_Field", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hurlburt Field"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WXIA-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WXIA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_metropolitan_area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta metropolitan area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeKalb_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeKalb County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "DeKalb County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/663ce5b62aadbc108b3ba92a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3744,2106,x0,y695,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546267", "eventUri": "eng-9546267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-11-", "textStart": 4233, "textEnd": 4246}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- A Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman inside his apartment in the state's Panhandle, body camera video shown to reporters Thursday shows.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys held a news conference in which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense.\n\nThe video from the deputy's body camera showed that Fortson answered his apartment door with what appears to be handgun pointed down toward the floor. The video shows the deputy banging on the door, stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. Twice he shouted: \"Sheriff's office!\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Schemenauer\n\nThe door opened, and the deputy shouted, \"Step back!\" The deputy then fired off shots, and shouted, \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Do not move!\" The deputy then called for paramedics on his radio.\n\nNoted civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, earlier had asked the sheriff's office for transparency and disputed the narrative authorities released following the May 3 shooting. An email was sent to Crump's office Thursday afternoon seeking comment about what the bodycam footage showed and the sheriff's describing as inaccurate Crump's statements that the deputy went to the wrong apartment and didn't announce himself.\n\nAlden is seen on the video arriving at an apartment building and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nCrump told reporters earlier that Fortson had grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment, got no response when he asked who was there and discovered the peephole on his door was blocked.\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting.\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death inside his Fort Walton Beach apartment.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"He was just in his apartment, minding his businesses,\" Crump said. \"They could have made sure they were at the right apartment. They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door.\"\n\nIn a statement last week, the sheriff's office said a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times and died at a hospital. The deputy who shot him was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\n\"He was living his dream. By doing so, he was going to make it better for his mother and siblings so they could have a better chance at the American dream,\" Crump said.\n\nFortson was talking to his girlfriend, who hasn't yet been identified, on FaceTime when deputies burst into his apartment on May 3, Crump added.\n\nWithout her, his family wouldn't have known what happened, he said. The girlfriend notified his mother, who drove to Fort Walton Beach to find out that her son was dead.\n\nAt the hospital, deputies approached Chantemekki Fortson, and she told them, \"'You guys have killed my baby. Just take me to my baby please. I just want to see my child,'\" she recounted at the news conference.\n\n\"They had taken my gift,\" she said. \"My heart is bleeding, and they wanted to talk to me. They told me the investigation was ongoing,\" she said.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nIn November 2023, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's deputy mistook the sound of an acorn hitting his patrol vehicle for a gunshot and fired multiple times at the SUV where a handcuffed Black man was sitting in the backseat. Sheriff's officials said the man, who was being questioned about stealing his girlfriend's car, was not injured. He was taken into custody, but released without being charged. The officer who initiated the shooting resigned.\n\nSchneider reported from Orlando, Fla.\n\nThe spelling of the name of Fortson's mother has been corrected to Chantemekki instead of Chantimekki.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

After another \"very aggressive knock,\" Fortson looked out the peephole and could not see anyone. He was concerned, the statement said, and retrieved a gun, which he owned legally.\n\nAs Fortson returned to the living room with the gun, the authorities allegedly burst through the door and shot him six times. The witness recalled Fortson saying \"I can't breathe\" after he was shot. He died at a hospital.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office said in a statement released Tuesday that a deputy was responding to a \"call of a disturbance in progress\" when he \"encountered an armed man,\" whom the deputy shot.\n\nCrump said in the statement that the authorities' telling of the incident \"falsely suggests that Roger posed a threat\" and is \"deeply troubling.\"\n\n\"It's imperative to correct the record and acknowledge the wrongful entry into Roger's home,\" he said, calling for transparency in the investigation and the immediate release of body-cam footage to Fortson's family.\n\nThe Florida Attorney General's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday evening.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden said in a statement that he placed the deputy on administrative leave and asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to conduct a review.\n\nFortson enlisted in 2019 and served as a special mission aviator with the 4th Special Operations Squadron, the Air Force said, including as a gunner on the AC-130J, a workhorse aircraft in Special Operations. His decorations include an Air Medal with \"C\" Device, according to his service record, indicating that he served in a combat environment.\n\nThe Black community is saddened over the killing, and anger is starting to boil over as few questions are being answered by authorities, said Sabu Williams, an Air Force veteran and president of the Okaloosa County branch of the NAACP.\n\nWilliams said he has met with military and law enforcement officials to learn more about the incident, but that details on why the deputy arrived at Fortson's door, who opened it and what circumstances led to the shooting remain unclear or ambiguously described by the sheriff's office.\n\n\"There are issues with this incident,\" he said. \"Issues I think will probably not fare well for the deputy involved.\"\n\nNicole Hodskins, an Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office spokesperson, said police shootings are typically referred to state law enforcement investigators but did not respond to a request to provide recent examples.\n\nThe Washington Post on Tuesday requested body-camera footage from deputies involved and the incident report filed after the shooting. A representative of the records office said the report is \"still in the process of being completed.\" The sheriff's department will release the footage Thursday afternoon, a spokesperson said.\n\nAccording to internal investigation documents released in February, a law enforcement officer from the same sheriff's office shot at an unarmed and handcuffed man in November after he mistook the sound of a falling acorn for a gunshot. While the investigation concluded that the deputy used excessive force, there were no criminal charges filed, and the deputy resigned before the public release of the findings.\n\nPolice violence against Black Americans has sparked mass protests over the past decade, including the Black Lives Matter movement, in response to the killings of such individuals as Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor and others. Public outcry reached a fever pitch in 2020 after George Floyd's fatal interaction with police.\n\nAccording to The Post's database of fatal police shootings from 2015 to April this year, police killed the highest number of people on record in 2023, and Black Americans are killed by police at more than twice the rate of White Americans.\n\nFortson joined the military after graduating from high school with honors and did not have a criminal record, Crump's office said in the statement. \"By all accounts, he was a stellar member of the Air Force and loved by his community,\" Crump wrote of Fortson.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score":

After noticing Fortson was armed, officers allegedly shot him six times.\n\n\"The witness has said that she saw Roger on the ground stating, 'I can't breathe,' after he was shot,\" Crump said. \"She has also said the police were in the wrong apartment as there was no disturbance in the apartment and he was alone.\"\n\nRoger was later declared dead in a hospital.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump stated, as reported by the Associated Press.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump added. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nAt the sheriff's department's request, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced that it is looking into the shooting. Awaiting the results of the inquiry, the deputy who was shot was put on administrative leave.\n\n\"All of us at the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office are saddened about the fatal officer involved shooting over the weekend,\" said sheriff Eric Aden in a statement. \"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" he added.\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, an independent assessment is also being carried out by the state attorney's office.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Fortson's murder bear remarkable resemblance to those of other Black individuals who were slain by police in their homes in recent years, when the cops had responded to the incorrect location or had used wanton use of fatal force in response to service calls.\n\nBreonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home in 2020 during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend, and Ahmaud Arbery are just a few of the high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people in which Crump, a well-known attorney based in Florida, has been involved.", "source": {"uri": "lavocedinewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The sheriff did not name Fortson in his statement.\n\nDuring a news conference on Thursday, Crump said Fortson was on a Facetime call with his girlfriend after he just got home from playing video games with his friends. When he heard a knock on his door, he asked, \"Who is it?\" but didn't get a response.\n\nFortson then retrieved a gun he owned legally and was walking back into his living room when the deputies burst through the door and opened fire. Fortson did not fire his weapon, Crump said.\n\n\"He was in his apartment minding his business and then ... this cascade of tragic events started to take place,\" he said, calling on the sheriff to release body-camera footage.\n\nThe killing is reminiscent of an unannounced police raid in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2020, when police burst into the apartment of Breonna Taylor, a Black 26-year-old emergency medical technician, killing her. Under questionable pretenses, police had obtained a \"no knock\" warrant to raid the apartment.\n\nTaylor's death, along with the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police weeks later, set off a worldwide wave of protests against racism in law enforcement in the summer of 2020.\n\nAfter Fortson was shot, he was taken to a hospital where he died from his wounds.\n\nThe deputy went to the wrong apartment as there was no disturbance at Fortson's residence and he was alone, Crump said.\n\n\"They had a duty to make sure they were at the right apartment before they busted in the door,\" he said, noting that the U.S. Constitution protected against unreasonable searches and seizures by police.\n\nCrump said Fortson always dreamt of becoming a pilot, describing him as a patriot and a good young man who followed rules and respected authority.\n\n\"My baby was my everything,\" his mother said during the news conference, demanding full transparency from the sheriff's office as she held a photograph of her son. \"Tell the truth about my son ... please clean his reputation.\"\n\nThe deputy, who has not been identified, was placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation, the sheriff said. He did not specify who was conducting the investigation.\n\n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Editing by Alistair Bell and Bill Berkot)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

When they arrived on the scene, they were so jacked up on adrenaline and ready to use force than they kicked in the wrong door and shot 23-year-old Black U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Roger Fortson to death with six rounds.\n\nThe report states that Fortson was alone in his home talking to a woman on FaceTime when he heard the disturbance that deputies were responding to. The woman says Fortson heard a knock at his door but got no response when he asked who it was. Upon hearing a second, much louder knock, Fortson checked the peephole but saw no one outside. The woman says he grew concerned and went to retrieve his legally owned firearm.

He asked who was there but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn't see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman's account.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn't causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump's statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office didn't immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump's claims. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(WEAR/TND) -- Last Friday's shooting in the Florida panhandle that killed a senior airman with the U.S. Air Force reportedly happened after deputies responding to a disturbance call at the apartment complex burst into the wrong unit.\n\nDispatch calls released to WEAR revealed Okaloosa County deputies reported shooting Fortson within six minutes of dispatch getting the disturbance call.\n\nThe sheriff's office said a deputy acted in self-defense after hearing sounds of a disturbance inside Fortson's off-base apartment, and that Fortson was believed to be armed with a gun after the deputy identified himself as law enforcement.\n\nDispatch calls revealed deputies thought Fortson was shot six times:\n\nGunshot wounds to the chest. One exit wound, counted six gunshot wounds.\n\nAccording to Crump, witnesses said Fortson was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock on the door and asked, \"Who is it?\" but didn't get a response. A few minutes later, there was an aggressive knock on the door, but Fortson didn't see anyone on the other side.\n\nCrump wrote that Fortson grabbed his \"legally-owned\" gun and was shot as he was walking back to the living room, as deputies burst through the door.\n\nAccording to Crump, witnesses said deputies were in the wrong apartment.

He asked who was there but didn\u00b4t get a response. A few minutes later, Fortson heard a louder knock but didn\u00b4t see anyone when he looked through the peephole, Crump said, citing the woman\u00b4s account.\n\nThe woman said Fortson was concerned and went to retrieve his gun, which Crump said was legally owned.\n\nAs Fortson walked back through his living room, deputies burst through the door, saw that Fortson was armed and shot him six times, according to Crump\u00b4s statement. The woman said Fortson was on the ground, saying, \"I can\u00b4t breathe,\" after he was shot, Crump said.\n\nFILE - Civil rights attorney Ben Crump speaks in the Audubon Ballroom, now part of The Malcolm X & Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, in New York, on Wednesday, Feb. 21, 2024. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)\n\nFortson died at a hospital, officials said. The deputy involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nThe woman said Fortson wasn\u00b4t causing a disturbance during their Facetime call and believes that the deputies must have had the wrong apartment, Crump\u00b4s statement said.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger\u00b4s death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger\u00b4s death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy.\"\n\nCrump is a nationally known attorney based in Tallahassee, Florida. He has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Tyre Nichols and George Floyd.\n\nCrump and Fortson's family plan to speak at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach on Thursday morning.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff\u00b4s Office didn\u00b4t immediately respond to an email or voicemail from The Associated Press seeking comment about Crump\u00b4s claims. But Sheriff Eric Aden posted a statement on Facebook Wednesday afternoon expressing sadness about the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community\u00b4s patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" Aden said.\n\nThe sheriff\u00b4s office said in a statement last week that a deputy responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex reacted in self-defense after encountering an armed man. The office did not offer details on what kind of disturbance deputies were responding to or who called them.\n\nThe sheriff's office also declined to immediately identify the responding deputies or their races. Officials said earlier this week that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the local State Attorney\u00b4s Office will investigate the shooting.\n\nFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is highly unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles as a member of the squadron's AC-130J Ghostrider aircrew was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons during missions.\n\nFortson\u00b4s death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police offer fatally shot Botham Jean, an unarmed Black man, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was found guilty of murder the following year and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson\u00b4s front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump has represented families in both cases as part of his ongoing effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\n\"What I\u00b4m trying to do, as much as I can, even sometimes singlehandedly, is increase the value of Black life,\" Crump told The Associated Press in 2021 following the conviction a former Minneapolis officer in the murder of George Floyd.\n\nFort Walton Beach is between Panama City Beach and Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press reporters Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

He asked, 'Who is it?' but didn't get a response,\" a press release said of the witness's account. \"A few minutes later, there was a very aggressive knock on the door, but Roger didn't see anyone when he looked out the peephole.\"\n\n\"Concerned, he did what any other law-abiding citizen would do and retrieved his legally-owned gun, but as he was walking back to the living room, police burst through the door. When they saw the gun, they shot roger six times.\"\n\nThe witness, Crump's firm said, recalled hearing a dying Fortson say \"I can't breathe.\"\n\n\"She has also said the police were in the wrong apartment as there was no disturbance in the apartment and he was alone,\" the firm said.\n\nNow, Ben Crump is demanding the release of body cam video to shed light on the lead-up to Fortson's death, as authorities have resisted releasing recordings as a larger investigation ramps up.\n\n\"The narrative released by law enforcement, which falsely suggests that Roger posed a threat, is deeply troubling and inconsistent with the details provided by that witness: Roger was home alone, causing no disturbance, when his life was tragically cut short by law enforcement,\" Crump said.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden, in a statement on the shooting, described Fortson as \"an armed man.\" The deputy that opened fire, who has not been identified, is on leave, and the shooting is under investigation, Aden added.\n\n\"I immediately placed the deputy on administrative leave and have asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to conduct the investigation that is required in such incidents,\" the sheriff said. \"The State Attorney's Office will also conduct an independent review. At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event.\"\n\nThough the circumstances appear to be different, based on how Crump described the Fortson shooting, it was nonetheless reminiscent of another case, in which Crump represented the family of a Black man who was shot and killed by a police officer who entered the wrong apartment.\n\nAmber Guyger, then a Dallas police officer, was off-duty and returning home from work in September 2018, but Guyger walked up to an apartment door that was not hers. It was 26-year-old Botham Jean's.\n\nThe case established that Guyger, still wearing her uniform, parked her car on the wrong floor of her apartment complex, walked up to Jean's door, ignored telltale signs that the apartment was not hers (such as the floor mat in front of the door that her apartment did not have), pulled her gun, and opened fire wrongly believing Jean, an accountant unwinding at home and eating ice cream, was an intruder.\n\nAfter the shooting, Guyger was heard on 911 audio saying \"I'm f -- ed\" as Jean lay dying.\n\n\"I'm going to lose my job. I thought it was my apartment/ Hey bud. Hey bud. Hey bud. Come on. Oh f -- . I thought it was my apartment,\" she said.\n\nGuyger repeated that last line over and over again.\n\n\"I thought it was my apartment. I thought it was my apartment. I thought it was my apartment. I thought it was my apartment,\" she said. \"Oh my god. I, I, How the f -- did I put the, how did, how did I ... I'm so tired.\"\n\nAt trial, the defense attempted to explain that Guyger was running on \"auto-pilot\" and exhausted from working overtime, but a jury of her peers found her guilty of murder in 2019. That conviction was upheld on appeal.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Florida investigators will find whether the deputy who shot Fortson can credibly raise a self-defense argument, considering that Crump has said Fortson \"legally-owned\" the firearm he \"retrieved\" before his death.\n\nHurlburt Field, the U.S. Air Force base where Fortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron, said in a statement that it would not be releasing additional information \"at this time.\"\n\n\"The 1st Special Operations Wing's priorities are providing casualty affairs service to the family, supporting the squadron during this tragic time, and ensuring resources are available for all who are impacted,\" the statement said.\n\nThe apartment where Fortson was fatally shot was not located on the base but was miles away.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type":

The narrative released by law enforcement, which falsely suggests that Roger posed a threat, is deeply troubling and inconsistent with the details provided by that witness: Roger was home alone, causing no disturbance, when his life was tragically cut short by law enforcement.\"\n\nCrump called for an immediate investigation into the shooting and demanded any bodycam footage recorded during the incident be made available to Fortson's family.\n\n\"We urge authorities to immediately stop demonizing Roger in their statements to the media,\" Crump added. \"It's imperative to correct the record and acknowledge the wrongful entry into Roger's home. What we know for sure is that Roger was a dedicated U.S. Airman serving the country and a cherished member of his community. Any attempts to tarnish his character only compound the pain felt by his loved ones.\"\n\nThe deputy who shot and killed Fortson was not identified and placed on administrative leave, according to reports.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office doesn't have a great track record\n\nLast week was far from the first time that the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office has been involved in a questionable shooting in recent months.\n\nThere could also be additional scrutiny of this shooting because the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office is the same police department that employed a cop who in November infamously shot at an unarmed and handcuffed Black man after mistaking the sound of a falling acorn for a gunshot.\n\nIn that instance, now-former deputy Jesse Hernandez is shown on video shooting at unarmed suspect Marquis Jackson - who was not injured - after an acorn fell onto the roof of the patrol car.\n\nThat prompted Hernandez to yell \"shots fired!\" before he let off some rounds from his own service weapon.\n\nHernandez was allowed to resign gracefully in December while he was under investigation.\n\nIn what could be a sign of things to come from the police shooting and killing Fortson, the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office ultimately described Hernandez's actions on that fateful day as \"reasonable\"and cleared him of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe police murder of Botham Jean\n\nFortson's shooting was reminiscent of the 2018 police murder of Botham Jean when off-duty Dallas police officer Amber Guyger mistook his apartment for her own, profiled the Black man in his own home for a burglar of hers and shiot him to death within seconds. Jean, 27, had been eating Ice cream on his sofa when Guyger broke into his apartment and shot him to death.\n\nIn that instance, the Dallas Police Department was accused of trying to criminalize Jean in death by irrelevantly claiming \"a small amount of marijuana\" wa found in the apartment.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nRIP Johnny Hollman Sr.: Family Of Church Deacon Tased To Death By Atlanta Cop Welcomes $3.8M Settlement\n\nLight Sentence?

Once a deputy arrived on the scene, the OCSO said, Fortson allegedly had a gun in his possession and the deputy acted in self-defense.\n\nAccording to a news release from Crump's law office, the encounter played out differently than what the OCSO has been reporting.\n\nAccording to Crump, a witness who was on a Facetime call with Fortson at the time of the shooting said that Fortson was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock at his door.\n\nFortson asked, \"Who is it?\" and failed to get a response, the release says. A few minutes later, Fortson heard an \"aggressive\" knock, but failed to see anyone once he looked out his peephole.\n\nFortson, concerned for his safety, retrieved his legally owned gun, the release says. As Fortson returned to the living room, the witness said, deputies \"burst through his door.\" When deputies saw the gun, they fired at Fortson six times.\n\nThe witness said he saw Fortson on the ground, stating, \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot. The witness also said police were at the wrong apartment, and there was no disturbance, according to the release.\n\nFortson was taken to a local hospital, where he later died.\n\n\"Roger enlisted in the military after graduating from high school with honors and had no criminal record,\" Crump said in the release. \"By all accounts, he was a stellar member of the Air Force and loved by his community.\"\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, the deputy in question was placed on paid administrative leave, as is standard in such cases, pending the results of an investigation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sheriff Eric Aden released a statement about the shooting. He said all members of his agency \"are saddened about the fatal officer-involved shooting over the weekend.\"\n\nAden then reiterated points made in the previous release from his agency, noting that the deputy in question was placed on administrative leave and that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the shooting.\n\nAden also noted that the State Attorney's Office also will conduct an independent investigation into the shooting.\n\n\"At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,\" said Aden.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said in the release. \"The narrative released by law enforcement, which falsely suggests that Roger posed a threat, is deeply troubling and inconsistent with the details provided by that witness: Roger was home alone, causing no disturbance, when his life was tragically cut short by law enforcement.\n\nEarlier coverage: A Hurlburt Field airman died following a deputy-involved shooting at an FWB apartment\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" the statement continues. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy. We urge authorities to immediately stop demonizing Roger in their statements to the media. It's imperative to correct the record and acknowledge the wrongful entry into Roger's home.

The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office released the bodycam footage from the incident Thursday afternoon, soon after allowing Fortson's family to view the footage.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff's Office Sheriff Eric Aden said he met with Fortson's family for the viewing and offered his condolences to them. He also disputed reports the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment or had entered Fortson's apartment without warning.\n\n\"We are aware of a press release and other comments that falsely state our deputy entered the wrong apartment and implied that they burst through the door into Mr. Fortson's residence,\" Aden told reporters during a Thursday news conference. \"Those statements are inaccurate.\"\n\nFrom the video, one key fact previously claimed by the Sheriff's office is clear: Fortson was holding a handgun when he answered the door.\n\nHowever, in the brief moment in which the gun is visible before he falls, Fortson is holding the gun at his side.\n\nThe video also confirms several other claims that had surfaced around the shooting and dispels others.\n\nThe entire violent encounter lasted five seconds, according to the timestamp on the video: Fortson begins to open the door at 4:32:00. The deputy tells him to \"step back\" two seconds later as the door swings open, then immediately draws and fires at least five shots (a lawyer for Fortson's family claimed earlier Thursday that he had been shot six times).\n\nAfter the shots, with Fortson on the ground, the deputy yells for Fortson to \"drop the gun\" and Fortson responds \"it's over there\" and \"I don't have it.\"\n\nThe video ends with the deputy reporting that shots have been fired and requesting emergency medical services come to the scene.\n\nFortson was a Special Missions Aviator assigned to AC-130J gunships under the 4th Special Operations Squadron, 1st Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field, Florida. He entered active duty on Nov. 19, 2019.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin is following the case \"closely,\" Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters on Thursday.

We obviously need the investigation to run its course, don't want to get ahead of that. But we certainly never want to see our airmen or any military member or part of our DoD family be put into a situation like this.

The sheriff's office recently came under scrutiny after one of its deputies resigned following an internal investigation last year of an incident in which he fired his weapon multiple times at a detained suspect after mistaking the sound of an acorn hitting the roof of his patrol vehicle as a gunshot, GulfLive.com reported.\n\nFortson lived in an off-base residence, and his special operations squadron at Hurlburt Field in the Florida panhandle flies AC-130J Ghostrider gunships.\n\nCrump said there was no disturbance and that Fortson was home alone on a video call with another person, who reported the airman heard a knock on the door.\n\nFortson, according to the witness, asked, \"Who is it?\" But he didn't receive an answer. After a subsequent \"aggressive\" second knock and seeing no one through the peephole, Fortson grabbed his legally owned gun, Crump detailed.\n\nAs Fortson was walking back to his living room, police entered the apartment and shot him. He reportedly said \"I can't breathe\" while on the ground after being shot, Crump said, repeating a witness account of the event.\n\nPublicly available police radio audio reviewed by Military.com reported a call for a disturbance at an apartment complex at 319 Racetrack Road around 4:30 p.m. local time.\n\n\"Don't have anything further than a male and female; it's all fourth party information from the front desk at the leasing office,\" a deputy said on the radio.\n\nA few minutes later, another deputy called in to report \"shots fired, suspect down,\" and called for emergency medical services.\n\n\"Multiple gunshot wounds to the chest, Black male,\" another deputy chimes in shortly after. Fortson was shot six times, Crump said in his statement.\n\nNo other details, including the circumstances of the disturbance that prompted the local deputies to visit the apartment building, were released. Fortson was taken to an area hospital, where he later died. No officers were harmed in the incident.\n\nFortson joined the Air Force on Nov. 19, 2019, according to a copy of his service record provided to Military.com. He joined as an AC-130J gunner. Crump added that Roger graduated from high school with honors and had no criminal record.\n\nThe deputy involved was not identified in the news release and was \"placed on paid administrative leave\" pending the outcome of an investigation and administrative review, the sheriff's office said.\n\nOn Monday evening, Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden released a statement saying the department was \"saddened\" by the incident and calling for further investigation into the shooting.\n\n\"I immediately placed the deputy on administrative leave and have asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to conduct the investigation that is required in such incidents,\" Aden said. \"The State Attorney's Office will also conduct an independent review. At this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office declined to provide Military.com the original 911 call and the police report into the incident, citing \"the ongoing active investigation\" in an emailed response.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of bodycam video to the family,\" Crump said. \"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy. We urge authorities to immediately stop demonizing Roger in their statements to the media. It's imperative to correct the record and acknowledge the wrongful entry into Roger's home.\"", "source": {"uri": "military.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Military"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The narrative released by law enforcement, which falsely suggests that Roger posed a threat, is deeply troubling and inconsistent with the details provided by that witness: Roger was home alone, causing no disturbance, when his life was tragically cut short by law enforcement.\"\n\nCrump called for an immediate investigation into the shooting and demanded any bodycam footage recorded during the incident be made available to Fortson's family.\n\n\"We urge authorities to immediately stop demonizing Roger in their statements to the media,\" Crump added. \"It's imperative to correct the record and acknowledge the wrongful entry into Roger's home. What we know for sure is that Roger was a dedicated U.S. Airman serving the country and a cherished member of his community. Any attempts to tarnish his character only compound the pain felt by his loved ones.\"\n\nThe deputy who shot and killed Fortson was not identified and placed on administrative leave, according to reports.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office doesn't have a great track record\n\nLast week was far from the first time that the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office has been involved in a questionable shooting in recent months.\n\nThere could also be additional scrutiny of this shooting because the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office is the same police department that employed a cop who in November infamously shot at an unarmed and handcuffed Black man after mistaking the sound of a falling acorn for a gunshot.\n\nIn that instance, now-former deputy Jesse Hernandez is shown on video shooting at unarmed suspect Marquis Jackson - who was not injured - after an acorn fell onto the roof of the patrol car.\n\nThat prompted Hernandez to yell \"shots fired!\" before he let off some rounds from his own service weapon.\n\nHernandez was allowed to resign gracefully in December while he was under investigation.\n\nIn what could be a sign of things to come from the police shooting and killing Fortson, the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office ultimately described Hernandez's actions on that fateful day as \"reasonable\"and cleared him of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe police murder of Botham Jean\n\nFortson's shooting was reminiscent of the 2018 police murder of Botham Jean when off-duty Dallas police officer Amber Guyger mistook his apartment for her own, profiled the Black man in his own home for a burglar of hers and shiot him to death within seconds. Jean, 27, had been eating Ice cream on his sofa when Guyger broke into his apartment and shot him to death.\n\nIn that instance, the Dallas Police Department was accused of trying to criminalize Jean in death by irrelevantly claiming \"a small amount of marijuana\" wa found in the apartment.\n\nRIP Johnny Hollman Sr.: Family Of Church Deacon Tased To Death By Atlanta Cop Welcomes $3.8M Settlement\n\nLight Sentence?

He also has been involved in environmental justice cases, such as representing the residents of Flint, Mich.\n\nHow the deadly police-involved shooting unfolded\n\nFortson, who was from Atlanta, was at his off-base apartment on Racetrack Road when the shooting happened around 4:30 p.m., according to the Air Force.\n\nA witness who was on Facetime with Fortson during the entire encounter said Fortson was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock at the door, according to Crump.\n\nThe witness suggested the police were at the wrong apartment since Fortson was alone and there was no disturbance, Crump said.\n\nFortson allegedly asked, \"Who is it?\" but did not receive a response.\n\n\"A few minutes later, there was a very aggressive knock on the door, but Roger didn't see anyone when he looked out the peephole,\" Crump said. \"Concerned, he did what any other law-abiding citizen would do and retrieved his legally owned gun, but as he was walking back to the living room, police burst through the door.\"\n\nFortson was shot six times, according to Crump. The witness said she saw him on the ground saying, \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nFortson was taken to the hospital, where he died.\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment,\" Crump said. \"The narrative released by law enforcement, which falsely suggests that Roger posed a threat, is deeply troubling and inconsistent with the details provided by that witness: Roger was home alone, causing no disturbance, when his life was tragically cut short by law enforcement.\"\n\n'Calling for transparency'\n\nThe deputy was placed on administrative leave, \"pending the outcome of a formal investigation and administrative review,\" according to the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"We are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family,\" Crump said.\n\nNewsweek requested body camera footage from the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Department but was told \"due to this being an open/active investigation currently, BWC videos are unavailable for release.\" The department also denied a request to release the affidavit.\n\n\"His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy,\" Crump said. \"We urge authorities to immediately stop demonizing Roger in their statements to the media. It's imperative to correct the record and acknowledge the wrongful entry into Roger's home.\"\n\nWho was Roger Fortson?\n\nFortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron at Hurlburt Field, Fla., according to the Air Force. He entered active duty on Nov. 19, 2019. He enrolled after graduating from high school in Atlanta with honors.\n\nHe had no criminal record, according to Crump.\n\nDozens of heartfelt messages on Facebook have called him a \"phenomenal human\" who \"always had a smile on his face.\"\n\n\"What we know for sure is that Roger was a dedicated U.S. Airman serving the country and a cherished member of his community,\" Crump said. \"Any attempts to tarnish his character only compound the pain felt by his loved ones.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(WJHG/WECP) - Civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump has been retained by the family of Roger Fortson, a 23-year-old active-duty Senior Airman who was fatally shot by an Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office Deputy on Friday, May 4.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press Fortson was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. In a statement released by the U.S. Air Force, they say he died at his off-base residence.\n\nOn Friday, the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office reported a deputy responded to a disturbance call in which they said the deputy encountered an armed man.\n\nTheir full statement regarding the incident is below:\n\n\"All of us at the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office are saddened about the fatal officer-involved shooting over the weekend.\n\nLate Friday afternoon, our deputy responded to a call of a disturbance in progress where he encountered an armed man. The deputy shot the man, who later succumbed to his injuries.\n\nI immediately placed the deputy on administrative leave and have asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to conduct the investigation that is required in such incidents.\n\nThe State Attorney's Office will also conduct an independent review.\n\nAt this time, we humbly ask for our community's patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event.\"\n\nAccording to a witness who was on Facetime with Roger during the encounter, he was alone in his apartment when he heard a knock at the door.\n\nHe reportedly asked, 'Who is it?' but did not get a response. According to Attorney Crump's office, Roger heard another aggressive knock but did not see anyone when he looked inside the peephole.\n\nThose representing the family said that Roger was concerned and had grabbed his legally owned gun but as he was walking back to the living room law enforcement busted through the door.\n\nWhen they saw the gun they reportedly shot Roger six times. The witness stated she saw Roger on the ground stating \"I can't breathe,\" after he was shot.\n\nThe witness also said the police were in the wrong apartment and there was no disturbance in the apartment Roger was in.\n\nAccording to Crump's office, Roger enlisted in the military after graduating from high school with honors and had no criminal record.\n\nThe following is a statement from Attorney Ben Crump:\n\n\"The circumstances surrounding Roger's death raise serious questions that demand immediate answers from authorities, especially considering the alarming witness statement that the police entered the wrong apartment. The narrative released by law enforcement, which falsely suggests that Roger posed a threat, is deeply troubling and inconsistent with the details provided by that witness: Roger was home alone, causing no disturbance, when his life was tragically cut short by law enforcement.\n\nWe are calling for transparency in the investigation into Roger's death and the immediate release of body cam video to the family. His family and the public deserve to know what occurred in the moments leading up to this tragedy. We urge authorities to immediately stop demonizing Roger in their statements to the media. It's imperative to correct the record and acknowledge the wrongful entry into Roger's home. What we know for sure is that Roger was a dedicated U.S. Airman serving the country and a cherished member of his community. Any attempts to tarnish his character only compound the pain felt by his loved ones.", "source": {"uri": "fox10tv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX10 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okaloosa_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurlburt_Field", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurlburt Field"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WJHG-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WJHG-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Crump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Crump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Department_of_Law_Enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Department of Law Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administrative leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_can't_breathe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "I can't breathe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witness statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://gray-wala-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/NHJNNAUC4RH33G6FOCIM6L3GCM.jpg?auth=b0fb79abc9758522c6998ace460efdac65a84c80c85bea242cdc7addfe4ae554&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546267", "eventUri": "eng-9546267", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Okaloosa County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 256, "textEnd": 261}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- A Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman inside his apartment in the state's Panhandle, according to body camera video shown to reporters Thursday.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys held a news conference in which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense. Aden rejected assertions made by civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, that the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment, covered the door's peephole and did not announce himself.\n\nThe video shows the deputy arriving at a Fort Walton Beach apartment building on May 3 and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nThe video shows the deputy banging on the door and stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. Twice he shouted: \"Sheriff's office! Open the door!\"\n\nFortson opened the door and could be seen holding what appeared to be handgun pointed down toward the floor. The deputy shouted, \"Step back!\" and fired off shots. He then shouted, \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun!\"\n\n\"It's over there,\" Fortson said.\n\n\"Drop the gun!\" the deputy yelled back.\n\n\"I don't have it,\" Fortson said, lying on the ground.\n\nThe deputy then called paramedics on his radio.\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputy or his race. The deputy was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump released a statement later noting that the officer did not tell Roger to drop his gun before shooting \"multiple times within a split second of the door being opened.\"\n\n\"We remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment,\" the statement said.\n\nCrump also told reporters earlier that Fortson was talking to his girlfriend on FaceTime and that he grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment. He said that the deputy burst into the apartment, citing the account of the girlfriend, who has not yet been identified.\n\n\"The girlfriend acknowledges that even though she initially thought the door was forced open by the police that she stands by her emotional recollection of what happened,\" Crump's later statement said.\n\nAden said he had met with the family before showing the video to reporters and extended his deepest condolences.\n\n\"This result is one we never hope to encounter,\" Aden said. \"These investigations take time, but I want to assure you that we are not hiding or attempting to cover anything up.\"\n\nOfficials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating. FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nThe sheriff said the probe was being handled as a criminal investigation and that no determination had yet been made on whether the deputy's actions were justified or not. However, the initial news release from the sheriff's office that described the shooting said that the deputy \"reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun.\"\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times.\n\nHe said Fortson had always wanted to join the U.S. Air Force and enlisted after graduating high school. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile law enforcement shooting cases involving Black people, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes, in circumstances that involved officers responding to the wrong address or responding to service calls with wanton uses of deadly force.\n\nIn 2018, a white former Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white former Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nSchneider reported from Orlando, Fla.\n\nThe spelling of the name of Fortson's mother has been corrected to Chantemekki instead of Chantimekki.", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@theadvocate.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

Both testified at Dean's trial that they thought the house might have been burglarized and quietly moved into the fenced-off backyard looking for signs of forced entry.\n\nJefferson and her then-8-year-old nephew, Zion Carr, were up late playing video games. They'd left doors open to vent smoke after earlier burning hamburgers.\n\nZion testified that Jefferson took out her gun because she believed there was an intruder in the backyard. Dean fired a single shot through the window a split-second after shouting at Jefferson, who was inside, to show her hands.\n\nDean was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and the former officer was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nAiyana Stanley-Jones, 7, was fatally shot inside her family's Detroit home in 2010 by police who burst into the wrong unit of a duplex while looking for a man suspected in a killing that had been committed days earlier. The suspect was eventually arrested in the second-floor unit of the duplex.\n\nAiyana, who was Black, was shot in the head while sleeping on a couch.\n\nJoseph Weekley, a member of an elite police unit, was the first officer through the door of her home. Weekley, who is white, said he accidentally fired his gun during a struggle with Aiyana's grandmother.\n\nWeekley was charged with involuntary manslaughter but his first trial ended without a verdict in 2013 and his second ended in 2015 with a hung jury. During the second trial, a judge dismissed that charge.\n\nBreonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman, was killed by police officers who knocked down the door to her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2020 while executing a drug search warrant that was later found to be flawed.\n\nTaylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a single shot that hit one of the officers as they came through the door of the apartment, and officers returned fire, striking Taylor in the apartment hallway multiple times.\n\nWalker told police investigators that he heard knocking but did not hear police announce themselves. He said he was \"scared to death,\" so he grabbed his gun and when the door was knocked down, he fired a shot.\n\nOfficers found no drugs in Taylor's apartment.\n\nFormer Louisville officer Brett Hankison, who fired 10 shots into Taylor's window and glass door, was found not guilty in 2022 on state charges that he endangered her neighbors when he opened fire. Some of his shots flew into a neighboring apartment, but none of them struck anyone.\n\nLast year a jury deadlocked over federal civil rights charges that Hankison used excessive force that night. Federal prosecutors have said they intend to retry him.\n\nThree other former officers involved in drawing up the warrant were charged in a separate federal case. One of them, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty to helping falsify the warrant.

Body camera video shown to reporters Thursday shows the deputy going to Fortson's door after speaking to a woman who described hearing an argument.\n\nAttorney Ben Crump, who has been hired by Fortson's family, has said Fortson was talking to his girlfriend on FaceTime when the deputy arrived. Crump said Fortson grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment, got no response when he asked who was there and discovered the peephole on his door was blocked.\n\nOn the body camera video, the deputy can be heard yelling that he was from the sheriff's department and knocking, while also stepping seemingly out of view of the door. The video then shows Fortson opening the door with what appears to be a gun in his hand pointed toward the ground.\n\nThe deputy quickly fires several shots, yelling for Fortson to drop the gun after he is already on the ground wounded.\n\nAmber Guyger was still in uniform after a long shift when she walked up to Jean's apartment -- which was on the fourth floor, directly above hers on the third -- and found the door unlocked.\n\nJean, an accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, had been eating a bowl of ice cream when Guyger entered his home and shot him. He was unarmed.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old Black woman, was fatally shot through a window in her home in 2019 by Aaron Dean, a white officer, as he responded to a nonemergency call about the door to her Fort Worth, Texas, home being open.\n\nBody camera footage showed that Dean and a second officer didn't identify themselves as police at the house. Both testified at Dean's trial that they thought the house might have been burglarized and quietly moved into the fenced-off backyard looking for signs of forced entry.\n\nJefferson and her then-8-year-old nephew, Zion Carr, were up late playing video games. They'd left doors open to vent smoke after earlier burning hamburgers.\n\nZion testified that Jefferson took out her gun because she believed there was an intruder in the backyard. Dean fired a single shot through the window a split-second after shouting at Jefferson, who was inside, to show her hands.\n\nAiyana Stanley-Jones, 7, was fatally shot inside her family's Detroit home in 2010 by police who burst into the wrong unit of a duplex while looking for a man suspected in a killing that had been committed days earlier. The suspect was eventually arrested in the second-floor unit of the duplex.\n\nAiyana, who was Black, was shot in the head while sleeping on a couch.\n\nJoseph Weekley, a member of an elite police unit, was the first officer through the door of her home. Weekley, who is white, said he accidentally fired his gun during a struggle with Aiyana's grandmother.\n\nWeekley was charged with involuntary manslaughter but his first trial ended without a verdict in 2013 and his second ended in 2015 with a hung jury. During the second trial, a judge dismissed that charge.\n\nBREONNA TAYLOR\n\nBreonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman, was killed by police officers who knocked down the door to her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2020 while executing a drug search warrant that was later found to be flawed.\n\nTaylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a single shot that hit one of the officers as they came through the door of the apartment, and officers returned fire, striking Taylor in the apartment hallway multiple times.\n\nWalker told police investigators that he heard knocking but did not hear police announce themselves. He said he was \"scared to death,\" so he grabbed his gun and when the door was knocked down, he fired a shot.\n\nOfficers found no drugs in Taylor's apartment.\n\nFormer Louisville officer Brett Hankison, who fired 10 shots into Taylor's window and glass door, was found not guilty in 2022 on state charges that he endangered her neighbors when he opened fire. Some of his shots flew into a neighboring apartment, but none of them struck anyone.\n\nLast year a jury deadlocked over federal civil rights charges that Hankison used excessive force that night. Federal prosecutors have said they intend to retry him.\n\nThree other former officers involved in drawing up the warrant were charged in a separate federal case. One of them, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty to helping falsify the warrant. She's expected to testify against the other two in the upcoming trial.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The police claim the deputy responded to a reported \"disturbance,\" but a witness claims the police showed up at the wrong address before shooting Fortson six times.\n\nWhat happened to Roger Fortson?\n\nInitial reports provided by the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office claimed the deputy acted out of \"self defense\" because Fortson was armed with a gun. The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office also said the deputy opened fire only after he \"identified himself as law enforcement.\"\n\nBut Fortson's family suggested in a statement after watching the bodycam video of the shooting that those claims were not entirely true.\n\n\"In the four-and-a-half minute, heavily redacted video, it is very troubling that the deputy gave no verbal commands and shot multiple times within a split second of the door being opened, killing Roger,\" the family said in a statement shared with NewsOne. \"Despite the redactions, the video has provided some answers, but it's also raised even more troubling questions: As the officer didn't tell Roger to drop the weapon before shooting, was the officer trained to give verbal warnings? Did the officer try to initiate life-saving measures? Was the officer trained to deal with law-abiding citizens who are registered gun owners?\"\n\nThe fateful Facetime call\n\nFortson was on a Facetime call with his girlfriend at the time of the shooting, according to civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the Airman's family. The unidentified deputy knocked on Fortson's apartment door, but didn't answer when asked who was knocking, Crump said. Fortson's girlfriend said a few minutes later the knocking got \"very aggressive,\" according to Crump. Again, no one answered when asked \"who is it?\" and Fortson, an active member of the U.S. military and possibly suspecting a burglar, armed himself with his legally owned gun.\n\nThat's when the police kicked in Fortson's door, saw he had a gun and shot him six times, Crump said.\n\nFortson's girlfriend said she saw and heard Fortson on the ground claiming, \"I can't breathe,\" according to Crump.\n\nCrump said Fortson's girlfriend claimed that the officers went to the wrong apartment because there was no disturbance happening while she and Fortson were on the Facetime call.\n\nFortson was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.\n\n\"The girlfriend acknowledges that even though she initially thought the door was forced open by the police that she stands by her emotional recollection of what happened,\" Fortson's family continued while sharing nearly four-minute long video footage from the Facetime call. The video, which is graphic and should be viewed with discretion, can be watched by clicking here.\n\nFortson's family added that they \"remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment.\"\n\nCrump has called for an immediate investigation into the shooting and suggested the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office was trying to assassinate Fortson's character in death.\n\n\"We urge authorities to immediately stop demonizing Roger in their statements to the media,\" Crump previously said. \"It's imperative to correct the record and acknowledge the wrongful entry into Roger's home. What we know for sure is that Roger was a dedicated U.S. Airman serving the country and a cherished member of his community. Any attempts to tarnish his character only compound the pain felt by his loved ones.\"\n\nThe deputy who shot and killed Fortson was not identified and placed on administrative leave, according to reports.\n\nRoger Fortson bodycam video\n\nNBC News has obtained the bodycam video:\n\nThe video shows the deputy arriving on scene and being directed to apartment 1401 by a woman whose face is blurred. The woman tells him that someone had overheard arguing there.\n\nThe video shows the deputy knocking and twice saying, \"Sheriff's office. Open the door.\"\n\nWhen Fortson opens the door, he appears to be holding a gun that is facing downward. The deputy says, \"Step back\" and fires his weapon multiple times. Fortson falls to the floor. The deputy twice yells, \"Drop the gun,\" to which Fortson replies, \"It's over there.\"\n\nThe deputy then calls for medical assistance.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office doesn't have a great track record\n\nLast week was far from the first time that the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office has been involved in a questionable shooting in recent months.\n\nThere could also be additional scrutiny of this shooting because the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office is the same police department that employed a cop who in November infamously shot at an unarmed and handcuffed Black man after mistaking the sound of a falling acorn for a gunshot.\n\nIn that instance, now-former deputy Jesse Hernandez is shown on video shooting at unarmed suspect Marquis Jackson - who was not injured - after an acorn fell onto the roof of the patrol car.\n\nThat prompted Hernandez to yell \"shots fired!\" before he let off some rounds from his own service weapon.\n\nHernandez was allowed to resign gracefully in December while he was under investigation.\n\nIn what could be a sign of things to come from the police shooting and killing Fortson, the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office ultimately described Hernandez's actions on that fateful day as \"reasonable\"and cleared him of any wrongdoing.\n\nSimilarities to the police murder of Botham Jean\n\nFortson's shooting was reminiscent of the 2018 police murder of Botham Jean when off-duty Dallas police officer Amber Guyger mistook his apartment for her own, profiled the Black man in his own home for a burglar of hers and shot him to death within seconds. Jean, 27, had been eating Ice cream on his sofa when Guyger broke into his apartment and shot him to death.\n\nIn that instance, the Dallas Police Department was accused of trying to criminalize Jean in death by irrelevantly claiming \"a small amount of marijuana\" was found in the apartment.\n\nRIP Johnny Hollman Sr.: Family Of Church Deacon Tased To Death By Atlanta Cop Welcomes $3.8M Settlement\n\nLight Sentence?

The police claim the deputy responded to a reported \"disturbance,\" but a witness claims the police showed up at the wrong address before shooting Fortson six times.\n\nWhat happened to Roger Fortson?\n\nInitial reports provided by the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office claimed the deputy acted out of \"self defense\" because Fortson was armed with a gun. The Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office also said the deputy opened fire only after he \"identified himself as law enforcement.\"\n\nBut Fortson's family suggested in a statement after watching the bodycam video of the shooting that those claims were not entirely true.\n\n\"In the four-and-a-half minute, heavily redacted video, it is very troubling that the deputy gave no verbal commands and shot multiple times within a split second of the door being opened, killing Roger,\" the family said in a statement shared with NewsOne. \"Despite the redactions, the video has provided some answers, but it's also raised even more troubling questions: As the officer didn't tell Roger to drop the weapon before shooting, was the officer trained to give verbal warnings? Did the officer try to initiate life-saving measures? Was the officer trained to deal with law-abiding citizens who are registered gun owners?\"\n\nThe fateful Facetime call\n\nFortson was on a Facetime call with his girlfriend at the time of the shooting, according to civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the Airman's family. The unidentified deputy knocked on Fortson's apartment door, but didn't answer when asked who was knocking, Crump said. Fortson's girlfriend said a few minutes later the knocking got \"very aggressive,\" according to Crump. Again, no one answered when asked \"who is it?\" and Fortson, an active member of the U.S. military and possibly suspecting a burglar, armed himself with his legally owned gun.\n\nThat's when the police kicked in Fortson's door, saw he had a gun and shot him six times, Crump said.\n\nFortson's girlfriend said she saw and heard Fortson on the ground claiming, \"I can't breathe,\" according to Crump.\n\nCrump said Fortson's girlfriend claimed that the officers went to the wrong apartment because there was no disturbance happening while she and Fortson were on the Facetime call.\n\nFortson was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.\n\n\"The girlfriend acknowledges that even though she initially thought the door was forced open by the police that she stands by her emotional recollection of what happened,\" Fortson's family continued while sharing nearly four-minute long video footage from the Facetime call. The video, which is graphic and should be viewed with discretion, can be watched by clicking here.\n\nFortson's family added that they \"remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment.\"\n\nCrump has called for an immediate investigation into the shooting and suggested the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office was trying to assassinate Fortson's character in death.\n\n\"We urge authorities to immediately stop demonizing Roger in their statements to the media,\" Crump previously said. \"It's imperative to correct the record and acknowledge the wrongful entry into Roger's home. What we know for sure is that Roger was a dedicated U.S. Airman serving the country and a cherished member of his community. Any attempts to tarnish his character only compound the pain felt by his loved ones.\"\n\nThe deputy who shot and killed Fortson was not identified and placed on administrative leave, according to reports.\n\nRoger Fortson bodycam video\n\nNBC News has obtained the bodycam video:\n\nThe video shows the deputy arriving on scene and being directed to apartment 1401 by a woman whose face is blurred. The woman tells him that someone had overheard arguing there.\n\nThe video shows the deputy knocking and twice saying, \"Sheriff's office. Open the door.\"\n\nWhen Fortson opens the door, he appears to be holding a gun that is facing downward. The deputy says, \"Step back\" and fires his weapon multiple times. Fortson falls to the floor. The deputy twice yells, \"Drop the gun,\" to which Fortson replies, \"It's over there.\"\n\nThe deputy then calls for medical assistance.\n\nThe Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office doesn't have a great track record\n\nLast week was far from the first time that the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office has been involved in a questionable shooting in recent months.\n\nThere could also be additional scrutiny of this shooting because the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office is the same police department that employed a cop who in November infamously shot at an unarmed and handcuffed Black man after mistaking the sound of a falling acorn for a gunshot.\n\nIn that instance, now-former deputy Jesse Hernandez is shown on video shooting at unarmed suspect Marquis Jackson - who was not injured - after an acorn fell onto the roof of the patrol car.\n\nThat prompted Hernandez to yell \"shots fired!\" before he let off some rounds from his own service weapon.\n\nHernandez was allowed to resign gracefully in December while he was under investigation.\n\nIn what could be a sign of things to come from the police shooting and killing Fortson, the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office ultimately described Hernandez's actions on that fateful day as \"reasonable\"and cleared him of any wrongdoing.\n\nSimilarities to the police murder of Botham Jean\n\nFortson's shooting was reminiscent of the 2018 police murder of Botham Jean when off-duty Dallas police officer Amber Guyger mistook his apartment for her own, profiled the Black man in his own home for a burglar of hers and shot him to death within seconds. Jean, 27, had been eating Ice cream on his sofa when Guyger broke into his apartment and shot him to death.\n\nIn that instance, the Dallas Police Department was accused of trying to criminalize Jean in death by irrelevantly claiming \"a small amount of marijuana\" was found in the apartment.\n\nRIP Johnny Hollman Sr.: Family Of Church Deacon Tased To Death By Atlanta Cop Welcomes $3.8M Settlement\n\nLight Sentence?

(AP) -- A Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman inside his apartment in the state's Panhandle, according to body camera video shown to reporters Thursday.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys held a news conference in which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense. Aden rejected assertions made by civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, that the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment, covered the door's peephole and did not announce himself.\n\nThe video shows the deputy arriving at a Fort Walton Beach apartment building on May 3 and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nThe video shows the deputy banging on the door and stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. Twice he shouted: \"Sheriff's office! Open the door!\"\n\nFortson opened the door and could be seen holding what appeared to be handgun pointed down toward the floor. The deputy shouted, \"Step back!\" and fired off shots. He then shouted, \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun!\"\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputy or his race. The deputy was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump released a statement later noting that the officer did not tell Fortson to drop his gun before shooting \"multiple times within a split second of the door being opened.\"\n\n\"We remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment,\" the statement said.\n\nCrump also told reporters earlier that Fortson was talking to his girlfriend on FaceTime and that he grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment. He said that the deputy burst into the apartment, citing the account of the girlfriend, who has not yet been identified.\n\n\"The girlfriend acknowledges that even though she initially thought the door was forced open by the police that she stands by her emotional recollection of what happened,\" Crump's later statement said.\n\nIn a clip from the FaceTime video captured by Fortson's cellphone, the airman can be heard groaning and saying, \"I can't breathe.\" A deputy can be heard yelling back at him, \"Stop moving!\" The phone is pointed at the ceiling and does not show what is going on in the apartment.\n\nAden said he had met with the family Thursday and extended his deepest condolences.\n\n\"This result is one we never hope to encounter,\" Aden said. \"These investigations take time, but I want to assure you that we are not hiding or attempting to cover anything up.\"\n\nOfficials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating. FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nThe sheriff said the probe was being handled as a criminal investigation and that no determination had yet been made on whether the deputy's actions were justified or not. However, the initial news release from the sheriff's office that described the shooting said that the deputy \"reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun.\"\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times.\n\nFortson enlisted in the Air Force after graduating high school, Crump said. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile cases of Black people in fatal encounters with law enforcement and vigilantes, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes.\n\nIn 2018, a white Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of the name of Fortson's mother to Chantemekki instead of Chantimekki and to reflect that some of the cases Crump has been involved with were encounters with vigilantes, not just law enforcement.", "source": {"uri": "delcotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Delaware County Daily

(AP) -- A Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman inside his apartment in the state's Panhandle, according to body camera video shown to reporters Thursday.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys held a news conference in which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense. Aden rejected assertions made by civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, that the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment, covered the door's peephole and did not announce himself.\n\nThe video shows the deputy arriving at a Fort Walton Beach apartment building on May 3 and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nThe video shows the deputy banging on the door and stepping aside, seemingly out of view of the door. Twice he shouted: \"Sheriff's office! Open the door!\"\n\nFortson opened the door and could be seen holding what appeared to be handgun pointed down toward the floor. The deputy shouted, \"Step back!\" and fired off shots. He then shouted, \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun!\"\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputy or his race. The deputy was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump released a statement later noting that the officer did not tell Fortson to drop his gun before shooting \"multiple times within a split second of the door being opened.\"\n\n\"We remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment,\" the statement said.\n\nCrump also told reporters earlier that Fortson was talking to his girlfriend on FaceTime and that he grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment. He said that the deputy burst into the apartment, citing the account of the girlfriend, who has not yet been identified.\n\n\"The girlfriend acknowledges that even though she initially thought the door was forced open by the police that she stands by her emotional recollection of what happened,\" Crump's later statement said.\n\nIn a clip from the FaceTime video captured by Fortson's cellphone, the airman can be heard groaning and saying, \"I can't breathe.\" A deputy can be heard yelling back at him, \"Stop moving!\" The phone is pointed at the ceiling and does not show what is going on in the apartment.\n\nAden said he had met with the family Thursday and extended his deepest condolences.\n\n\"This result is one we never hope to encounter,\" Aden said. \"These investigations take time, but I want to assure you that we are not hiding or attempting to cover anything up.\"\n\nOfficials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating. FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nThe sheriff said the probe was being handled as a criminal investigation and that no determination had yet been made on whether the deputy's actions were justified or not. However, the initial news release from the sheriff's office that described the shooting said that the deputy \"reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun.\"\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times.\n\nFortson enlisted in the Air Force after graduating high school, Crump said. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile cases of Black people in fatal encounters with law enforcement and vigilantes, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes.\n\nIn 2018, a white Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of the name of Fortson's mother to Chantemekki instead of Chantimekki and to reflect that some of the cases Crump has been involved with were encounters with vigilantes, not just law enforcement.", "source": {"uri": "delcotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Delaware County Daily

Fortson was shot in his apartment after a response to a complaint.\n\nBy STEPHEN SMITH and MIKE SCHNEIDER - Associated Press\n\nFORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A Florida sheriff's deputy announced himself as law enforcement just before fatally shooting a Black U.S. Air Force airman inside his apartment in the state's Panhandle, according to body camera video shown to reporters Thursday.\n\nOkaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden presented the video hours after the family of Senior Airman Roger Fortson and their attorneys held a news conference in which they disputed that the deputy acted in self-defense. Aden rejected assertions made by civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, that the deputy had gone to the wrong apartment, covered the door's peephole and did not announce himself.\n\nThe video shows the deputy arriving at a Fort Walton Beach apartment building on May 3 and speaking to a woman outside who described hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Twice he shouted: \"Sheriff's office! Open the door!\"\n\nFortson opened the door and could be seen holding what appeared to be handgun pointed down toward the floor. The deputy shouted, \"Step back!\" and fired off shots. He then shouted, \"Drop the gun! Drop the gun!\"\n\n\"It's over there,\" Fortson said.\n\n\"Drop the gun!\" the deputy yelled back.\n\n\"I don't have it,\" Fortson said, lying on the ground.\n\nThe deputy then called paramedics on his radio.\n\nThe sheriff's office has declined to identify the responding deputy or his race. The deputy was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.\n\nCrump released a statement later noting that the officer did not tell Fortson to drop his gun before shooting \"multiple times within a split second of the door being opened.\"\n\n\"We remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment,\" the statement said.\n\nCrump also told reporters earlier that Fortson was talking to his girlfriend on FaceTime and that he grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment. He said that the deputy burst into the apartment, citing the account of the girlfriend, who has not yet been identified.\n\n\"The girlfriend acknowledges that even though she initially thought the door was forced open by the police that she stands by her emotional recollection of what happened,\" Crump's later statement said.\n\nIn a clip from the FaceTime video captured by Fortson's cellphone, the airman can be heard groaning and saying, \"I can't breathe.\" A deputy can be heard yelling back at him, \"Stop moving!\" The phone is pointed at the ceiling and does not show what is going on in the apartment.\n\nAden said he had met with the family Thursday and extended his deepest condolences.\n\n\"This result is one we never hope to encounter,\" Aden said. \"These investigations take time, but I want to assure you that we are not hiding or attempting to cover anything up.\"\n\nOfficials have said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating. FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it is unlikely the agency will have any further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nThe sheriff said the probe was being handled as a criminal investigation and that no determination had yet been made on whether the deputy's actions were justified or not. However, the initial news release from the sheriff's office that described the shooting said that the deputy \"reacted in self-defense after he encountered a 23-year-old man armed with a gun.\"\n\nFortson's mother, Chantemekki Fortson, walked into the morning news conference with Crump holding a framed portrait of her son in his dress uniform. She burst into tears as Crump spoke about her son's death.\n\n\"My baby was shot up,\" she said.\n\nCrump called the shooting \"an unjustifiable killing.\"\n\n\"For whatever reason, they thought he was a bad guy, but he was a good guy. He was a great guy. He was an exceptional guy,\" Crump said. \"They took a patriot from us.\"\n\nCrump said Fortson, originally from Atlanta, was shot six times.\n\nFortson enlisted in the Air Force after graduating high school, Crump said. He was based at the Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field. As a special missions aviator, one of his roles was to load the gunship's cannons during missions.\n\nCrump, based in Tallahassee, Florida, has been involved in multiple high-profile cases of Black people in fatal encounters with law enforcement and vigilantes, including those of Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, Tyre Nichols, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who was also killed in her home during a no-knock police raid that targeted her ex-boyfriend in 2020.\n\nFortson's death draws striking similarities to other Black people killed in recent years by police in their homes.\n\nIn 2018, a white Dallas police officer fatally shot Botham Jean, who was unarmed, after mistaking his apartment for her own. Amber Guyger, the former officer, was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nIn 2019, a white Fort Worth, Texas, officer fatally shot Atatiana Jefferson through a rear window of her home after responding to a nonemergency call reporting that Jefferson's front door was open. Aaron Dean, the former officer, was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nCrump represented families in both cases as part of his effort to force accountability for the killings of Black people at the hands of police.\n\nSchneider reported from Orlando, Fla.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of the name of Fortson's mother to Chantemekki instead of Chantimekki and to reflect that some of the cases Crump has been involved with were encounters with vigilantes, not just law enforcement.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Just two days before a sheriff's deputy in Florida shot him dead, U.S. Air Force airman Roger Fortson called home to find out what his 10-year-old sister wanted for her birthday.\n\nIt was a typical gesture for the 23-year-old from Atlanta, who doted on the girl and was devoted to helping her, a younger brother and his mom prosper, his family says.\n\n\"He was trying to give me everything that I never could get for myself,\" his mother, Chantemekki Fortson, said Thursday at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach, where her son was living when he was killed.\n\nHe was her \"gift,\" she said, the man who taught her to love and forgive and served as her co-worker and counselor.\n\nAn Okaloosa County sheriff's deputy shot Fortson on May 3. Sheriff's officials say he acted in self-defense while responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex. But civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the Fortson family, has accused the deputy of going to the wrong apartment and said the shooting was unjustified.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating.\n\nAt Thursday's news conference, Chantemekki Fortson held a large framed portrait of her son in dress uniform. He joined the Air Force in 2019, the same year he graduated from Ronald McNair -- a majority Black high school in metro Atlanta's DeKalb County where roughly half of students don't graduate in four years.\n\nAir Force service was a lifelong dream, and Fortson rose to the rank of senior airman. He was stationed at Hurlburt Field near Fort Walton Beach.\n\n\"Where we come from, we don't end up where Roger ended up,\" his mother said.\n\nFortson, a gunner aboard the AC-130J, earned an Air Medal with combat device, which is typically awarded after 20 flights in a combat zone or for conspicuous valor or achievement on a single mission. An Air Force official said Fortson's award reflected both -- completing flights in a combat zone and taking specific actions during one of the missions to address an in-flight emergency and allow the mission to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details that had not been made public.\n\nBut his service, like almost everything else he did, had a larger purpose.\n\n\"He was trying to help his family have a better life,\" Crump said Thursday.\n\nThat meant serving as a role model for his 16-year-old brother, his mom said, saving up to try to buy her a house, and getting her a new car. His nickname was \"Mr. Make It Happen.\"\n\nChantemekki Fortson recalled that her son, then in high school, accompanied her in an ambulance to the hospital when she was giving birth to her daughter and tried to tell the doctor how to deliver the baby.\n\nThe girl and his brother were always in his thoughts. Fortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons.\n\nChantemekki Fortson said her son was injured while loading a plane and was in such severe pain he thought he would die. But he told his mom he had to push through for his brother and sister.\n\nHe was also by her side when she got into an accident a short time later and needed to go the emergency room.\n\n\"That's the kind of gift he was,\" she said. \"They took something that can never be replaced.\"\n\n___\n\nThanawala reported from Atlanta.

Body camera video viewed by reporters Thursday shows the Okaloosa County deputy arriving at the apartment building and speaking to a woman who described someone hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nOn the body camera video, the deputy can be heard yelling that he was from the sheriff's department and knocking, while also stepping seemingly out of view of the door. The video then shows Fortson opening the door with what appears to be a gun in his hand pointed toward the ground.\n\nThe deputy quickly fires several shots, yelling for Fortson to drop the gun after he is already on the ground wounded.\n\nAttorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, has said Fortson was talking to his girlfriend on FaceTime and grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment.\n\nCrump said in a Thursday statement that \"we remain adamant\" that law enforcement went to the wrong apartment. The sheriff rejects that assertion.\n\nBotham Jean, an 26-year-old Black man, was fatally shot in 2018 by a white police officer who mistook his Dallas apartment for her own.\n\nAmber Guyger was still in uniform after a long shift when she walked up to Jean's apartment -- which was on the fourth floor, directly above hers on the third -- and found the door unlocked.\n\nJean, an accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, had been eating a bowl of ice cream when Guyger entered his home and shot him. He was unarmed.\n\nGuyger, the former officer, was found guilty in 2019 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old Black woman, was fatally shot through a window at her home in 2019 by Aaron Dean, a white officer, as he responded to a nonemergency call about the door to her Fort Worth, Texas, home being open.\n\nBody camera footage showed that Dean and a second officer didn't identify themselves as police at the house. Both testified at Dean's trial that they thought the house might have been burglarized and quietly moved into the fenced-off backyard looking for signs of forced entry.\n\nJefferson and her then-8-year-old nephew, Zion Carr, were up late playing video games. They'd left doors open to vent smoke after earlier burning hamburgers.\n\nCarr testified that Jefferson took out her gun because she believed there was an intruder in the backyard. Dean fired a single shot through the window a split-second after shouting at Jefferson, who was inside, to show her hands.\n\nDean was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and the former officer was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nAiyana Stanley-Jones, a 7-year-old Black girl, was fatally shot inside her family's Detroit home in 2010 by police who burst into the wrong unit of a duplex while looking for a man suspected in a killing that had been committed days earlier. The suspect was eventually arrested in the second-floor unit of the duplex.\n\nAiyana was shot in the head while sleeping on a couch.\n\nJoseph Weekley, a member of an elite police unit, was the first officer through the door of her home. Weekley, who is white, said he accidentally fired his gun during a struggle with Aiyana's grandmother.\n\nWeekley was charged with involuntary manslaughter but his first trial ended without a verdict in 2013 and his second ended in 2015 with a hung jury. During the second trial, a judge dismissed that charge.\n\nBreonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was killed by police officers who knocked down the door to her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2020 while executing a drug search warrant that was later found to be flawed.\n\nTaylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a single shot that hit one of the officers as they came through the door of the apartment, and officers returned fire, striking Taylor in the apartment hallway multiple times.\n\nWalker told police investigators that he heard knocking but did not hear police announce themselves. He said he was \"scared to death,\" so he grabbed his gun and when the door was knocked down, he fired a shot.\n\nOfficers found no drugs in Taylor's apartment.\n\nFormer Louisville officer Brett Hankison, who is white, fired 10 shots into Taylor's window and glass door, was found not guilty in 2022 on state charges that he endangered her neighbors when he opened fire. Some of his shots flew into a neighboring apartment, but none of them struck anyone.\n\nLast year a jury deadlocked over federal civil rights charges that Hankison used excessive force that night. Federal prosecutors have said they intend to retry him.\n\nThree other former officers involved in drawing up the warrant were charged in a separate federal case. One of them, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty to helping falsify the warrant. She's expected to testify against the other two in the upcoming trial.", "source": {"uri": "ktar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTAR News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@ktar.com",

Body camera video viewed by reporters Thursday shows the Okaloosa County deputy arriving at the apartment building and speaking to a woman who described someone hearing an argument. The deputy then went up an elevator and walked down an outdoor hallway.\n\nOn the body camera video, the deputy can be heard yelling that he was from the sheriff's department and knocking, while also stepping seemingly out of view of the door. The video then shows Fortson opening the door with what appears to be a gun in his hand pointed toward the ground.\n\nThe deputy quickly fires several shots, yelling for Fortson to drop the gun after he is already on the ground wounded.\n\nAttorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, has said Fortson was talking to his girlfriend on FaceTime and grabbed his gun because he heard someone outside his apartment.\n\nCrump said in a Thursday statement that \"we remain adamant\" that law enforcement went to the wrong apartment. The sheriff rejects that assertion.\n\nBotham Jean, an 26-year-old Black man, was fatally shot in 2018 by a white police officer who mistook his Dallas apartment for her own.\n\nAmber Guyger was still in uniform after a long shift when she walked up to Jean's apartment -- which was on the fourth floor, directly above hers on the third -- and found the door unlocked.\n\nJean, an accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, had been eating a bowl of ice cream when Guyger entered his home and shot him. He was unarmed.\n\nGuyger, the former officer, was found guilty in 2019 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nAtatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old Black woman, was fatally shot through a window at her home in 2019 by Aaron Dean, a white officer, as he responded to a nonemergency call about the door to her Fort Worth, Texas, home being open.\n\nBody camera footage showed that Dean and a second officer didn't identify themselves as police at the house. Both testified at Dean's trial that they thought the house might have been burglarized and quietly moved into the fenced-off backyard looking for signs of forced entry.\n\nJefferson and her then-8-year-old nephew, Zion Carr, were up late playing video games. They'd left doors open to vent smoke after earlier burning hamburgers.\n\nCarr testified that Jefferson took out her gun because she believed there was an intruder in the backyard. Dean fired a single shot through the window a split-second after shouting at Jefferson, who was inside, to show her hands.\n\nDean was found guilty of manslaughter in 2022 and the former officer was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.\n\nAiyana Stanley-Jones, a 7-year-old Black girl, was fatally shot inside her family's Detroit home in 2010 by police who burst into the wrong unit of a duplex while looking for a man suspected in a killing that had been committed days earlier. The suspect was eventually arrested in the second-floor unit of the duplex.\n\nAiyana was shot in the head while sleeping on a couch.\n\nJoseph Weekley, a member of an elite police unit, was the first officer through the door of her home. Weekley, who is white, said he accidentally fired his gun during a struggle with Aiyana's grandmother.\n\nWeekley was charged with involuntary manslaughter but his first trial ended without a verdict in 2013 and his second ended in 2015 with a hung jury. During the second trial, a judge dismissed that charge.\n\nBreonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was killed by police officers who knocked down the door to her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2020 while executing a drug search warrant that was later found to be flawed.\n\nTaylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a single shot that hit one of the officers as they came through the door of the apartment, and officers returned fire, striking Taylor in the apartment hallway multiple times.\n\nWalker told police investigators that he heard knocking but did not hear police announce themselves. He said he was \"scared to death,\" so he grabbed his gun and when the door was knocked down, he fired a shot.\n\nOfficers found no drugs in Taylor's apartment.\n\nFormer Louisville officer Brett Hankison, who is white, fired 10 shots into Taylor's window and glass door, was found not guilty in 2022 on state charges that he endangered her neighbors when he opened fire. Some of his shots flew into a neighboring apartment, but none of them struck anyone.\n\nLast year a jury deadlocked over federal civil rights charges that Hankison used excessive force that night. Federal prosecutors have said they intend to retry him.\n\nThree other former officers involved in drawing up the warrant were charged in a separate federal case. One of them, Kelly Goodlett, has pleaded guilty to helping falsify the warrant. She's expected to testify against the other two in the upcoming trial.", "source": {"uri": "ktar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTAR News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@ktar.com",

(AP) -- Just two days before a sheriff's deputy in Florida shot him dead, U.S. Air Force airman Roger Fortson called home to find out what his 10-year-old sister wanted for her birthday.\n\nIt was a typical gesture for the 23-year-old from Atlanta, who doted on the girl and was devoted to helping her, a younger brother and his mom prosper, his family says.\n\n\"He was trying to give me everything that I never could get for myself,\" his mother, Chantemekki Fortson, said Thursday at a news conference in Fort Walton Beach, where her son was living when he was killed.\n\nHe was her \"gift,\" she said, the man who taught her to love and forgive and served as her co-worker and counselor.\n\nAn Okaloosa County sheriff's deputy shot Fortson on May 3. Sheriff's officials say he acted in self-defense while responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex. But civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the Fortson family, has accused the deputy of going to the wrong apartment and said the shooting was unjustified.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating.\n\nAt Thursday's news conference, Chantemekki Fortson held a large framed portrait of her son in dress uniform. He joined the Air Force in 2019, the same year he graduated from Ronald McNair -- a majority Black high school in metro Atlanta's DeKalb County where roughly half of students don't graduate in four years.\n\nAir Force service was a lifelong dream, and Fortson rose to the rank of senior airman. He was stationed at Hurlburt Field near Fort Walton Beach.\n\n\"Where we come from, we don't end up where Roger ended up,\" his mother said.\n\nFortson, a gunner aboard the AC-130J, earned an Air Medal with combat device, which is typically awarded after 20 flights in a combat zone or for conspicuous valor or achievement on a single mission. An Air Force official said Fortson's award reflected both -- completing flights in a combat zone and taking specific actions during one of the missions to address an in-flight emergency and allow the mission to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide additional details that had not been made public.\n\nBut his service, like almost everything else he did, had a larger purpose.\n\n\"He was trying to help his family have a better life,\" Crump said Thursday.\n\nThat meant serving as a role model for his 16-year-old brother, his mom said, saving up to try to buy her a house, and getting her a new car. His nickname was \"Mr. Make It Happen.\"\n\nChantemekki Fortson recalled that her son, then in high school, accompanied her in an ambulance to the hospital when she was giving birth to her daughter and tried to tell the doctor how to deliver the baby.\n\nThe girl and his brother were always in his thoughts. Fortson was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron as a special missions aviator, where one of his roles was to load the gunship's 30mm and 105mm cannons.\n\nChantemekki Fortson said her son was injured while loading a plane and was in such severe pain he thought he would die. But he told his mom he had to push through for his brother and sister.\n\nHe was also by her side when she got into an accident a short time later and needed to go the emergency room.\n\n\"That's the kind of gift he was,\" she said. \"They took something that can never be replaced.\"\n\n___\n\nThanawala reported from Atlanta.

The officer then asks the man to step back and after seeing a firearm, immediately shoots him six times. It's unclear in the bodycam footage if Fortson indeed had a gun in his hand. After he was shot, the officer yelled at him to \"drop the gun\". Fortson then replied with \"It's over there\" and said, \"I don't have it\".\n\nThe deputy then radios to alert nearby police officers that shots have been fired at the residence and to request that emergency medical services respond to the scene. The Air Force member was taken to a nearby hospital where he died from his injuries.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, Sheriff Eric Aden maintained that the deputy did knock on the correct door and that any statements made by the family and Ben Crump, the famed civil rights attorney retained to represent them, are inaccurate.\n\nThe deputy has been placed on paid administrative leave until a formal investigation into the matter and an administrative review are complete, per standard protocol.\n\nMr Crump told reporters at a separate news conference on Thursday that Fortson heard a knock at the door and replied \"Who is it?\" but did not get a response. He then said the service member heard a second knock and tried to look through the peephole to see who it was but it appeared as though someone had tried to cover it up.\n\nThe man then went to retrieve a firearm, which he legally had in his possession, the attorney said. When he returned, the deputy had busted through the door and was in the apartment, Crump said.\n\nThat narrative differs from what's shown in the bodycam footage.\n\nFortson's girlfriend was on the phone with him at the time of the shooting, the attorney continued. Once he was shot, she said she could see him on the ground saying \"I can't breathe\".\n\nThe man's family has called for a formal investigation into the matter. Sheriff Aden said that he has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to conduct the investigation, a step that is typical in such shootings. The state attorney's office will conduct an independent review.\n\nProving wrongdoing in the case could be difficult as most police policies allow officers to use force if they're presented with a firearm.\n\nChantimekki Fortson, the airman's mother, appeared at the Thursday news conference clutching onto a framed Air Force portrait of her son and sobbing onto a friend's shoulder.\n\nShe described the service member as intelligent and compassionate.\n\n\"Where we come from, you don't end up where Roger ended up,\" she said, speaking of her son's military accomplishments.\n\nAn Air Force spokesperson said Fortson had entered the service in November 2019.

Sheriff's officials say he acted in self-defense while responding to a call of a disturbance in progress at the apartment complex. But civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the Fortson family, has accused the deputy of going to the wrong apartment and said the shooting was unjustified.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating.\n\nAt Thursday's news conference, Chantemekki Fortson held a large framed portrait of her son in dress uniform. He joined the Air Force in 2019, the same year he graduated from Ronald McNair -- a majority Black high school in metro Atlanta's DeKalb County where roughly half of students don't graduate in four years.\n\nAir Force service was a lifelong dream, and Fortson rose to the rank of senior airman.

When the door opens, the deputy yells for Fortson, 23, to step back.\n\nAttorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, has said that Fortson got his legally owned gun after hearing knocking on his door and not hearing who was there. In a bodycam video released Thursday, the deputy initially knocks without announcing himself. About 30 seconds later, he knocks again, saying he's with the sheriff's office and to open the door. He knocks and announces himself approximately 10 seconds later. Within seconds of Fortson opening the door, the deputy shoots Fortson who is seen holding what appears to be a handgun at his side.\n\nFortson, who is blurred in the video, immediately falls to the ground. He's seen moving on the floor as the deputy tells him to drop his gun.\n\n\"It's over there,\" Fortson is heard on the video telling the deputy. \"I don't have it.\"\n\nThe deputy tells Fortson to not move and then calls on his radio for emergency medical services before the video ends.\n\nDuring a news conference, Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden told reporters, \"It pains me to show the video, but I know that you all need to see it.\"\n\nFortson's family said in a statement that it was troubling that the deputy fired multiple times so quickly.\n\n\"The video has provided some answers, but it's also raised even more troubling questions,\" the family said. \"As the officer didn't tell Roger to drop the weapon before shooting, was the officer trained to give verbal warnings? Did the officer try to initiate life-saving measures? Was the officer trained to deal with law-abiding citizens who are registered gun owners?\"\n\nDuring the incident, Fortson was on a FaceTime call with his girlfriend. Crump's firm released a video of the call that appears to start after the shooting, showing the ceiling of Fortson's apartment.\n\n\"I can't breathe,\" Fortson says in the video while groaning.\n\nNo law enforcement officers are seen in the video, but some voices in the background of the video can be heard.\n\n\"Do not move,\" a voice shouts to Fortson. \"Stop moving. Stop moving.\"\n\nFortson was shot six times, Crump's law firm said. As someone in the background counted how many gunshot wounds Fortson had, a voice says, \"Yeah, he's shot up.\"\n\nAden didn't take any questions during the afternoon news conference. The deputy, who hasn't been identified, has been placed on administrative leave, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the state attorney's office are investigating the shooting.\n\n\"These investigations take time, but I want to assure you that we are not hiding, covering up or taking action that would result in a rush to judgment of Mr. Fortson or our deputy,\" Aden said.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Crump said during a news conference Fortson was on FaceTime with his girlfriend when he heard knocking on his door, saw no one through the peephole and got his gun.\n\nCrump initially said the deputy entered Fortson's apartment, saw him with his gun and shot him. According to the family's statement after the bodycam video was released, the girlfriend thought the door was forced open by the deputy. The footage released during Aden's news conference showed the deputy firing several shots in an exterior hallway outside the door to Fortson's apartment.\n\n\"We remain adamant that the police had the wrong apartment as Roger was on the phone with his girlfriend for a substantial amount of time leading up to the shooting, and no one else was in the apartment,\" the family said.\n\nFortson's mother Chantemekki Fortson told reporters her son's girlfriend was devastated from the shooting.\n\n\"She literally watched them walk over him as he was dying, taking his last breath,\" Fortson said.\n\nCrump didn't identify the girlfriend but said she has an attorney.\n\n\"She was afraid that she just heard them and watch them kill her boyfriend,\" Crump told reporters.\n\nThe sheriff's office said in a statement Saturday the deputy was responding to a disturbance call, \"made contact with an armed individual at an apartment\" and acted in self-defense. In an updated statement Tuesday, Sheriff Eric Aden said the deputy \"encountered an armed man\" and shot him.\n\n\"All of us at the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office are saddened about the fatal officer-involved shooting over the weekend,\" Aden said.\n\nDuring his news conference, Aden said he met with Fortson's family and extended them his condolences.\n\n\"This result is one we never hope to encounter,\" the sheriff said.\n\nCrump said the family was going to view the bodycam footage Thursday afternoon. The family called for the footage to be released to the public and for the sheriff's office to correct what they've said about the shooting.\n\n\"Do the right thing and correct this narrative,\" Crump said. \"Correct this narrative and don't put a stain on the name of this young man ...

When the door opens, the deputy yells for Fortson, 23, to step back.\n\nAttorney Ben Crump, who is representing Fortson's family, has said that Fortson got his legally owned gun after hearing knocking on his door and not hearing who was there. In a bodycam video released Thursday, the deputy initially knocks without announcing himself. About 30 seconds later, he knocks again, saying he's with the sheriff's office and to open the door. He knocks and announces himself approximately 10 seconds later. Within seconds of Fortson opening the door, the deputy shoots Fortson who is seen holding what appears to be a handgun at his side.\n\nFortson, who is blurred in the video, immediately falls to the ground. He's seen moving on the floor as the deputy tells him to drop his gun.\n\n\"It's over there,\" Fortson is heard on the video telling the deputy. \"I don't have it.\"\n\nThe deputy tells Fortson to not move and then calls on his radio for emergency medical services before the video ends.\n\nDuring a news conference, Okaloosa County Sheriff Eric Aden told reporters, \"It pains me to show the video, but I know that you all need to see it.\"\n\nFortson's family said in a statement that it was troubling that the deputy fired multiple times so quickly.\n\n\"The video has provided some answers, but it's also raised even more troubling questions,\" the family said. \"As the officer didn't tell Roger to drop the weapon before shooting, was the officer trained to give verbal warnings? Did the officer try to initiate life-saving measures? Was the officer trained to deal with law-abiding citizens who are registered gun owners?\"\n\nDuring the incident, Fortson was on a FaceTime call with his girlfriend. Crump's firm released a video of the call that appears to start after the shooting, showing the ceiling of Fortson's apartment.\n\n\"I can't breathe,\" Fortson says in the video while groaning.\n\nNo law enforcement officers are seen in the video, but some voices in the background of the video can be heard.\n\n\"Do not move,\" a voice shouts to Fortson. \"Stop moving. Stop moving.\"\n\nFortson was shot six times, Crump's law firm said. As someone in the background counted how many gunshot wounds Fortson had, a voice says, \"Yeah, he's shot up.\"\n\nAden didn't take any questions during the afternoon news conference.

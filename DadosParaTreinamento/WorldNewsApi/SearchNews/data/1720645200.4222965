Perhaps it was somewhere in between. Regardless, Mavericks coach Jason Kidd stirred the pot Saturday when he nonchalantly called Jaylen Brown the Celtics\u2019 best player. When asked what makes facing Brown a tough challenge, Kidd raised some eyebrows in the room with his response. \u201cWell, Jaylen\u2019s their best player,\u201d Kidd told reporters. \u201cSo, just looking at what he does defensively, he picked up Luka [Doncic] full-court, he got to the free-throw line. He did everything. That\u2019s what your best player does.\u201d Kidd said Brown plays both sides at a high rate and has been doing so the whole playoffs. He noted that Brown earned Eastern Conference finals MVP honors and has picked up where he left off in the NBA Finals. He said the Mavericks need to be more physical with Brown and keep him off of the free-throw line and out of the paint. Brown said he has \u201cno reaction\u201d to Kidd\u2019s comments. \u201cI don\u2019t have no reaction,\u201d Brown told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a team game. We\u2019re trying to focus on that. Everybody has their own opinions.\u201d Brown finished Game 1 with 22 points on 7 of 12 shooting, along with 6 rebounds, 3 steals, three blocks, and 2 assists. Jayson Tatum was 6 of 16 for 16 points, plus 11 rebounds, 5 assists, 1 block, and 6 turnovers. Much has been made over the years, and recently as well, about Brown and Tatum\u2019s ability to coexist. They\u2019ve had tremendous success together, but haven\u2019t been able to get over the hump and win a title. While they\u2019re inching closer and closer to that goal, and playing incredibly well in tandem, Kidd\u2019s comments \u2013 perhaps by design \u2013 may add some fuel to the fire for Tatum heading into Game 2. Not that he needs any more. \u201cWe understand that people will try to drive a wedge between us, and I guess that\u2019s a smart thing to to do,\u201d Tatum told reporters, \u201cbut people have been trying to do that for years \u2026 It\u2019s not our first rodeo.\u201d Kidd did praise Tatum, noting he\u2019s not one to give in defensively and is also a very tough cover on the other end. \u201cJayson is one of the best offensive players in this league,\u201d Kidd told reporters.", "summary": "<p>\"He did everything.

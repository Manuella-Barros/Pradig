Recognized as a vital funding support for small businesses, TAP was at risk of losing 56.5% of its annual funding, or $13 million. This loss would have had widespread implications for the 4.1 million small businesses in California, nearly half of which are diverse-owned and are reliant on programs like TAP.<br /> <br /> \u201cThis is a victory for every voice that spoke up, whether in-person, online or in print against budget cuts to TAP.\u201d Said Allison Allain, president, NSBAC. \u201cIn this case, it didn\u2019t just take a village, it took a whole state work", "url": "https://kalkinemedia.com/news/world-news/national-small-business-advocacy-council-applauds-california-legislators-for-safeguarding-small-business-funding-program", "image": "https://kalkinemedia.com/storage/uploads/large/1719629329_667f76111e57b_21096544_business_team_celebrate_1200x628.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:49:29", "author": "Ein Presswire", "authors": ["Ein Presswire"], "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": 1.0}

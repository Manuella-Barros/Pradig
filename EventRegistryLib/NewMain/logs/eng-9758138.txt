THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris YoungTORONTO - Designated hitter Brandon Lowe smacked a two-run homer in the fifth inning to help the Tampa Bay Rays take a series-opening 4-2 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday. Trailing 3-0, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Justin Turner began the sixth inning with back-to-back homers off reliever Manuel Rodriguez. It was Guerrero's team-leading 17th and fourth homer in his last five games. Turner went three for four. But the bats for the home side went silent in the final three innings with nine straight outs before 38,575 at Rogers Centre. The defeat was the Blue Jays' (45-55) third in four starts since the all-star break, while the Rays (51-50) have won six of their last nine outings. Rays outfielder Justin Lowe singled home Randy Arozarena in the second after the latter led off the inning with a walk and stole second to get himself in scoring position for a 1-0 Rays advantage. Another walk came back to haunt Toronto starter Jose Berrios (8-8) when he issued a leadoff free pass to Richie Palacios. Brandon Lowe then clubbed a one-out, first-pitch line-drive into the right-field seats for his 11th homer. Berrios was not sharp. He struck out five and gave up three hits in his 4 2/3 innings but tied a career-high with six walks. This outing came on the heels of Berrios issuing four walks in each of his two outings before the All-Star break. Berrios walked three batters in the third inning to load the bases but got Lowe to fly out to centre on a leaping catch against the wall by Blue Jays centre-fielder Daulton Varsho. Shawn Armstrong opened the game on the mound for the Rays. He went two innings, giving up a single and a walk but striking out four. Tyler Alexander (3-3) tossed three shutout innings with three strikeouts and gave up three hits. Pete Fairbanks pitched the ninth for his 19th save. The Rays stole second three times on catcher Alejandro Kirk. In the seventh inning, Taylor Walls walked and then stole second. He advanced to third on an infield hit from Palacios that Guerrero failed to field cleanly. Walls then scored when Isaac Paredes hit into a double play. ON DECK Yariel Rodriguez (1-3) will start for the Blue Jays in the middle game of the three-game set against Tampa on Wednesday. The Rays will counter with righty Zach Eflin (5-7).

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris YoungTORONTO - Jose Berrios' search to find the form he exhibited earlier in the season has lingered longer than he would like. The Toronto Blue Jays starter walked six opponents to tie a career-high in a series-opening 4-2 defeat to the Tampa Bay Rays on Tuesday. Berrios (8-8) began 2024 winning his first four decisions. But he has been the victor just four times in the last three months and uncharacteristically followed up his four-walk outing before the all-star break with a couple more. \"I was frustrated with myself, throwing so many walks,\" said Berrios of his 97-pitch effort, in which the Rays were patient, swinging at only 32 pitches. Two of those walks turned into runs for the visitors. Right-fielder Josh Lowe singled home Randy Arozarena, who began the second inning with a walk. Designated hitter Brandon Lowe later smacked a two-run homer for a 3-0 lead in the fifth with Richie Palacios, who led off the inning with a walk. \"(Berrios) came out with really good stuff,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. \"He had a good fastball and then lost the zone. \"He had a good change-up and breaking ball but threw a hanger there for the homer. It was a weird outing for him.\" The last time Berrios issued six walks was on Aug. 9, 2018, when with the Minnesota Twins. Berrios stated he'd been looking at videos of himself earlier in the season in the hopes of finding some good vibrations. He denied 10 days of rest between starts was a factor. Instead, he blamed himself for trying to be too perfect by pitching at the outer edges of home plate.

Shawn Armstrong opened the game on the mound for the Rays. He went two innings, giving up a single and a walk but striking out four.

With the Blue Jays listed as a favorite and the total sitting at 8.5 runs, what is the smart play tonight from Toronto?\n\nAs of this writing, our MLB Public Betting Page shows that 74% of bets are on the Blue Jays' moneyline. That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nTampa Bay Rays DFS SPIN\n\nThe Rays dropped to 50-50 after losing to the Yankees 9-1 yesterday. Jose Siri provided Tampa Bay's only run of the game via a solo home run in the top of the 5 inning. Tampa will open up a series with the Blue Jays on Tuesday.\n\nToronto Blue Jays DFS SPIN\n\nThe Blue Jays improved to 45-54 after defeating the Tigers by one run on Sunday afternoon. George Springer had a big game, going 3-4 at the plate with a pair of home runs. Toronto looks to build some momentum as they host Tampa Bay for three games.\n\nThe Blue Jays are 4-6 SU in their last 10 games against Tampa.\n\nThe total has gone over in 4 of the last 5 home games for the Blue Jays.\n\nRays vs. Blue Jays MLB BETTING PREDICTION\n\nTake Toronto in the first five innings. I expect Jose Berrios to come out in the second half with an extra gear. Berrios has had a solid season, with an 8-7 record and 1.18 WHIP. On the mound for Tampa will be Shawn Armstrong who will serve as the opener. He has had a tough season thus far with a 5.91 ERA and a WHIP of 1.64. Tyler Alexander is likely to follow Armstrong and hasn't had much success either with an ERA of 6.19 ERA.

However, my Rays vs. Blue Jays predictions believe the home side can take an early lead with Jose Berrios on the mound.\n\nMy analysis\n\nThe second half of the season has been more of the same for the Toronto Blue Jays, dropping two of three to the Detroit Tigers in their first series coming out of the All-Star break.\n\nPreventing runs continued to be a problem, but the Jays are hoping Jose Berrios can put a stop to that tonight against the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nBerrios began the season very strong, pitching to a 2.93 ERA and a 1.10 WHIP over his first 14 starts. However, it appears he hit a wall in the latter part of the first half, but a little rest and a matchup with the Rays could get him back on track.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, Berrios has strong numbers against the Rays. He's made three starts against them since the start of last season and has given up just four earned runs on 15 hits, striking out 17 over 18 frames. Current Tampa batters have just a .227 xBA and a .296 xSLG vs. Berrios.\n\nThe Rays will counter Berrios with Shawn Armstrong, who will be used as an opener in this matchup. The 33-year-old RHP has pitched in 36 games this season (five starts) and has an ugly 5.60 xERA while surrendering a .286 xBA to opponents -- both rank in the Bottom 5%.\n\nTampa will follow Armstrong up with Tyler Alexander who was just recalled from Triple-A. Alexander made the team out of camp but was sent down after sporting a 6.19 ERA and a .828 opponent OPS over 11 games.\n\nAnd thanks to the likes of Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and George Springer, the Jays have been a respectable lineup over the last month, ranking 12th in batting average, 13th in OPS, and 14th in wRC+.\n\nI like the Jays to get off to a good start tonight, but their disastrous bullpen is shying me away from taking the full-game ML.\n\nSpeaking of Vladimir Guerrero Jr., the Blue Jays' lone All-Star picked up right where he left off before the break.\n\nVladdy has come out of the break by going 5-for-12 with two dingers and four RBI in the series against the Tigers. He's now hitting .292 with a .833 OPS, 16 home runs, and 69 RBI for the season, and I like him to drive in another one tonight.\n\nI'm actually a little surprised the Rays are opening the game with Armstrong because Vladdy owns him. Guerrero is a ridiculous 8-for-11 (.727) in his career against him. Now, he's just 2-for-14 against Alexander, but those two hits are a double and a dinger, and his xBA and xSLG of .347 and .639 tell you he's been hitting Alexander hard.\n\nVladdy has at least one RBI in five of his last seven games overall, and at this price, our MLB prop projections have Over 0.5 RBI as a five-star play.\n\nRays vs Blue Jays trend\n\nThe Blue Jays have hit the game total Over in 28 of their last 45 games for +12.60 Units and a 25% ROI.

Instead, he blamed himself for trying to be too perfect by pitching at the outer edges of home plate.\n\nThe defeat was the Blue Jays' (45-55) third in four starts since the all-star break, while the Rays (51-50) have won six of their last nine outings.\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. and Justin Turner began the sixth inning with back-to-back homers off reliever Manuel Rodriguez.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"It's fun to watch him right now,\" Schneider said of Guerrero.\n\n\"He's dangerous every single pitch.\"\n\nIt was Guerrero's team-leading 17th and fourth homer in his last five games.

Randy Arozarena broke up the no-hit bid with a leadoff double down the right-field line in the fifth inning.\n\nHe scored on a single from Josh Lowe that snuck under the glove of a diving Guerrero.\n\nRodriguez, a 27-year-old rookie, went 5 2/3 innings with six strikeouts, giving up a run on two hits and a walk. That walk to Richie Palacios scored the tying run in the sixth inning.\n\nLefty reliever Brendon Little also walked Brandon Lowe with two out. Arozarena cashed in Palacios with a hard-hit single to left.\n\nThe Blue Jays jumped out to a lead in the first inning. Spencer Horwitz smacked a one-out double to left-centre and scored on Guerrero's single to left field.\n\nGuerrero made it 2-0 in the third inning with a shot into the left-field seats with two out.\n\nThe solo shot was his team-leading 18th and fifth in his last six outings.\n\nBlue Jays reliever Genesis Cabrera (3-2) registered the win for his two-strikeout eighth inning.\n\nRays starter Zach Eflin also went 5 2/3 innings, allowing two runs on six hits with four strikeouts.\n\nKIERMAIER'S CONFESSION\n\nKevin Kiermaier told the Tampa Bay Times before the game that he would retire after the season. Toronto placed the 34-year-old four-time gold glove winner on waivers earlier this month.\n\n\"This is it, 2024 is it for me,\" the former Rays outfielder said. \"This next week will be very interesting (regarding a potential trade). But this will be my last year playing.\n\n\"I'm going to give it my all the rest of the year regardless of what situation I'm in. But my body is talking to me now more than ever.\"\n\nON DECK\n\nChris Bassitt (8-8) will start for the Blue Jays in the finale of the three-game set against Tampa on Thursday afternoon. The Rays will counter with righty Taj Bradley (5-4).\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 24, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global

He also walked six at Colorado on May 11, 2017.\n\nManager John Schneider called it \"a weird outing\" for Berr\u00edos.\n\n\"He had a good fastball and then lost the zone,\" Schneider said.\n\nThe right-hander, who lost at home for the second time in 10 starts this season, said his high walk total was the result of being too fine.\n\n\"I was trying to be perfect, throwing too much at the corners,\" Berr\u00edos said.\n\nJosh Lowe opened the scoring with an RBI single in the second. The Rays are 33-20 when they score first, and 18-30 when their opponent opens the scoring.\n\nVarsho's catch on Brandon Lowe's deep drive to center helped keep the Rays from scoring in the third, when they left the bases loaded.\n\nBrandon Lowe extended Tampa Bay's lead with a first-pitch drive in the fifth.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRays: Cash said Pepiot has returned to Florida but the pitcher's right knee remains swollen. ... Cash had no update on INF Yandy D\u00edaz, who remains away from the team for personal reasons.\n\nROSTER MOVES\n\nTampa Bay optioned RHP Tyler Zuber to Triple-A. ... The Rays claimed RHP Joel Kuhnel off waivers from Milwaukee.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP Yariel Rodr\u00edguez (1-3, 3.78 ERA) is scheduled to start for Toronto on Wednesday against Tampa Bay RHP Zach Eflin (5-7, 4.14).\n\n__\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Tampa Bay has won three of their last four.", "source": {"uri": "beaumontenterprise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beaumont

Randy Arozarena broke up the no-hit bid with a leadoff double down the right-field line in the fifth inning.\n\nHe scored on a single from Josh Lowe that snuck under the glove of a diving Guerrero.\n\nRodriguez, a 27-year-old rookie, went 5 2/3 innings with six strikeouts, giving up a run on two hits and a walk. That walk to Richie Palacios scored the tying run in the sixth inning.\n\nLefty reliever Brendon Little also walked Brandon Lowe with two out. Arozarena cashed in Palacios with a hard-hit single to left.\n\nThe Blue Jays jumped out to a lead in the first inning. Spencer Horwitz smacked a one-out double to left-centre and scored on Guerrero's single to left field.\n\nGuerrero made it 2-0 in the third inning with a shot into the left-field seats with two out.\n\nThe solo shot was his team-leading 18th and fifth in his last six outings.\n\nKevin Kiermaier told the Tampa Bay Times before the game that he would retire after the season. Toronto placed the 34-year-old four-time gold glove winner on waivers earlier this month.\n\n\"This is it, 2024 is it for me,\" the former Rays outfielder said. \"This next week will be very interesting (regarding a potential trade).

He had more reason to be frustrated Tuesday, when he scorched a ball to deep centerfield with two on in the third inning only to see Toronto's Daulton Varsho make a leaping catch at the wall.\n\nBut Lowe channeled that energy in his next at-bat, lacing a two-run homer to right that provided the winning margin in a 4-2 victory over the Blue Jays.\n\nThe win bumped the Rays back above .500 at 51-50 and kept them within 5-1/2 games of the final two American League wild-card spots, two factors that will determine their direction at the looming July 30 trade deadline. The Blue Jays fell to 45-55.\n\nWith scheduled starter Ryan Pepiot on the injured list due to a right knee infection that required hospitalization in New York, the Rays turned to the tandem of reliever Shawn Armstrong and just-called-back-up Tyler Alexander to cover the first five innings.\n\nThey did so without allowing a run. The Rays used four more relievers to finish the job, with Pete Fairbanks getting the final three outs.\n\nThe Rays grabbed an early 1-0 lead in the second inning, though they definitely could have had more.\n\nAfter not getting a runner into scoring position during Monday's 9-1 loss to the Yankees, the Rays, who have been struggling mightily in that area, converted their first chance Tuesday. Randy Arozarena drew a leadoff walk from Jose Berrios, stole second and scored on Josh Lowe's RBI single.\n\nThe Rays then went back to their old ways and wasted some prime opportunities. Jose Siri grounded into a double play that erased Josh Lowe. After Ben Rortvedt doubled, Jose Caballero grounded out.\n\nThe third inning was more frustrating for the Rays. They got two on with one-out walks to Richie Palacios and Isaac Paredes, but Brandon Lowe's liner to center was caught by the leaping Varsho. Arozarena walked to load the bases, but Josh Lowe grounded out.\n\nThe Rays finally added on in the fifth.\n\nPalacios drew a leadoff walk and stole second. After Paredes grounded out, Brandon Lowe made sure no one could catch his next drive, lacing the first pitch from Berrios 108 mph over the rightfield wall, his third homer in his last five games and 11th of the season.\n\nThe margin shrunk the next inning.\n\nAfter getting two zeroes from opener Armstrong and three from Alexander, manager Kevin Cash summoned Manuel Rodriguez to work the sixth. That didn't work out too well. Within his first seven pitches, Rodriguez allowed homers to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (his ninth in his last 23 games) and Justin Turner.\n\nRodriguez held the 3-2 lead, and the Rays added a run in the eighth. Taylor Walls walked, stole second and scored on a double play grounder, with Palacios helping the cause by getting into a rundown.\n\n* * *\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

Left-hander Tyler Alexander (3-3) followed and struck out four over three shutout innings.\n\nAlexander took a perfect game into the eighth when he last faced the Blue Jays, May 17 in Toronto.\n\nGuerrero greeted right-hander Manuel Rodr\u00edguez with a leadoff homer in the sixth, his fourth in five games. Justin Turner followed with a home run and the Blue Jays hit back-to-back homers for the first time this season.\n\nThe Rays replied with an insurance run against Nate Pearson in the seventh. Taylor Walls walked and stole second, then advanced on an infield single before scoring on a double-play groundout.\n\nPete Fairbanks finished for his 19th save in 21 chances.\n\nToronto's Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos (8-8) allowed three runs and three hits in 4 2/3 innings, his second straight losing start. The right-hander struck out five and matched a career-worst with six walks. He also walked six at Colorado on May 11, 2017.\n\nJosh Lowe opened the scoring with an RBI single in the second. The Rays are 33-20 when they score first, and 18-30 when their opponent opens the scoring.\n\nVarsho's catch on Brandon Lowe's deep drive to center helped keep the Rays from scoring in the third, when they left the bases loaded.\n\nBrandon Lowe extended Tampa Bay's lead with a first-pitch drive in the fifth.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRays: Manager Kevin Cash said Pepiot has returned to Florida but the pitcher's right knee remains swollen. ... Cash had no update on INF Yandy D\u00edaz, who remains away from the team for personal reasons.\n\nROSTER MOVES\n\nTampa Bay recalled Alexander from Triple-A Durham and optioned RHP Tyler Zuber to Triple-A. ... The Rays claimed RHP Joel Kuhnel off waivers from Milwaukee.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRHP Yariel Rodr\u00edguez (1-3, 3.78 ERA) is scheduled to start for Toronto on Wednesday against Tampa Bay RHP Zach Eflin

Yariel Rodriguez gets the ball for the Blue Jays and he's been rounding into form, while Rays starter Zach Eflin is in a bit of a slump.\n\nMy Rays vs. Blue Jays predictions break down this AL East matchup, finding you the best MLB picks to make at the ballpark tonight.\n\nMy analysis\n\nThings have not gone as expected for the Toronto Blue Jays this season. They enter tonight's affair 10 games below .500 and 10 games out of a postseason spot after dropping yesterday's opener to the Tampa Bay Rays. Big changes are likely coming to this team, but one guy likely to still be around next season is tonight's starter Yariel Rodriguez.\n\nThe Blue Jays signed Rodriguez out of Cuba this offseason, and after a rocky start to the season which included some injuries, it looks like the right-hander is settling in as a Big League pitcher.\n\nThe 27-year-old has made three starts this month and is pitching to a 1.62 ERA while limiting opponents to a .130 batting average. He's racked up 19 strikeouts in 16 2/3 innings and now gets a good matchup against the Rays.\n\nIt hasn't been a great season for the Rays either, sitting at 51-50, and producing runs has been arguably the biggest issue. Only the Mariners and White Sox have scored fewer runs than the Rays. Right-handers in particular have been a problem. Tampa Bay ranks 28th in batting average, 26th in OPS, and 21st in wRC+ when facing righties this season.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rays counter Rodriguez with a right-hander of their own in Zach Eflin. The veteran has been solid since joining the Rays last season but he's hit a bit of a slump, pitching to a 5.39 ERA and surrendering a .269 average over his last three starts.\n\nThe Blue Jays also have his number this season. Toronto has tagged Eflin for 10 earned runs on 15 hits in 11 2/3 innings over two starts. Current Jays batters have combined for a .265 expected batting average and a .417 expected slugging, with guys like Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and George Springer doing a ton of damage.\n\nOnce again, you can't trust the Blue Jays with a full-game moneyline bet thanks to that atrocious bullpen but I believe there's some value with them on the first-five moneyline tonight.\n\nIf the Toronto Blue Jays don't extend Vladimir Guerrero Jr., fire this entire franchise into the sun.\n\nThe All-Star first baseman has picked up right where he left off in the first half. Vladdy has come out of the break going 6-15 (.400) with three home runs and five RBI, and has been one of the best hitters in baseball for almost three months now.\n\nHe's hitting .324 with a .926 OPS, 14 home runs, and 49 RBI since May 5 and he gets a juicy matchup against Rays starter Zach Eflin. He's 4-for-13 with a double and a dinger in his career against Eflin, good for a .331 xBA and a .664 xSLG.\n\nHe's driven at least one run in six of his last eight games and three of four since the All-Star break. At +150, there's value in him to drive in another tonight and our Covers Prop Projections have this as a five-star play.\n\nRays vs Blue Jays trend\n\nThe Rays have only cashed the first-five moneyline in 28 of their last 84 games for -23.40 units and a -22% ROI.

He had more reason to be frustrated Tuesday, when he scorched a ball to deep center field with two on in the third inning only to see Toronto's Daulton Varsho make a leaping catch at the wall.\n\nBut Lowe channeled that energy in his next at-bat, lacing a two-run homer to right that provided the winning margin in a 4-2 victory over the Blue Jays.\n\nThe win bumped the Rays back above .500 at 51-50 and kept them within 5.5 games of the final two American League wild-card spots, two factors that will determine their direction at the looming July 30 trade deadline. The Blue Jays fell to 45-55.\n\nWith scheduled starter Ryan Pepiot on the injured list due to a right knee infection that required hospitalization in New York, the Rays turned to the tandem of reliever Shawn Armstrong and just-called-back-up Tyler Alexander to cover the first five innings.\n\nThey did so without allowing a run. The Rays used four more relievers to finish the job, with Pete Fairbanks getting the final three outs.\n\nThe Rays grabbed an early 1-0 lead in the second inning, though they definitely could have had more.\n\nAfter not getting a runner into scoring position during Monday's 9-1 loss to the Yankees, the Rays, who have been struggling mightily in that area, converted their first chance Tuesday. Randy Arozarena drew a leadoff walk from Jose Berrios, stole second and scored on Josh Lowe's RBI single.\n\nThe Rays then went back to their old ways and wasted some prime opportunities. Jose Siri grounded into a double play that erased Josh Lowe. After Ben Rortvedt doubled, Jose Caballero grounded out.\n\nThe third inning was more frustrating for the Rays. They got two on with one-out walks to Richie Palacios and Isaac Paredes, but Brandon Lowe's liner to center was caught by the leaping Varsho. Arozarena walked to load the bases, but Josh Lowe grounded out.\n\nThe Rays finally added on in the fifth.\n\nPalacios drew a leadoff walk and stole second. After Paredes grounded out, Brandon Lowe made sure no one could catch his next drive, lacing the first pitch from Berrios 108 mph over the rightfield wall, his third homer in his last five games and 11th of the season.\n\nThe margin shrunk the next inning.\n\nAfter getting two zeroes from opener Armstrong and three from Alexander, manager Kevin Cash summoned Manuel Rodriguez to work the sixth. That didn't work out too well. Within his first seven pitches, Rodriguez allowed homers to Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (his ninth in his last 23 games) and Justin Turner.\n\nRodriguez held the 3-2 lead, and the Rays added a run in the eighth. Taylor Walls walked, stole second and scored on a double play grounder, with Palacios helping the cause by getting into a rundown.", "source": {"uri": "tampabay.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It could drop them to as many as 5 1/2 games from the final American League wild-card spot.\n\nThe Jays jumped out to an early 2-0 lead.\n\nThey got one run in the first when Spencer Horwitz doubled off Eflin with one out and scored on a single by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. They added another in the third on a two-out homer by Guerrero, his fifth in his last six games, 11th in 26 and 18th this season.\n\nThe Rays eventually got even.\n\nAfter going 12 up and 12 down through the first four innings vs. Jays starter Yariel Rodriguez, the Rays got their first baserunner when Randy Arozarena doubled to lead off the fifth. Josh Lowe promptly singled him in.\n\nThe Rays had a chance for more when Jose Caballero drove a 1-1 pitch deep to left, but Daulton Varsho -- who robbed Brandon Lowe on Tuesday -- made a leaping catch at the wall.\n\nThe Rays got their second run in the sixth. Richie Palacios drew a one-out walk and stole second, then Brandon Lowe walked off reliever Brendon Little with two outs. Arozarena followed with an RBI single.\n\nThe Jays rally in the eighth started benignly, as George Springer walked with one out and stole second. One out later, the Rays intentionally walked Guerrero. Justin Turner then laced a liner toward third that Caballero seemed to have a play on but couldn't grab. That scored one run. A single down the right-field line by Varsho made it 4-2.\n\nIt got worse from there, as an Adam pitch that eluded catcher Ben Rortvedt (ruled a passed ball) scored another run. Then, normally sure-handed shortstop Taylor Walls misplayed a popup in shallow left with Arozarena closing in on him.\n\nEflin has been the subject of trade speculation, given his hefty increase in salary.

It could drop them to as many as 5-1/2 games from the final American League wild-card spot.\n\nThe Jays jumped out to an early 2-0 lead.\n\nThey got one run in the first when Spencer Horwitz doubled off Eflin with one out and scored on a single by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. They added another in the third on a two-out homer by Guerrero, his fifth in his last six games, 11th in 26 and 18th this season.\n\nThe Rays eventually got even.\n\nAfter going 12 up and 12 down through the first four innings vs. Jays starter Yariel Rodriguez, the Rays got their first baserunner when Randy Arozarena doubled to lead off the fifth. Josh Lowe promptly singled him in.\n\nThe Rays had a chance for more when Jose Caballero drove a 1-1 pitch deep to left, but Daulton Varsho -- who robbed Brandon Lowe on Tuesday -- made a leaping catch at the wall.\n\nThe Rays got their second run in the sixth. Richie Palacios drew a one-out walk and stole second, then Brandon Lowe walked off reliever Brendon Little with two outs. Arozarena followed with an RBI single.\n\nThe Jays rally in the eighth started benignly, as George Springer walked with one out and stole second. One out later, the Rays intentionally walked Guerrero. Justin Turner then laced a liner toward third that Caballero seemed to have a play on but couldn't grab. That scored one run. A single down the rightfield line by Varsho made it 4-2.\n\nIt got worse from there, as an Adam pitch that eluded catcher Ben Rortvedt (ruled a passed ball) scored another run. Then, normally sure-handed shortstop Taylor Walls misplayed a popup in shallow left with Arozarena closing in on him.\n\nEflin has been the subject of trade speculation, given his hefty increase in salary. He's due to make $18 million for 2025 after making $11 million in 2023 and this season. The Astros, Braves and Cardinals are among the teams expected to have strong interest, with the deadline at 6 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nAfter throwing 30 pitches in the first inning, Eflin became impressively efficient, needing just 55 more to get two outs into the sixth. He allowed the two runs and six hits while striking out four.\n\n* * *\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

Brandon Lowe belted a two-run homer for Tampa Bay, which holds a 5-3 edge in the season series.\n\nThe Rays were at .500 for the 23rd time this season, a club record, after a 9-1 loss to the New York Yankees on Monday. The previous team record was 22 set in 2017. They last were two games above .500 when they entered play at 25-23.\n\nThe Rays improved to 3-2 on their seven-game road trip. Toronto is 1-3 to start a nine-game homestand.\n\nThe Blue Jays are turning to right-hander Yariel Rodriguez (1-3, 3.78 ERA) in a bid to even the series.\n\nThe Rays are scheduled to start right-hander Zach Eflin (5-7, 4.14), who is 2-3 with a 6.35 ERA in seven games (six starts) against the Blue Jays.\n\nEflin has faced Toronto twice this season. He did not factor into the decision in his May 18 start at Toronto when he allowed four runs and nine hits in six innings. He took the loss at St. Petersburg, Fla., on March 28, when he yielded six runs and six hits -- including three homers -- in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nRight-hander Ryan Pepiot (right knee infection) was slated to start for Tampa Bay on Tuesday but is on the injured list after entering a hospital in New York, where the Rays split a four-game series with the Yankees. He was released from hospital on Monday.\n\n\"He's doing well,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said. \"I saw a picture of (his knee), and it's still swollen, but he's doing much better.\"\n\nPepiot is eligible to be reinstated Aug. 3, and Cash said he should be able to get back to throwing soon.\n\nIn his absence, the Rays opened with Shawn Armstrong and followed with Tyler Alexander. They combined to scatter four hits and struck out eight over five scoreless innings. Alexander was recalled from Triple-A Durham for the outing and reliever Tyler Zuber was demoted.\n\nThe Rays claimed reliever Joel Kuhnel off waivers from the Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday.\n\nCash said before the game on Tuesday that there still was \"no update\" on the status of Yandy Diaz (personal), who is not with the team.\n\nHome runs by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Justin Turner provided the offense for Toronto on Tuesday. Turner added two singles.\n\nGuerrero leads the team with 17 home runs, including four in his past six games.\n\n\"It's fun to watch him right now,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. \"He's dangerous every single pitch.\"\n\nOver his past 24 games, Guerrero is batting .340 (32-for-94) with nine doubles, nine homers and 29 RBIs.\n\nTurner continued to hit well against American League East rivals. He is batting .318 (27-for-85) with six doubles, three home runs and 12 RBIs in 25 games against them.\n\nInfielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa (sprained left knee) took batting practice on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's been way faster than I expected,\" Kiner-Falefa said. \"I wish I could have been playing throughout that stretch on the West Coast and just helping the team put ourselves in a better situation. At the same time, I feel like this is a good time for these young guys to learn and get better.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Jose Berrios was really struggling today, unable to locate with any consistency. His stuff actually looked good, and he got his share of strikeouts, but six walks is never going to end well, and if a few balls to the track hadn't been caught it could have been much worse. That's two rough starts in a row, after his 4.0 IP, 5 run outing on the 13th, which also involved significant control problems.\n\nOn offense, nothing ever got going. They managed just six hits and a walk, while striking out 10 times.\n\nJose Berrios was uncharacteristically without his control tonight. He started off well, with a 1-2-3 first inning featuring a pair of strikeouts.\n\nThe Rays got on the board in the second, though. Randy Arozarena worked a lead off walk, and then was able to come all the way around to score on a Josh Lowe line single. A double play erased the runner, which was fortunate because the next batter lined a double just past a diving George Springer. Berrios was able to induce a ground out to escape.\n\nHe got himself into a real jam in the third, walking two with one out. He was saved by a leaping grab at the wall from Daulton Varsho that robbed Brandon Lowe of what would have been a two run double. He walked the next batter as well, loading the bases, but a fly out to centre, this one routine, let him off the hook.\n\nBerrios issued a fifth walk in the fourth inning and needed another (but less dramatic) Varsho catch at the wall to escape. He was less lucky in the fifth. He walked the leadoff man, Richie Palacios, the sixth of the night to tie a career nadir from way back in 2018. Palacios stole second, but it ended up being an unnecessary effort because one batter later Brandon Lowe launched a home run into the visitors bullpen to put Tampa up 3-0. Berrios got one more batter. His fina line was 4.2 IP, 3 runs on 3 hits and 6 walks while punching out 5. 3 runs in 4.2 is poor but not disastrous, but he's lucky a couple more of his mistakes weren't deposited into the outfield seats. Brendon Little sat down Josh Lowe looking to clean up the fifth.\n\nThe Jays weren't able to get anything done against opener Shawn Armstrong. They did get two on in the first, when Vladimir Guerrero worked a walk and Justin Turner followed with a ground ball through the right side, but couldn't cash them in. They went down in order in the second.\n\nThe early results off bulk pitcher Tyler Alexander weren't much better. Leo Jimenez lead off the third with a soft line single to right, but again the rest of the offence could do nothing with it.\n\nSimilarly, a Turner line single and a Varsho grounder up the middle put two on with one out, but a ground out and a soft fly out wasted the opportunity. They went down in order in the fifth.\n\nBrendon Little came back in the sixth and got the first two batters, and Ryan Burr took over and got the third. The Rays went to Manuel Rodriguez in the home half. They should have stayed with Alexander. Vlad lead off with a line drive home run to centre, and Justin Turner followed with a fly over the home dugout to cut the Ray' advantage to 3-2.\n\nNate Pearson walked Taylor Walls to open the seventh. Walls stole second (the Jays challenged and lost) and advanced to third on a Richie Palacios single. Isaac Paredes grounded into a double play, but that was enough to bring Walls across and increase the lead back to two. The Jays weren't able to respond, with Kevin Kelly sitting them down in order in their half of the inning.\n\nGenesis Cabrera was sharp in the eighth, racking up a couple of Ks in a clean inning. Unfortunately, Jason Adam also sat the Jays down in order.\n\nErik Swanson had a decent ninth. He issued a walk but that was all, and also recorded a strikeout while sitting 95. That's two solid outings since he's been back from his reset in Buffalo. Pete Fairbanks came on and secured the save for Tampa. Alejandro Kirk hit one to the track in right, his second really solidly hit fly of the night, but it was caught for the final out.\n\nJays of the Day: Only Turner (0.190) hit the number, but Varsho gets a bonus one for his glove work.\n\nNope: Berrios (-0.097) was just below the number, but realistically he deserves it. Horwitz (-0.102), Schneider (-0.127), and Clement (-0.108) got there.\n\nWe're back tomorrow at 7:07pm ET. Zach Eflin (5-7, 4.14) will go for Tampa, while Yariel Rodriguez (1-3, 3.78) represents the home squad.", "source": {"uri": "bluebirdbanter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bluebird Banter"},

They fell 5 1/2 games behind their rivals in the battle to be out of the basement.\n\nThere's an old baseball adage that walks will kill you, and they did Tuesday night.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJays starter Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos matched his career high by issuing a half-dozen free passes over 4 2/3 innings, an outing shortened by his lack of control. The right-hander threw 97 pitches in recording just 14 outs.\n\nHis first walk was to Randy Arozarena leading off the second inning, and the speedy Rays left fielder came around to score the game's first run, stealing second base before Josh Lowe brought him home with a single.\n\nBerr\u00edos, though, stranded the next four batters he walked and it appeared as though he was going to be able to escape serious damage until the sixth base on balls, to Richie Palacios leading off the fifth inning, was followed by a Lowe home run two batters later.\n\nWhile the starter was walking the world -- thanks again to John Gibbons for that great turn of phrase -- the offence was shooting blanks, with four singles and a walk scattered over the first five innings.\n\nThe crowd of 38,575 looked up from their 65,376 loonie dogs in the bottom of the sixth to see Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Justin Turner start the inning with back-to-back home runs, cutting the Jays' deficit to one.\n\nIt was Guerrero's fourth home run in five games and his team-leading 17th of the season. For Turner, it was his first in more than a month. The Jays DH hadn't gone deep since belting a solo shot off Boston's Nick Pivetta on June 17, a span of 92 plate appearances.\n\nBut that was it; the next 12 Jays hitters were retired in order.\n\nThe Rays added an insurance run off Nate Pearson in the eighth on a double-play ball by Isaac Paredes.

While his ERA sits at 4.14, he has an xERA of 3.37 behind elite control that is in the 98th percentile in terms of walk rate.\n\nToronto Blue Jays\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr: Finally in a rhythm, Guerrero Jr. is starting to look like the superstar we have come to expect, hitting nearly .300 on the year (.293) with a 95th percentile xSLG.\n\nRays vs. Blue Jays Prediction and Pick\n\nBlue Jays rookie Yariel Rodriguez may have a 3.78 ERA, but his underlying metrics indicate he's in for a rough end of the season.\n\nThe right-hander has poor control, eighth percentile walk rate, and has been crushed by hard contact, 16th percentile. He has an xERA of 4.16 and is not getting many chases outside of the strike zone.\n\nI believe Tampa Bay has the offense to punish Rodriguez early and put pressure on a below-average set of relievers.

The Blue Jays have gotten to him twice this season, but this one could be different. Eflin has a low WHIP, and he keeps his walks down. Eflin also has a pretty high chase percentage, which is why his walk rate is down this season. The Blue Jays will get themselves out, so Eflin needs to pitch his game. If he can get the Blue Jays to chase off the plate, the Rays will be able to win this game.\n\nTampa Bay currently leads the season series with the Blue Jays 5-3. They have been able to beat the Blue Jays in a lot of close games. As a team, the Rays are batting .240 against the Blue Jays, and they have scored 32 runs in eight games played. That is just four runs per game, but they have been able to put up some big games, as well. Nonetheless, the Rays have been playing well against Toronto this season, and that should continue in this game.\n\nWhy The Blue Jays Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nYariel Rodriguez is pitching well this month. He has made three starts, and has not allowed more than 2 runs in any of them. In fact, Rodriguez has an ERA of 1.62 for the month of July. In his 16.2 innings pitched this month, Rodriguez has allowed just seven hits. He seems to have found his stride, and that needs to continue for him in this game. If he keeps pitching as he has been, the Blue Jays will win this game.\n\nThe Blue Jays have faced Eflin twice this season. In those games, the Blue Jays have been able to really get to him. They have scored 10 runs on 15 hits against Eflin, and Eflin has thrown just 11.2 innings against Toronto. The Blue Jays should be able to do that same type of damage off Eflin in this game, as well. They are going to get a lot of pitches over the plate, Toronto just has to capitalize. As long as they do that, the Blue Jays will win this game.\n\nFinal Rays-Blue Jays Prediction & Pick\n\nThis should be a close game. I do like what Rodriguez has done this season, though. I will take the Blue Jays to win this game straight up.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Eflin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Eflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rays-vs.-Blue-Jays-prediction-odds-pick-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758138", "eventUri": "eng-9758138", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

The Rays also had some very dumb miscues, which is normally our job in this rivalry. It was a good one all around.\n\nYariel Rodriguez got off to a great start, striking out four across four perfect innings. He was hitting his spots with all five pitches and had the Rays off balance. He also added in a nice play fielding a bunt.\n\nThey caught up to him a little in the fifth. Randy Arozarena lead off with a double, and a Josh Lowe ground ball that just got under a diving Vladimir Guerrero jr.'s glove brought him in to score, making it 2-1 Toronto. A questionable balk call (but then they all are) advanced lowe to second, and after Rodriguez recorded his fifth strikeout he came to third on a Ben Rortvedt ground out. Jose Caballero hit a ball to the wall in left that would have tied it and left the go ahead run in scoring position, but Daulton Varsho made a phenomenal leaping catch (as usual) to end the inning. On replay, it looked like the ball might actually have bounced off the wall and down into Varsho's glove, but the Rays opted not to challenge.\n\nRodriguez came back for the start of the sixth, getting two outs and issuing a walk. At this point John Schneider called on Brendon Little to face the lefty Brandon Lowe. Rodroguez was only at 73 pitches and hadn't been stressed much, but he'd also faced 20 batters, which is about where they've limited him this season. It seemed early to me, but not egregiously so. Anyway, it didn't work, as Little walked Lowe and allowed the tieing run to score from second on a Randy Arozarena ground ball single.\n\nRodriguez ended up going 5.2 with 2 runs on 2 hits and a walk, striking out 6. He really deserved to be in a position to win tonight.\n\nThe offence wasn't great against Zach Eflin. They did get on him early, with a Spencer Horwitz double to the wall in left centre and a Vlad line single putting them up 1-0 in the first.\n\nVlad would extend the lead to 2 in the third inning with a moonshot into the left field seats. Those were the only runs they'd manage off him, though. They did get two hits off him in the sixth, a lead off Horwitz line single and after a double play a Justin Turner single to knock him out of the game. Garrett Clevinger got a ground out to end the inning.\n\nWith the game now tied, Chad Green and Manuel Rodriguez traded clean sevenths.\n\nGenesis Cabrera worked around a walk to record a scoreless top of the eighth with a pair of punch outs. Jason Adam had a rougher time in the home half. Springer worked a walk and stole second with one out. After a Spencer Horwitz strikeout, the Rays opted to take advantage of the open base, intentionally walking Guerrero. That proved to be a mistake. A Justin Turner liner slashed to left scored Springer, giving the Jays back the lead. Varsho followed with a single of his own to score Vlad, and a passed ball by Rortvedt allowrd Turner to cross. Alejandro Kirk popped up to shallow left, which should have ended it, but shortstop Taylor Walls and left fielder Randy Arozarena got their wires crossed and in the confusion the kicked off the heel of Walls' glove, scoring Varsho. An Ernie Clement ground out finally ended it, but Toronto was now out front 6-2.\n\nYimi Garcia had to work for the save. Randy Arozarena worked an eight pitch walk and came home on a Rortvedt double, but he got a couple of Ks and a ground out to lock it down there.\n\nIt's a day game tomorrow. Taj Bradley (5-4, 2.63) gets the call for the Rays, while Chris Bassitt (8-8, 3.71) goes to work for the home team.

Mandatory Credit: Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports / Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTwo AL East foes continue a mid-week set against one another on Wednesday night in Toronto.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays will hope that Zach Eflin can get on the right side of some variance and put together a strong second half of the season against a Toronto Blue Jays team that hasn't be consistent enough to stay firmly in the Wild Card race.\n\nZach Eflin: One of the prime positive regression candidates for the second half of the season, Eflin can pounce on a strong underlying profile. While his ERA sits at 4.14, he has an xERA of 3.37 behind elite control that is in the 98th percentile in terms of walk rate.\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr: Finally in a rhythm, Guerrero Jr. is starting to look like the superstar we have come to expect, hitting nearly .300 on the year (.293) with a 95th percentile xSLG.\n\nBlue Jays rookie Yariel Rodriguez may have a 3.78 ERA, but his underlying metrics indicate he's in for a rough end of the season.\n\nThe right-hander has poor control, eighth percentile walk rate, and has been crushed by hard contact, 16th percentile. He has an xERA of 4.16 and is not getting many chases outside of the strike zone.\n\nI believe Tampa Bay has the offense to punish Rodriguez early and put pressure on a below-average set of relievers.

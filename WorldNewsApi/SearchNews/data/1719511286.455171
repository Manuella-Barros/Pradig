Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, led the group of lawmakers on the trip to Taipei soon after the Chinese government conducted military drills around the island. Mr. McCaul, Texas Republican, said he knew Chinese President Xi Jinping was watching to see if America would support its friends. Taiwan last week inaugurated its new president, William Lai, and Mr. McCaul praised Taiwan\u2019s \u201cthriving democracy.\u201d \u201cThe U.S. will continue to stand by our steadfast partner and work to maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Mr. McCaul said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to meeting with Taiwan officials to better understand what America can do to preserve peace in Asia and build upon our shared democratic values.\u201d The five lawmakers joining Mr. McCaul include Republican Reps. Andy Barr of Kentucky, Young Kim of California and Joe Wilson of South Carolina; and Democratic Reps. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Jimmy Panetta of California. The Republicans are members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the Democrats are members of the House Armed Services Committee. After Mr. McCaul announced the delegation\u2019s planned travel earlier this month, the Chinese government sharply criticized the congressional visit. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin warned U.S. government officials to stay away from Taiwan last week and said \u201call consequences\u201d that resulted would be borne by America. \u201cThe U.S. Congress is part of the U.S. government and supposed to strictly adhere to the one China policy followed by the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Wang said at a press conference. \u201cAny visit by congressional members to Taiwan will seriously violate the one-China principle.\u201d Beijing surrounded Taiwan with dozens of aircraft and warships last week as part of military drills demonstrating strangulation tactics. The U.S. lawmakers\u2019 visit to Taiwan is hardly unprecedented, as Mr. McCaul led a delegation to visit the island in April 2023. Such visits provoke outrage in Beijing, however, such as when then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrived in 2022. The Chinese regime responded with a crush of military maneuvers near Taiwan. The presence of U.S. lawmakers in Taipei is welcomed by Taiwanese officials who wish to show they are not deterred by the Chinese government\u2019s intimidation efforts. At a celebration with U.S. lawmakers in Washington last week, Taiwan\u2019s representative to the U.S. Alexander Tah-Ray Yui said world leaders visiting Taiwan were as important as displays of military might. Mr. Yui told reporters that the visit by Mr. McCaul and other lawmakers would send a powerful message to the Chinese government that \u201cwe\u2019re not alone.\u201d", "summary": "Six House lawmakers arrived Sunday in Taiwan to meet with the democratically run island's new administration despite threats from China urging the U.S. representatives to stay away.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/may/26/house-lawmakers-arrive-in-taiwan-amid-chinese-gove/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/05/23/Pictures_of_the_Week_Asia_Photo_Gallery_85114.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:35:40", "author": "Ryan Lovelace", "authors": ["Ryan Lovelace"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.105}

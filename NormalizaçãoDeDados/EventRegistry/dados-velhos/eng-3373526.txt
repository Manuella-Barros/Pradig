Really good at-bats from a lot of different people,\" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. \"It's frustrating, but we'll be back.\"\n\nReed (1-1) got five outs, striking out three. He was the seventh Boston pitcher, after starter Drew Pomeranz left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth. Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nThe Red Sox opened a 3-0 lead on homers from Christian Vazquez and Rafael Devers, who hit his fourth in five games and his seventh in his 19-game major league career. But Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer in the sixth, then New York scored four in the seventh to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nWINNING RALLY\n\nBoston loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh against Tommy Kahnle (2-4), scored one run on Mookie Betts' sacrifice fly and another on Andrew Benintendi's single. Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases again before Moreland lined an 0-2 pitch to center to make it 7-6.\n\nJackie Bradley Jr. hit a two-run single in the eighth off Aroldis Chapman to make it 9-6.\n\nKahnle recorded just two outs, allowing two runs on three hits and a walk. Gary Sanchez and Frazier homered, and Brett Gardner and Chase Headley had three hits apiece for the Yankees. Aaron Hicks was hit by a pitch twice.\n\nJUDGE\n\nJudge came up with two outs and the bases loaded in the sixth after the Yankees had already scored twice to make it 3-2. With Kelly pitching, Judge fouled off two 100 mph pitches with two strikes and laid off a 101 mph fastball to work the count full before grounding out to the shortstop.\n\nJudge came up again with one out and the bases loaded in the seventh after the Yankees had already scored four times. He got ahead 3-1 before fouling one off, then Reed beat him with a 94 mph fastball.\n\n\"He just got the best of me that time,\" Judge said. Of the Kelly at-bat, he said: \"He's getting up there 100, 101 (mph). Those are the at-bats you want to be in, big situation, based loaded and try to come through there. But I wasn't able to get the job done.\"\n\nThe seventh-inning whiff extended his strikeout streak to 35 consecutive games. He had already broken the record for position players, and now he's tied with pitcher Bill Stoneman (1971) for the longest in a single season.\n\nDREW'S DAY\n\nPomeranz was pulled from the game after throwing his second pitch to Headley in the fourth. After talking with manager John Farrell and the training staff, Brandon Workman was called in from the bullpen to relieve him.\n\n\"We're not going to take any chance right now,\" Farrell said. \"He's been getting treatment throughout the game, and we'll she where he is tomorrow.\"\n\nPomeranz, who had won six straight decisions, left with a 2-0 lead. He was charged with four hits and a walk, striking out four in 3 1/3 innings.\n\nTONY C.\n\nThe Red Sox unveiled a display in Fenway Park to honor former outfielder Tony Conigliaro, who was nearly killed when blinded when he was beaned by Jack Hamilton of the California Angels on Aug. 18, 1967. The display included Conigliaro's helmet, a jersey and AL championship ring from the '67 season.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka threw in the bullpen on Friday and is expected to come off the DL (right shoulder inflammation) to start in Detroit next week.\n\nRed Sox: LHP David Price hasn't been able to throw since Tuesday because of soreness. Manager John Farrell conceded time is running out for Price to get his strength back before the postseason.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: CC Sabathia (9-5) is trying to snap a personal two-game losing streak.\n\nRed Sox: Chris Sale (14-4) gets the start.

He got ahead 3-1 before fouling one off, then Reed beat him with a 94 mph fastball.\n\n\"He just got the best of me that time,\" Judge said. Of the Kelly at-bat, he said: \"He's getting up there 100, 101 (mph). Those are the at-bats you want to be in, big situation, based loaded and try to come through there. But I wasn't able to get the job done.\"\n\nThe seventh-inning whiff extended his strikeout streak to 35 consecutive games. He had already broken the record for position players, and now he's tied with pitcher Bill Stoneman (1971) for the longest in a single season.\n\nDrew's day\n\nPomeranz was pulled from the game after throwing his second pitch to Headley in the fourth. After talking with manager John Farrell and the training staff, Brandon Workman was called in from the bullpen to relieve him.\n\n\"We're not going to take any chance right now,\" Farrell said. \"He's been getting treatment throughout the game, and we'll she where he is tomorrow.\"\n\nPomeranz, who had won six straight decisions, left with a 2-0 lead. He was charged with four hits and a walk, striking out four in 3 1/3 innings.\n\nTony C.\n\nThe Red Sox unveiled a display in Fenway Park to honor former outfielder Tony Conigliaro, who was nearly killed when blinded when he was beaned by Jack Hamilton of the California Angels on Aug. 18, 1967.

Really good at-bats from a lot of different people,\" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. \"It's frustrating, but we'll be back.\"\n\nReed (1-1) got five outs, striking out three. He was the seventh Boston pitcher, after starter Drew Pomeranz left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth. Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nThe Red Sox opened a 3-0 lead on homers from Christian Vazquez and Rafael Devers, who hit his fourth in five games and his seventh in his 19-game major league career.

Gary Sanchez and Frazier homered, and Brett Gardner and Chase Headley had three hits apiece for the Yankees. Aaron Hicks was hit by a pitch twice.\n\nJUDGE\n\nJudge came up with two outs and the bases loaded in the sixth after the Yankees had already scored twice to make it 3-2.

Really good at-bats from a lot of different people,\" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. \"It's frustrating, but we'll be back.\"\n\nGSA gives per diem travel rates another bump for 2018\n\nReed (1-1) got five outs, striking out three. He was the seventh Boston pitcher, after starter Drew Pomeranz left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth. Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nThe Red Sox opened a 3-0 lead on homers from Christian Vazquez and Rafael Devers, who hit his fourth in five games and his seventh in his 19-game major league career. But Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer in the sixth, then New York scored four in the seventh to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nWINNING RALLY\n\nBoston loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh against Tommy Kahnle (2-4), scored one run on Mookie Betts' sacrifice fly and another on Andrew Benintendi's single. Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases again before Moreland lined an 0-2 pitch to center to make it 7-6.\n\nJackie Bradley Jr. hit a two-run single in the eighth off Aroldis Chapman to make it 9-6.\n\nKahnle recorded just two outs, allowing two runs on three hits and a walk. Gary Sanchez and Frazier homered, and Brett Gardner and Chase Headley had three hits apiece for the Yankees. Aaron Hicks was hit by a pitch twice.\n\nJUDGE\n\nJudge came up with two outs and the bases loaded in the sixth after the Yankees had already scored twice to make it 3-2. With Kelly pitching, Judge fouled off two 100 mph pitches with two strikes and laid off a 101 mph fastball to work the count full before grounding out to the shortstop.\n\nJudge came up again with one out and the bases loaded in the seventh after the Yankees had already scored four times. He got ahead 3-1 before fouling one off, then Reed beat him with a 94 mph fastball.\n\n\"He just got the best of me that time,\" Judge said. Of the Kelly at-bat, he said: \"He's getting up there 100, 101 (mph). Those are the at-bats you want to be in, big situation, based loaded and try to come through there. But I wasn't able to get the job done.\"\n\nThe seventh-inning whiff extended his strikeout streak to 35 consecutive games. He had already broken the record for position players, and now he's tied with pitcher Bill Stoneman (1971) for the longest in a single season.\n\nDREW'S DAY\n\nPomeranz was pulled from the game after throwing his second pitch to Headley in the fourth. After talking with manager John Farrell and the training staff, Brandon Workman was called in from the bullpen to relieve him.\n\n\"We're not going to take any chance right now,\" Farrell said. \"He's been getting treatment throughout the game, and we'll she where he is tomorrow.\"\n\nPomeranz, who had won six straight decisions, left with a 2-0 lead. He was charged with four hits and a walk, striking out four in 3 1/3 innings.\n\nTONY C.\n\nThe Red Sox unveiled a display in Fenway Park to honor former outfielder Tony Conigliaro, who was nearly killed when blinded when he was beaned by Jack Hamilton of the California Angels on Aug. 18, 1967. The display included Conigliaro's helmet, a jersey and AL championship ring from the '67 season.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka threw in the bullpen on Friday and is expected to come off the DL (right shoulder inflammation) to start in Detroit next week.\n\nRed Sox: LHP David Price hasn't been able to throw since Tuesday because of soreness. Manager John Farrell conceded time is running out for Price to get his strength back before the postseason.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: CC Sabathia (9-5) is trying to snap a personal two-game losing streak.\n\nRed Sox: Chris Sale (14-4) gets the start.

New York snapped a four-game winning streak.\n\nAddison Reed (1-1) got five outs, striking out three. He was the seventh Boston pitcher, after starter Drew Pomeranz left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth. Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nThe Red Sox opened a 3-0 lead on homers from Rafael Devers and Christian Vazquez. But Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer in the sixth, then New York scored four in the seventh to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nBoston loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh against Tommy Kahnle (2-4), scored one run on Mookie Betts' sacrifice fly and another on Andrew Benintendi's single. Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases again before Moreland lined an 0-2 pitch to center to make it 7-6.\n\nJackie Bradley Jr. hit a two-run single in the eighth off Aroldis Chapman to make it 9-6.\n\nKahnle recorded just two outs, allowing two runs on three hits and a walk.

With Joe Kelly pitching, Judge fouled off two 100 mph pitches with two strikes and laid off a 101 mph fastball to work the count full before grounding out to the shortstop.\n\nJudge had one hit in four at-bats while extending his strikeout streak to 35 consecutive games. He had already broken the record for position players, and now he's tied with pitcher Bill Stoneman (1971) for the longest in a single season.\n\nDREW'S DAY\n\nPomeranz was pulled from the game after throwing his second pitch to Headley in the fourth.

New York snapped a four-game winning streak.\n\nAddison Reed (1-1) got five outs, striking out three. He was the seventh Boston pitcher, after starter Drew Pomeranz left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth. Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nThe Red Sox opened a 3-0 lead on homers from Rafael Devers and Christian Vazquez. But Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer in the sixth, then New York scored four in the seventh to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nBoston loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh against Tommy Kahnle (2-4), scored one run on Mookie Betts' sacrifice fly and another on Andrew Benintendi's single. Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases again before Moreland lined an 0-2 pitch to center to make it 7-6.\n\nJackie Bradley Jr. hit a two-run single in the eighth off Aroldis Chapman to make it 9-6.\n\nKahnle recorded just two outs, allowing two runs on three hits and a walk. Gary Sanchez and Frazier homered, and Brett Gardner and Chase Headley had three hits apiece for the Yankees. Aaron Hicks was hit by a pitch twice.\n\nDevers' homer was his fourth in five games and his seventh in his 19-game major league career.\n\nJUDGE\n\nAL Rookie of the year favorite Aaron Judge came up with two outs and the bases loaded in the sixth after the Yankees had already scored twice to make it 3-2. With Joe Kelly pitching, Judge fouled off two 100 mph pitches with two strikes and laid off a 101 mph fastball to work the count full before grounding out to the shortstop.\n\nJudge had one hit in four at-bats while extending his strikeout streak to 35 consecutive games. He had already broken the record for position players, and now he's tied with pitcher Bill Stoneman (1971) for the longest in a single season.\n\nDREW'S DAY\n\nPomeranz was pulled from the game after throwing his second pitch to Headley in the fourth. After talking with manager John Farrell and the training staff, Brandon Workman was called in from the bullpen to relieve him.\n\nPomeranz, who had won six straight decisions, left with a 2-0 lead. He was charged with four hits and a walk, striking out four in 3 1/3 innings.\n\nTONY C.\n\nThe Red Sox unveiled a display in Fenway Park to honor former outfielder Tony Conigliaro, who was nearly killed when blinded when he was beaned by Jack Hamilton of the California Angels on Aug. 18, 1967. The display included Conigliaro's helmet, a jersey and AL championship ring from the '67 season.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka threw in the bullpen on Friday and is expected to come off the DL (right shoulder inflammation) to start in Detroit next week.\n\nRed Sox: LHP David Price hasn't been able to throw since Tuesday because of soreness. Manager John Farrell conceded time is running out for Price to get his strength back before the postseason.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: CC Sabathia (9-5) is trying to snap a personal two-game losing streak.\n\nRed Sox: Chris Sale (14-4) gets the start. He will be going for his fourth straight win.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But Chapman relieved with his team down in the eighth and he failed again -- Jackie Bradley Jr.'s two-run single making it 9-6.\n\nReed worked 1 2/3 hitless innings for the win and Craig Kimbrel struck out the side in the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nA two-run homer by rookie Rafael Devers (No. 7 in 19 games) and a solo shot by Christian Vazquez gave Boston a 3-0 lead, but Todd Frazier's two-run shot and a solo bomb by Sanchez (ninth in his last 21 games) tied the game at 3-3.\n\nVazquez had three hits and a walk while New York's Brett Gardner had three hits and a walk and Frazier two hits and two walks in the loss.\n\nPomeranz, 6-0 in his previous 11 starts and a 12-game winner, left runners in scoring position in the first three innings. After Benintendi made a diving catch of a Didi Gregorius line drive to start the fourth, Pomeranz fell behind Chase Headley 2-0.\n\nPomeranz, who was trying to beat the Yankees for a second straight time, could be seen stretching and then, after throwing a few warmup pitches, was removed from the game with the Red Sox leading 2-0.\n\nDevers, who tied last Sunday's game in New York with a ninth-inning homer off a Chapman 102.8-mph fastball, connected on a 2-1 pitch off Jordan Montgomery in the second.\n\nVazquez hit a 2-1 pitch leading off the fifth to make it 3-0.\n\nNOTES: LHP David Price didn't throw for a third straight day due to stiffness in his troublesome left elbow. ... Yankees RHP Masahiro Tanaka (shoulder) threw at Fenway Park on Friday and is expected to return next week in Detroit. ... Red Sox 2B Dustin Pedroia, on the disabled list with a sore left knee, will resume baseball activities next week in Boston with the team in Cleveland. ... RHP Rick Porcello will work the series finale against the Yankees with Doug Fister pushed back to Monday in Cleveland. ... LHP CC Sabathia, 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA in two starts Boston this season, comes off the disabled to pitch against Red Sox ace Chris Sale on Saturday night. Sabathia said Friday he thought about retirement when his right knee acted up Aug. 8. Sale has pitched well in all three games against New York this season but doesn't have a win. ...

The Red Sox bullpen held the Yankees scoreless through the final two innings to give them the 9-6 win in-game one of the three-game set.\n\nThe win now gives the Red Sox a five-game lead in the American League East over the Yankees.\n\nComing into the bottom of the seventh, the Red Sox trailed 6-3 to New York, and Boston's bats began to heat up at the right time.\n\nThe rally all started with a single from catcher Christian Vazquez who hit a solo home run in the fifth. Jackie Bradley Jr. then walked and Eduardo Nunez singled after him to load the bases up for Mookie Betts.\n\nBetts hit a deep fly ball to center field to drive in one run with Andrew Benintendi singling right after to cut the deficit to one run, 6-5. Next, Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases back up and it was Mitch Moreland who got the call to pinch-hit for Chris Young.\n\nMoreland delivered with the two-RBI single to center field.\n\nThe Red Sox did not stop after that, scoring another two runs in the eighth, and then a combination of Addison Reed in the eighth and Craig Kimbrel in the ninth prevented the Yankees scoreless for the rest of the game.\n\nEarlier in Friday's game, Red Sox starting pitcher Drew Pomeranz was pulled in the middle of the fourth inning due to back spasms. The left-hander finished his short outing with 65 total pitches while striking out four batters and allowing four hits.\n\nThe Red Sox early offense began with rookie third baseman Rafael Devers crushing a two-run home run over the Green Monster in the bottom of the second inning, making the score 2-0, Red Sox. The opposite way blast marked Devers' seventh home run in the 19 total games that he has appeared in.\n\nVazquez's home run in the fifth extended Boston's lead to 3-0. That hit marked his third home run of the year.\n\nThe Yankees made their move at the plate in the sixth and seventh innings starting with a two-run blast from the third baseman Todd Frazier. Gary Sanchez then followed up with a leadoff first pitch solo home run to begin the seventh inning, tying the game up at three.\n\nThe Yankees continued to produce offense in the seventh with Ronald Torreyes hitting a two-RBI single off the wall to give New York a 5-3 lead. Lastly, Yankees' center fielder Aaron Hicks drove it a run after getting hit by a pitch with the bases loaded.\n\nGame two between the Red Sox and the Yankees is set for Saturday, August 19 with the first pitch being thrown at 7:10 p.m.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T03:43:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2596, "textStart": 2587, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "03:43:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "303713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "score": 4}, {"id": "305016", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "305018", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "score": 4}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 3}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "305023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "score": 2}, {"id": "305786", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "score": 3}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 5}, {"id": "305794", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "305865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "score": 3}, {"id": "310467", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Craig Kimbrel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Kimbrel", "score": 2}, {"id": "310470", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Drew Pomeranz"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Pomeranz", "score": 2}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 4}, {"id": "310537", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "score": 2}, {"id": "310659", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "score": 4}, {"id": "310665", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Green Monster"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Monster", "score": 2}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 5}, {"id": "314176", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "score": 3}, {"id": "314218", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League East"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "score": 3}, {"id": "325673", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Single (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_(baseball)", "score": 4}, {"id": "325678", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "score": 2}, {"id": "327983", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox_minor_league_players#Mookie_Betts", "score": 3}, {"id": "334416", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Todd Frazier"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Frazier", "score": 2}, {"id": "407014", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hanley Ram\u00edrez"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanley_Ram\u00edrez", "score": 3}, {"id": "423231", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Addison Reed"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Reed", "score": 2}, {"id": "428880", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jackie Bradley, Jr."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Bradley,_Jr.", "score": 3}, {"id": "437478", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mitch Moreland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Moreland", "score": 4}], "image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/redsox_impact/photo/23260796-standard.jpg", "timeCrawl": "04:15:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Mitch Moreland go-ahead two-RBI single lifts Red Sox over Yankees;

New York had its four-game winning streak snapped.\n\nAddison Reed (1-1) got five outs, striking out three. He was the seventh Boston pitcher, after starter Drew Pomeranz left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth. Craig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 29th save.\n\nThe Red Sox opened a 3-0 lead on homers from Rafael Devers and Christian Vazquez. But Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer in the sixth, then New York scored four in the seventh to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nBoston loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh against Tommy Kahnle (2-4), scored one run on Mookie Betts' sacrifice fly and another on Andrew Benintendi's single. Hanley Ramirez walked to load the bases again before Moreland lined an 0-2 pitch to center to make it 7-6.\n\nJackie Bradley Jr. hit a two-run single in the eighth off Aroldis Chapman to make it 9-6.\n\nKahnle recorded just two outs, allowing two runs on three hits and a walk. Gary Sanchez and Frazier homered, and Brett Gardner and Chase Headley had three hits apiece for the Yankees. Aaron Hicks was hit by a pitch twice.\n\nDevers' homer was his fourth in five games and his seventh in his 19-game major league career.\n\nJudge\n\nAL Rookie of the Year favorite Aaron Judge came up with two outs and the bases loaded in the sixth after the Yankees had already scored twice to make it 3-2. With Joe Kelly pitching, Judge fouled off two 100 mph pitches with two strikes and laid off a 101 mph fastball to work the count full before grounding out to shortstop.\n\nJudge had one hit in four at-bats while extending his strikeout streak to 35 consecutive games. He had already broken the record for position players, and now he's tied with pitcher Bill Stoneman (1971) for the longest in a single season.\n\nDrew's day\n\nPomeranz was pulled from the game after throwing his second pitch to Headley in the fourth. After talking with manager John Farrell and the training staff, Brandon Workman was called in from the bullpen to relieve him.\n\nPomeranz, who had won six straight decisions, left with a 2-0 lead. He was charged with four hits and a walk, striking out four in 31/3 innings.\n\nTony Conigliaro\n\nThe Red Sox unveiled a display in Fenway Park to honor former outfielder Tony Conigliaro, who was nearly killed when he was beaned by Jack Hamilton of the California Angels on Aug. 18, 1967. The display included Conigliaro's helmet, a jersey and AL championship ring from the '67 season.\n\nTrainer's room\n\nYankees: RHP Masahiro Tanaka threw in the bullpen on Friday and is expected to come off the DL (right shoulder inflammation) to start in Detroit next week.\n\nRed Sox: LHP David Price hasn't been able to throw since Tuesday because of soreness.

The Sox blew an early 3-0 lead, fell behind by 6-3, then scored four in the last of the seventh and went on to beat the Yankees, 9-6.\n\nThe victory provided Boston with a two-game swing in the AL East title race. Instead of being three games up on New York in the division the Red Sox are five games ahead. Boston has won three in a row and is 14-3 in its last 17 games to pick up 5 1/2 games in the standings.\n\nRafael Devers had a two-run homer and Christian Vazquez was 3 for 3 with three runs scored and a solo home run. Mitch Moreland had the game's most critical hit, a pinch two-run single in the seventh to make it 7-6.\n\nBoston had to deal with an early change in its game plan when Drew Pomeranz suffered back spasms with one out in the top of the fourth and had to depart. He was relieved by Brandon Workman, who pitched well, but his immediate successors were not as competent.\n\nMatt Barnes, Joe Kelly, Heath Hembree and Robby Scott were all defective, not effective. However, Addison Reed rescued the bullpen with a great escape in the top of the seventh. He retired Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez with the bases loaded to end the inning after the Yankees had scored four runs.\n\nReed got the win, Craig Kimbrel the save.\n\nPomeranz was not dominant, but was effective before leaving the game. New York had baserunners in each of the first three innings but the lefty was able to strand them.\n\nThe Yankees started rookie southpaw Jordan Montgomery and he retired the first five Sox batters before Xander Bogaerts doubled in the second. Rafael Devers followed with a home run over the wall to put Boston ahead, 2-0. The Red Sox increased their lead to 3-0 in the bottom of the fifth when Vazquez homered to left.\n\nTodd Frazier hit a two-run homer off Barnes to cut Boston's lead to 3-2 in the sixth, then New York got four more in the seventh. Sanchez led off the inning with a game-tying solo home run.\n\nAll sort of messy things happened with the Boston bullpen.

He was charged with a blown save and would have had a loss had not the offense rescued him.\n\nIn the last of the seventh the Red Sox sent nine men to the plate. The inning began with Devers looping out to shortstop then Vazquez singled, Jackie Bradley Jr. walked and Eduardo Nunez reached on an infield hit to load the bases.\n\nMookie Betts drove in one run with a sacrifice fly, Andrew Benintendi drove in a run with a single to right and Hanley Ramirez walked to reload the bases.

The Sox blew an early 3-0 lead, fell behind by 6-3, then scored four in the last of the seventh and went on to beat the Yankees, 9-6.\n\nThe victory provided Boston with a two-game swing in the AL East title race. Instead of being three games up on New York in the AL East the Red Sox are five games ahead. Boston has won three in a row and is 14-3 in its last 17 games to pick up 5 1/2 games in the standings.\n\nRafael Devers had a two-run homer and Christian Vazquez was 3 for 3 with 3 runs scored, a stolen base and a solo home run. Mitch Moreland had the game's most critical hit, a pinch two-run single in the seventh to make it 7-6.\n\nBoston had to deal with an early change in its game plan when Drew Pomeranz suffered back spasms with one out in the top of the fourth and had to depart. He was relieved by Brandon Workman, who pitched well, but his immediate successors were not as competent.\n\n\"It really started to grab him in the first couple of pitches in the fourth,\" John Farrell said of Pomeranz, \"and we're not going to take any chances right there. He got treatment during the game and we'll see how he feels tomorrow.\"\n\nMatt Barnes, Joe Kelly, Heath Hembree and Robby Scott were all defective, not effective. However, Addison Reed rescued the bullpen with a great escape in the top of the seventh. He retired Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez with the bases loaded to end the inning after the Yankees had scored four runs.\n\nReed got the win, Craig Kimbrel the save.\n\nPomeranz was not dominant, but was effective before leaving the game.

(Moreland) really jump started us.\"\n\nThe Sox added two more runs off Aroldis Chapman in the ninth via a double steal by Devers and Vazquez that set up a two-run single by Bradley.", "dateTime":

But two have come in the last six days against the Red Sox, and they just might have cost the Yankees a chance at the AL East crown.\n\nThe most recent occurred Friday night when, after a stirring four-run rally in the top of the seventh gave the Yankees a three-run lead, the bullpen coughed it up in the bottom half.\n\nLatest Yankees stories Lennon: Wild-card spot may not be so bad for Yankees Back from DL, Sabathia faces Sale on Saturday Derek, Hannah Jeter welcome baby girl Rieber: Gary returns to 2016 San-chise mode Steven Matz chased early as Mets fall to Yanks\n\nThe Red Sox scored four times against Chad Green and Tommy Kahnle in the seventh and twice against Aroldis Chapman in the eighth, leading to a 9-6 loss in front of a sellout crowd of 36,784 at Fenway Park.\n\nThe loss dropped the Yankees (65-56) five games behind the Red Sox (70-51).\n\nThe Yankees trailed 3-0 entering the sixth, but Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer off Matt Barnes to make it 3-2.\n\nGary Sanchez hit a monstrous homer to left-center off Joe Kelly in the seventh to tie it at 3, sparking a four-run inning that gave the Yankees a 6-3 lead. The blast, Sanchez's 23rd, gave him six homers in his last 10 games. Ronald Torreyes singled home two runs and Aaron Hicks was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded to cap the inning, but Addison Reed struck out Aaron Judge and got Sanchez on a liner to first to strand three runners.\n\nThat proved costly.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nGreen, who came in ranked second among AL relievers with a 1.66 ERA, pitched a scoreless sixth but ran into trouble in the seventh. Christian Vazquez, who homered off Jordan Montgomery in the fifth to make it 3-0, singled with one out and Jackie Bradley Jr. walked.\n\nIn came Kahnle, who entered the game having allowed two earned runs in 14 appearances and struck out 15 in 11 2/3 innings since joining the Yankees.\n\nBut he was not on. He allowed an infield single to Eduardo Nu\u00f1ez to load the bases and a sacrifice fly to Mookie Betts. Andrew Benintendi's RBI single made it 6-5 and, after a walk to Hanley Ramirez, pinch hitter Mitch Moreland's two-run single on a 0-and-2 changeup made it 7-6. Green and Kahnle were charged with two runs each.\n\nIt got worse for the Yankees, as Chapman's shaken confidence took another hit. Though Joe Girardi said before the game that Chapman still was his closer, he called on the lefty in the eighth.\n\nChapman, who blew a save in last Sunday night's loss to the Red Sox at the Stadium, allowed a hit and a walk to start the inning and didn't even glance at the runners on a double steal. Bradley's two-run single made it 9-6.\n\nBoston lefthander Drew Pomeranz, who came in 12-4 with a 3.39 ERA, left the game with back spasms after 3 1/3 innings and the Yankees teed off on the Red Sox bullpen. Pomeranz allowed four hits and a walk, striking out four.\n\nMontgomery, 7-6 with a 3.94 ERA coming in, has been sharper, most recently last Sunday night against Boston at the Stadium, when he allowed one run and two hits in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nHe wasn't able to duplicate that Friday night, allowing three runs and four hits, including homers by Rafael Devers and Vazquez, in five innings.\n\nNotes & quotes: Playing in his third rehab game with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Greg Bird hit two home runs. His second, a scout in attendance said, was \"an absolute bomb\" to right. Bird could return at some point next week . . . Judge extended his big-league record by a position player when he struck out in the seventh, making it 35 straight games with a strikeout. He has 59 strikeouts in 123 at-bats in that span . . . Sanchez has five homers and 12 RBIs in his last seven games . . . The Yankees were 1-for-11 with runners in scoring position and left 14 on base. Judge and Sanchez each left seven on base . . . Chapman has walked 10 and allowed seven hits in 6 1/3 innings against the Red Sox this season. He has a 9.95 ERA and 2.68 WHIP against them in 2017.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T05:11:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri":

But Scott walked Gardner then hit the next batter, Aaron Hicks, to push a fourth run across the board, giving NY a 6-3 lead. He was the seventh Boston pitcher, after starter Drew Pomeranz left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth.\n\n\"There's been a number of wild-card teams that have either won it all or advanced very deep\", Red Sox manager John Farrell said before the game.\n\nThe righty wasn't much better, allowing a walk and a two-run single before recording a strikeout. The right-hander punched out Romine for the first out of the inning before being removed for the game. Though Frazier hit a two-run homer off Matt Barnes in the sixth, and Sanchez homered off Joe Kelly to tie the score leading off the seventh, the Yankees had only one other key hit: Torreyes's single off Heath Hembree, which rattled off the Green Monster in the seventh inning.\n\nThe 'pen gave a 3-2 lead away with an excruciating four-run seventh. He then ignored the baserunners, so they were able to pull off a double steal before Jackie Bradley, Jr. brought them both home on a single to center. Reed stayed on for the eighth and pitched a scoreless frame. Girardi went to the bullpen and brought in Kahnle, who couldn't salvage the inning.\n\nWith nobody warming up in the Yankees' bullpen, Hanley Ramirez worked a full-count walk and reloaded the bases for Moreland, a left-handed hitter who batted for designated hitter Chris Young.\n\nFor the third time in eight days, the Red Sox scored two earned runs off of Chapman.\n\n\"The Red Sox don't control the naming or renaming of streets but for me, personally, the street name has always been a consistent reminder that it is our job to ensure the Red Sox are not just multi-cultural, but stand for as numerous right things in our community as we can - particularly in our African-American community and in the Dominican community that has embraced us so fully\", Henry told the Herald. Chapman was asked to keep the Yankees within one run, but he gave up a leadoff single to Rafael Devers before walking Christian Vazquez.\n\nAnd that's what makes losses like this one so frustrating for Girardi and the Yankees.\n\nThe Red Sox and Yankees will play Game 2 of their three-game series Saturday night.

And the Yankees' offense showed a great deal of pluck, rallying from a three-run deficit with home runs by Todd Frazier and Gary Sanchez, whose seventh-inning blow was later followed by three more runs, two coming on a bases-loaded single off the Green Monster by Ronald Torreyes. But then the bullpen came unhinged.\n\nGreen, who pitched a hitless sixth, retired Rafael Devers on a soft fly ball and had two strikes on Christian Vazquez before the Red Sox catcher lined a single to left. After Green walked Jackie Bradley Jr. on four pitches, Girardi turned to Kahnle.\n\nKahnle, who proved to be the costliest for the Yankees to acquire in their seven-player deal with the Chicago White Sox, could not stem the Red Sox rally. Eduardo Nunez beat out a dribbler to the left of the mound, and Mookie Betts followed with a sacrifice fly to center that scored Vazquez and brought the Red Sox to within 6-4. Andrew Benintendi followed with a line single to right, scoring Bradley to narrow the Yankees' lead to 6-5.\n\nWith nobody warming up in the Yankees' bullpen, Hanley Ramirez worked a full-count walk and reloaded the bases for Moreland, a left-handed hitter who batted for designated hitter Chris Young. Moreland missed badly at two changeups from Kahnle, so the Yankees reliever threw him another.\n\nMoreland stayed back on that one and lined it back up the middle, scoring Nunez and Benintendi to give the Red Sox a 7-6 lead and bringing Fenway Park alive.\n\nAfter Addison Reed buzzed through the Yankees in the eighth, Chapman could not keep them close enough for another shot in the ninth.\n\nRafael Devers, who hit a 102.8-mile-per-hour fastball into the left-field bullpen off Chapman last weekend at Yankee Stadium, began the inning with a line single. Chapman then followed by walking Vazquez, after which the crowd began chanting Chapman's last name in singsong fashion.\n\nAs it did, Chapman did not pay attention to Devers, who took a huge walking lead and stole third without a throw. Vazquez followed his lead, taking second on the play. Bradley then stroked a single up the middle and both runners scored, while Chapman neglected to back up home plate and stood instead, stunned, in front of the mound. That drew Girardi, who had said before the game that Chapman would remain his closer, out of the dugout to bark at Chapman.\n\nLost in the bullpen's meltdown was the Yankees' continued poor hitting with runners in scoring position. Though Frazier hit a two-run homer off Matt Barnes in the sixth, and Sanchez homered off Joe Kelly to tie the score leading off the seventh, the Yankees had only one other key hit: Torreyes's single off Heath Hembree, which rattled off the Green Monster in the seventh inning. It was their only hit in 10 chances with runners in scoring position (though Aaron Hicks did managed to get hit by pitches twice).\n\nThe Yankees put a runner in scoring position in each of the first four innings but were unable to bring him home. And Aaron Judge, who singled and walked, came away empty from two at-bats with the bases loaded. He grounded out in a taut, eight-pitch at-bat against Kelly to end the sixth. And with a chance to break the game open, he struck out against Reed with one out in the eighth. It marked the 35th consecutive game in which Judge has struck out, equaling the major league record set by the former pitcher Bill Stoneman.\n\nIn making their comeback, the Yankees had taken advantage of an injury to the Red Sox left-hander Drew Pomeranz, who had beaten the Yankees three times this season. He was humming along with a 2-0 lead with one out in the fourth when his second pitch to Chase Headley sailed to the backstop.\n\nRed Sox Manager John Farrell and a trainer popped out of the dugout and joined a congregation of concerned players around Pomeranz. After a brief discussion, Pomeranz threw two warm-up pitches and Farrell turned toward the bullpen and raised his right arm high over his head: his signal for the tall guy, the 6-foot-5 reliever Brandon Workman. Pomeranz was later revealed to have had back spasms.\n\nBut by the end of the night, it was the Yankees who were hurting.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:34:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

And after sitting on the bench for the previous three hours, Mitch Moreland wasn't about to let it pass.\n\nThat was the preamble to the swing that might have won the AL East.\n\nLet's stop here and say that the Yankees have come too far and done too much in what was supposed to be a rebuilding season to be counted out after one tough-to-swallow series-opening defeat on a mid-August Friday night in Fenway Park.\n\nBut there was just something about this 9-6 Boston Red Sox comeback -- and Yankees squander -- that felt more damaging than all the others.\n\nMaybe it was that the Sox had rallied to beat the Yanks in 10 innings only five nights before in the Bronx. Or that Boston is making a habit of these late-game dramatics, winning for the 12th time when trailing after six innings. More likely, though, it was that Red Sox ace Chris Sale is scheduled to start Saturday night with the Yankees at risk of falling a season-high six games out of first place.\n\nRegardless, after Moreland banged a pinch single up the middle to drive in the tying and go-ahead runs, and the Red Sox tacked on two runs in the eighth against embattled Aroldis Chapman, and Addison Reed and Craig Kimbrel combined to record the final eight outs (six by strikeout), well, you could almost hear the air come out the Yankees' balloon.\n\n\"With them being the next-closest team, to get that win and kind of separate ourselves a little bit more and start the series off on the right note, yeah, it's a big one,\" Moreland said. \"Any time you can gain ground on somebody that's right there behind you, it's always nice.\"\n\nBut it's more than one game that has the AL East title trending in Boston's direction. Consider this:\n\n* The Red Sox won for the 13th time in 15 games; the Yankees are merely 15-10 in their last 25.\n\n* Once again, the Sox's offense resembled an assembly line, with nine batters coming to the plate in the decisive four-run seventh inning; the Yankees left 14 runners on base, with Aaron Judge stranding seven.\n\n* Five days after stomping off the mound at Yankee Stadium, Reed bailed the Red Sox's bullpen out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh inning, then threw a scoreless eighth; Chapman looked utterly lost again, the Yankees' closer giving up two runs in a non-save situation and bringing his total to seven runs allowed in his last four appearances.\n\nAdd it all up, and the Yankees might soon turn their attention to locking up a wild-card berth and not worrying about the Red Sox until the postseason.\n\n\"There's been a number of wild-card teams that have either won it all or advanced very deep,\" Red Sox manager John Farrell said before the game. \"I think there's a lot to be said for winning your division, though.\n\n\"But I can tell you right now: We still have, what, two months to go, eight weeks to go? Whatever it is. There's not been any conversation on what the end result of 2017 will be.\"\n\nIn other words, the Red Sox aren't counting any chickens. Not with lefty David Price sidelined indefinitely with an elbow injury and hardly assured of pitching again this season. And certainly not after Drew Pomeranz trudged from the mound with one out in the fourth inning Friday night, back spasms short-circuiting his start.\n\nBut when the Yankees are nine outs from a victory and unable to protect a 6-3 lead, when they let another game come off the schedule with only six head-to-head matchups remaining between the teams, when they're staring down the barrel of facing the AL Cy Young favorite who has dominated them throughout his career, it makes it easier for the Red Sox to relax -- or at least take a breath.\n\n\"We're trying to control what we can, and right now, they're the ones that are following us,\" Moreland said. \"So it's nice to gain some ground there.\"\n\nBy doing what they did Friday night, the Red Sox can accomplish something more this weekend.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T06:37:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "06:37:00", "lang":

The Sox blew an early 3-0 lead, fell behind by 6-3, then scored four in the last of the seventh and went on to beat the Yankees, 9-6.\n\nThe victory provided Boston with a two-game swing in the AL East title race. Instead of being three games up on New York in the AL East the Red Sox are five games ahead. Boston has won three in a row and is 14-3 in its last 17 games to pick up 5 1/2 games in the standings.\n\nRafael Devers had a two-run homer and Christian Vazquez was 3 for 3 with three runs scored, a stolen base and a solo home run. Mitch Moreland had the game's most critical hit, a pinch two-run single in the seventh to make it 7-6.\n\nBoston had to deal with an early change in its game plan when Drew Pomeranz suffered back spasms with one out in the top of the fourth and had to depart. He was relieved by Brandon Workman, who pitched well, but his immediate successors were not as competent.\n\n\"It really started to grab him in the first couple of pitches in the fourth,\" manager John Farrell said of Pomeranz, \"and we're not going to take any chances right there. He got treatment during the game and we'll see how he feels tomorrow.\"\n\nMatt Barnes, Joe Kelly, Heath Hembree and Robby Scott were all defective, not effective. However, Addison Reed rescued the bullpen with a great escape in the top of the seventh. He retired Aaron Judge and Gary Sanchez with the bases loaded to end the inning after the Yankees had scored four runs.\n\nReed got the win, Craig Kimbrel the save.\n\nPomeranz was not dominant, but was effective before leaving the game. New York had baserunners in each of the first three innings but the lefty was able to strand them.\n\nThe Yankees started rookie southpaw Jordan Montgomery and he retired the first five Sox batters before Xander Bogaerts doubled in the second. Rafael Devers followed with a home run over the wall to put Boston ahead, 2-0. The Red Sox increased their lead to 3-0 in the bottom of the fifth when Vazquez homered to left.\n\nTodd Frazier hit a two-run homer off Barnes to cut Boston's lead to 3-2 in the sixth, then New York got four more in the seventh. Sanchez led off the inning with a game-tying solo home run.\n\nAll sort of messy things happened with the Boston bullpen. Barnes was relieved by Joe Kelly and he delivered what has become a typical performance, allowing three earned runs. He was charged with a blown save and would have had a loss had not the offense rescued him.\n\nIn the last of the seventh the Red Sox sent nine men to the plate. The inning began with Devers looping out to shortstop then Vazquez singled, Jackie Bradley Jr. walked and Eduardo Nunez reached on an infield hit to load the bases.\n\nMookie Betts drove in one run with a sacrifice fly, Andrew Benintendi drove in a run with a single to right and Hanley Ramirez walked to reload the bases. Moreland, pinch hitting for Chris Young, put Boston ahead for good.\n\nThe inning lasted 65 minutes.\n\n\"A lot of things went the offensive way on both sides,\" Farrell said. \"We sent a number of pitchers to the mound and they put a number of balls in play. (Moreland) really jump started us.\"\n\nThe Sox added two more runs off Aroldis Chapman in the ninth via a double steal by Devers and Vazquez that set up a two-run single by Bradley.\n\n-- Bill Ballou

Their chances to make up significant ground were running out.\n\n\"We're going to see the Red Sox twice more and you always want to feel that you're in control of your destiny,\" Girardi said before the game. \"So these games are really important.\"\n\nAnd that's what makes losses like this one so frustrating for Girardi and the Yankees.\n\nThey had mounted a comeback, only to watch the bullpen give it away.\n\nAfter the Yankees scored four runs in the top of the seventh to take the lead, Chad Green and Tommy Kahnle combined to surrender four in the bottom of the inning as the Yanks went on to lose, 9-6, to the Red Sox before a sell-out crowd of 36,784.\n\nBoston kept building its lead in the eighth with two runs in the eighth against Aroldis Chapman, who continues to struggle.\n\nSo a win was within the Yankees' reach before their bullpen gave it away. The loss expanded the Yankees' deficit in the AL East to five games.\n\nThe Yanks trailed by three runs before they began mounting their comeback in the sixth against the Red Sox bullpen. Starter Drew Pomeranz had left in the fourth with an apparent leg injury.\n\nTodd Frazier, who had seven hits in his previous 30 at-bats coming into the night, hit a two-run homer over the Green Monster off Matt Barnes that made it a one-run game in the sixth.\n\nThe Yankees kept rallying in the seventh.\n\nGary Sanchez turned on a 99-mph fastball from Kelly and launched it over the Green Monster for a game-tying homer. Sanchez now has nine home runs in his last 21 games.\n\nDidi Gregorius then walked and Chase Headley singled. Heath Hembree then came in an walked Frazier to load the bases before Ronald Torreyes hit a two-run double to left to put the Yankees up, 5-3.\n\nRobby Scott then came in and walked Gardner and drilled Hicks on the left foot -- he had been hit on the right foot his previous at-bat -- to force in a run.\n\nFormer Met Addison Reed entered and struck out Judge and got Sanchez to line out to first to keep it a three-run game.\n\nBut not for long.\n\nIn his second inning of work, Green gave up a one-out single to Christian Vazquez in the bottom of the seventh and walked Jackie Bradley Jr. Girardi went to the bullpen and brought in Kahnle, who couldn't salvage the inning.\n\nAfter Eduardo Nunez reached on an infield single to load the bases, Mookie Betts hit a sacrifice fly to cut Boston's lead to 6-4. Andrew Benintendi then hit an RBI single and and Hanley Ramirez walked before Mitch Moreland's pinch-hit two-run single gave the Red Sox a 7-6 lead.\n\nSo almost as soon as the Yankees got the lead, their bullpen handed it right back.\n\nThe late eruption by the Yankees' offense had bailed out a subpar outing from Jordan Montgomery. The left-hander gave up three runs on four hits in five innings. He walked two and struck out three.\n\nMontgomery's night got off to a tough start as Boston jumped on him in the second.\n\nWith two outs, Xander Bogaerts doubled off the Green Monster. One batter later, rookie Rafael Devers drove a two-run homer just over the Monster to give Boston an early two-run lead.\n\nVazquez led off the fifth with a solo homer that cleared the Green Monster to give the Red Sox a 3-0 lead.\n\nEmail: iseman@northjersey.com\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:14:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7411764860153198,

The left-hander tossed 3 1/3 scoreless innings before being pulled from the game with back spasms. Boston's bullpen wasn't spectacular in relief of Pomeranz, but timely hitting bailed out the lackluster pitching.\n\nWith the win, the Red Sox improve to 70-51, while the Yankees fall to 65-56.\n\nThe Red Sox held a 3-2 lead entering the seventh inning, but a four-run frame gave the Yankees a late lead against their division foe. Boston would follow suit with a four-run outburst in the bottom half of the frame, though, and rode the momentum to a series-opening victory.\n\nIT WAS OVER WHEN...\n\nCraig Kimbrel notched his 29th save of the season with a 1-2-3 ninth inning.\n\nON THE BUMP\n\n-- Pomeranz was solid in his first three innings of work, scattering four hits while striking out four over that span. But as he warmed up for the fourth inning, the left-hander noticeably was favoring his back. Pomeranz recorded one out in the fourth before being removed from the game with back spasms.\n\n-- Brandon Workman allowed a walk and single upon relieving Pomeranz, but the right-hander notched the final two outs of the inning to get the Red Sox out of harm's way. Workman stayed on for the fifth and tossed a scoreless inning.\n\n-- Matt Barnes entered in the sixth and logged one out before Chase Headley lined a single to right field, followed by a two-run home run off the bat of Todd Frazier to trim Boston's lead to one. Barnes struck out Ronald Torreyes, but back-to-back singles from Austin Romine and Brett Gardner forced Barnes out of the game.\n\n-- Joe Kelly followed Barnes and plunked Aaron Hicks to load the bases, but the right-hander responded by getting Aaron Judge to ground out and end the inning. The seventh inning wouldn't be as kind to Kelly, though, as Gary Sanchez led off the frame with a solo blast to even the score 3-3. It would only get uglier for Kelly, as Sanchez's shot was followed by a walk and a single, which prompted Red Sox manager John Farrell to yank the right-hander from the contest.\n\n-- Heath Hembree followed Kelly and walked Frazier on his first batter faced to load the bases. Torreyes would then make Hembree pay, smashing a two-run double off the Monster to give New York a 5-3 edge. The right-hander punched out Romine for the first out of the inning before being removed for the game.\n\n-- Robby Scott came on after Hembree and promptly walked Gardner to load the bases. The left-hander then hit Hicks in the foot to push across the Yankees' sixth run, which forced Farrell to tap into his bullpen for the third time in the frame.\n\n-- Addison Reed struck out Judge and got Sanchez to line out to end the messy seventh inning. Reed stayed on for the eighth and pitched a scoreless frame.\n\n-- Kimbrel sat the Yankees down in order in the ninth to lock down the win.\n\nIN THE BATTER'S BOX\n\n-- Rafael Devers got Boston on the board with a two-run home run in the second inning, his seventh long ball of the season.\n\n-- Christian Vazquez, who went 3-for-3 on the night, knocked in Boston's third run with a mammoth solo shot in the fifth inning.\n\n-- The Red Sox's offense had been relatively quiet to start the night, but the bats finally came alive in the seventh. Vazquez kicked things off with a one-out single, followed by a Jackie Bradley Jr. walk. Eduardo Nunez then dribbled one down the third-base line to load the bases.\n\nMookie Betts plated Boston's fourth run of the game with a sacrifice fly, followed by an Andrew Benintendi RBI single to bring the Red Sox within one. After Hanley Ramirez walked to reload the bases, Mitch Moreland gave Boston the lead with a two-RBI single up the middle.\n\n-- The Red Sox's offense picked up right where they left off in the eighth. Devers led off the inning with a single, followed by a Vazquez walk.

Something about this particular game, though, just seems like it may wind up being more damaging to the Yankees' cause going forward.\n\nAfter Red Sox first baseman Mitch Moreland smacked a pinch single up the middle to drive in the tying and go-ahead runs in the seventh inning, the Red Sox tacked on two runs in the eighth to put themselves ahead by a score of 9-6. New York struggled to get the final eight outs of the game, going through three pitchers in the process. Aroldis Chapman, Addison Reed, and Craig Kimbrel were all needed to finally stop the Red Sox rally.\n\nThe Yankees offense struggled most of the night, leaving a total of fourteen runners on base, with superstar home-run machine Aaron Judge stranding seven.\n\nThe Yankees bullpen, which, since the All-star break, has led all of Baseball bullpen ERA(2.15), surrendered six runs in just two innings, costing the team the game Friday night. This defeat will need to be forgotten quickly as the same two teams square off again tonight.\n\nCertainly, this was supposed to be a rebuilding year for the Bronx bombers, however, considering how well they have played this season, this loss could have a devastating psychological effect on them moving forward. The Yankees currently trail Boston by only five games in the American League Eastern division and are still in prime position for a wild card spot. There is no doubt, though, that a young team getting its hopes up, coming that close to a division title and not obtaining it in a year where little was expected could have lingering negative effects on the mindset of the team even if it finds its way into the postseason. On the plus side, there is two months to go before the postseason even begins which means everything is still up in the air, and the Red Sox five-game lead is precarious. So, the Yankees should still take comfort in the fact that they have plenty of time to regroup, but this will be a tough one to get over.\n\nBoston, on the other hand, has been making a habit of these late-game dramatics, winning for the 12th time this year when trailing after six innings. Things don't get any easier for New York as Boston is scheduled to have their ace, Chris Sale on the mound tonight. There is no doubt that the Sox are enjoying the space they have put between themselves and their rivals and they look forward to doing more damage.\n\n\"With them being the next-closest team, to get that win and kind of separate ourselves a little bit more and start the series off on the right note, yeah, it's a big one,\" Moreland said. \"Any time you can gain ground on somebody that's right there behind you, it's always nice.\"\n\nThe Red Sox are currently in the midst of a hot streak, having won thirteen out of their last fifteen games. The Yankees, on the other hand, have posted a mediocre 15-10 record in their last twenty-five contests.\n\n\"There's been a number of wild-card teams that have either won it all or advanced very deep,\" Red Sox manager John Farrell said before the game. \"I think there's a lot to be said for winning your division, though.\"\n\nTime will tell if the division lead holds up for Boston, but when the Yankees are nine outs from a victory and unable to protect a 6-3 lead, its a telling sign, especially since the collapse came only five nights after they blew a lead at home to the same squad. When they miss another opportunity to stick it to the Red Sox and realize there is only six head-to-head matchups remaining between the teams, when they're staring down the barrel of facing the AL Cy Young favorite who has dominated them throughout his career, it makes it easier for the Red Sox to relax, at least for the time being.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T16:21:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "16:21:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "216987", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "218051", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "303711", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "score": 3}, {"id": "304992", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "score": 3}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 5}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 3}, {"id": "305865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "score": 4}, {"id": "310467", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Craig Kimbrel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Kimbrel", "score": 3}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 5}, {"id": "310511", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "score": 3}, {"id": "310552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "score": 5}, {"id": "310584", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Aroldis Chapman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroldis_Chapman", "score": 3}, {"id": "310591", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310669", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "312729", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale", "score": 2}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 5}, {"id": "334427", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Farrell (manager)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Farrell_(manager)", "score": 1}, {"id": "334448", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baserunning"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baserunning", "score": 3}, {"id": "423231", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Addison Reed"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Reed", "score": 3}, {"id": "437478", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mitch Moreland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Moreland", "score": 3}, {"id": "548622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball wild card"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_wild_card", "score": 3}], "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/RedSoxRally.jpg", "timeCrawl": "16:21:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Red Sox Rally Past Yankees  --  Again", "originalArticle": null}

Joe Kelly relieved with two outs and hit Aaron Hicks to load the bases.\n\nIn an electric matchup between Kelly's 100 mph fastballs and Aaron Judge's power, Judge fouled off four offerings and worked a full count before grounding out to shortstop.\n\nBut Gary Sanchez led off the seventh with a towering home run, and New York scored three more runs in the inning against Kelly, Heath Hembree and Robby Scott.\n\nAddison Reed (1-1) got the final two outs of the inning and pitched a scoreless eighth before Craig Kimbrel closed out the win in the ninth.\n\nIn the bottom of the seventh, Christian Vazquez singled with one out and Jackie Bradley Jr. walked to chase reliever Chad Green. Tommy Kahnle (1-1), one of the relievers obtained from the Chicago White Sox just before the trade deadline, allowed an infield hit by Eduardo Nunez on a dribbler toward third base. Mookie Betts drove in Vazquez with a sacrifice fly to center and Andrew Benintendi singled home Bradley.\n\nAfter Hanley Ramirez walked, Moreland pinch hit for Chris Young.

He got a third change-up and lined it to center field for a two-run single and a 7-6 lead.\n\nNOTES: Red Sox Manager John Farrell said David Price did not throw again Friday because of stiffness in his sore left elbow. His last threw on Tuesday after throwing three times on flat ground last week.\n\n\"He has to build up to an aggressive long-toss situation and build back to the mound. That's going to take some time. I don't have a return date at all,\" Farrell said.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

The left-hander looked strong over 3 1/3 scoreless innings of work, but back spasms in the fourth inning forced Pomeranz out of the ball game.\n\nBoston's bullpen has impressed throughout the season, but it certainly wasn't at its best in the series opener. Brandon Workman tossed 1 2/3 scoreless innings, but Matt Barnes, Joe Kelly and Heath Hembree struggled to get through the seventh, allowing four runs combined in the inning, giving the Yankees a late 6-3 lead.\n\nBut the Red Sox, as they've done all season, responded when it mattered most. In the bottom half of the seventh, Boston posted four runs of its own, capped off by a go-ahead, pinch-hit two-RBI single off the bat of Mitch Moreland. The Sox weren't done there, though, as Jackie Bradley's two-RBI single in the eighth gave Boston a three-run cushion en route to a 9-6 win.\n\nAfter the game, Moreland praised his teammates for battling in the late stages of the ballgame.\n\n\"It seems like it's been that way for us all year,\" Moreland said, as seen on NESN's Red Sox postgame coverage. \"We've got to continue to fight, and we've done a great job of it. Them putting up a four-spot in the top of the seventh and then us turning around and responding with our own four-spot in the bottom half is huge. Jackie tacks on the insurance runs in the next inning, and it was just a big win for us and a great way to start this series off.\"\n\nWith the win, the Red Sox extended their lead over the Yankees in the American League East standings to five games. With two more games at home against its division foe, Boston has a chance to separate itself from the rest of the pack.\n\n\"Obviously it's always nice to put some space between you and the next team,\" Moreland said. \"With them in here we've got an opportunity to do that and tonight was a big start at it.\"\n\nHere are some other notes from Red Sox-Yankees.\n\n-- Rafael Devers blasted a two-run shot in the second inning, his seventh home run in 19 games. The rookie is just the third player under the age of 21 in Red Sox history to homer in back-to-back games, joining Ted Williams and Babe Ruth.\n\n-- Friday marked Boston's 31st come-from-behind victory of the season, including each of its last three games against the Yankees.\n\n-- Since the start of 2014, Moreland leads Major League Baseball with a .459 average as a pinch hitter.\n\n-- Christian Vazquez went 3-3 with two singles and a home run. The Red Sox are 10-0 in Vazquez's 10 career games in which he collected three-plus hits.\n\n-- Craig Kimbrel struck out the side to pick up his 29th save of the season.

Put them in a situation like last night, having surrendered a three-run lead late in the game against their division rivals at Fenway Park, and the Red Sox look like a World Series contender.\n\nIt was the Sox over the New York Yankees by a score of 9-6 last night, and not a second before the 27th out was made did this game look over.\n\n\"That was pretty neat,\" said Jackie Bradley Jr., whose single off Aroldis Chapman in the eighth added two insurance runs. \"It was a great way to start the series and to finish this game. We showed a lot of resiliency being able to bounce back and nobody gave up.\"\n\nThe Red Sox took a 3-0 lead into the sixth inning and gave up two in the sixth and four in the seventh to fall behind with nine outs to go.\n\nBut Mitch Moreland hit a two-out, two-run single with the bases loaded to cap off a four-run seventh inning and lift the Red Sox into a 7-6 lead on their way to a 31st come-from-behind win of the season.\n\n\"I guess we're pretty good at it,\" Moreland said.\n\nThe Sox snapped New York's four-game win streak and expanded their American League East cushion to five games with 39 to play.\n\n\"To get that win and kind of separate ourselves a little bit more and start the series off on the right note, yeah, it's a big one,\" Moreland said.\n\nThe Sox bullpen, which entered the game first in the majors with a 2.94 ERA, has allowed 15 earned runs in its last seven games.\n\nAnd yet, the Red Sox have won 13 of their last 15, MLB's best record in that span.\n\nLast night's MVP could go to Moreland for his clutch hit -- his first in eight at-bats with two outs and bases loaded this season -- but Addison Reed deserves at least an ice cream for his work out of the 'pen.\n\nIn a disastrous top of the seventh, Reed was the fourth reliever of the frame. Reed, the set-up man acquired from the Mets at the deadline, was welcomed by Aaron Judge with the bases loaded and one out.\n\nReed struck out Judge on a cutter and induced a weak pop-up off the bat of Gary Sanchez, who had homered off Joe Kelly to start the inning, to end the seventh. It was the second time Judge had failed to convert with the bases loaded after Kelly got him to ground out to end the sixth.\n\nOn Reed's 30th pitch -- his second-highest total of the season -- he finished the eighth inning and let the Red Sox save closer Craig Kimbrel until the ninth, which he handled easily.\n\nIt was a long night for the bullpen, which took over in the fourth due to an early exit from Drew Pomeranz, who walked off the mound with the trainer for the third time since spring training started.\n\nPomeranz entered as one of baseball's hottest pitchers and was working on his fourth scoreless inning when he threw a curveball wide to the backstop and it became clear something wasn't right. He was seen pointing at his back during a mound visit and was replaced by Brandon Workman.\n\n\"My back just tightened up on my lower right side,\" Pomeranz said. \"It happens sometimes ... I should be fine in a couple of days, or tomorrow even.\"\n\nRookie third baseman Rafael Devers began the scoring with a two-run blast in the second inning. Yankees lefty Jordan Montgomery spotted a belt-high breaking ball on the outside corner and Devers ripped it to left-center for his seventh homer in 19 games.\n\nChristian Vazquez added a solo shot in the fifth.\n\n\"Once we turned into the month of August, the offense has turned it on,\" Farrell said. \"It's not any one guy.

Dellin Betances got the last three outs for his ninth save.\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and snapped Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry. He had allowed three runs or more only once over his previous six starts and had a 1.19 ERA in three starts against the Yankees.\n\nThe Yankees needed all four runs to preserve the win.\n\nThe score was 4-3 the eighth when Andrew Benintendi struck out, but advanced to first on a wild pitch by reliever David Robertson. Hanley Ramirez followed by lining a double to left field. The Yankees then intentionally walked Chris Young to load the bases.\n\nBut Robertson was able to settle down and struck out Xander Bogaerts on three straight knuckle curves.\n\nBoston got within a run an inning earlier when Rafael Devers got ahold of reliever Adam Warren's fastball, driving it just over the center-field boundary for a home run. It was confirmed after an umpire review. Devers' eighth homer was the latest highlight in the rookie's remarkable run since being called up to the majors July 24.\n\nTrainer's room\n\nYankees: Placed INF Garrett Cooper on the 10-day disabled list with left hamstring tendinitis and recalled Austin from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Todd Frazier took an 81 mph slider from Chris Sale off left shin in second inning. He briefly got attention from the training staff, but was able to stay in the game.

After the grab, Sabathia held it for a few seconds, walked off the mound and broke into a grin.\n\nLater, in the fourth, Jackie Bradley Jr. drifted back to the center-field warning track on Austin's towering drive.

The left-hander was one out away from his first 1-2-3 inning of his outing, but Todd Frazier golfed a fastball onto the Green Monster for a solo home run, extending the Yankees' lead to two.\n\nThe lefty was lifted after the seventh inning, having surrendered four runs on seven hits while striking out nine and walking one.\n\n-- Robby Scott came in with a runner on third and one out. He got Brett Gardner to hit a groundball to Rafael Devers, who quickly fired home to get the runner for the second out of the inning.\n\n-- Joe Kelly struck out Aaron Judge to end the ninth inning.\n\nIN THE BATTER'S BOX\n\n-- Sabathia had shut out the Red Sox this season, but Boston finally broke through in the fifth. Bogaerts got on base with a walk and Devers followed with a single to give the Sox runners at the corners with one out. Sandy Leon drove in Bogaerts with a groundout to second, and Jackie Bradley Jr. plated Devers with an RBI single to left to trim New York's lead to one.\n\n-- Devers continued his torrid pace in the seventh when he smoked an Adam Warren fastball into the bullpen seats for a solo home. The rookie phenom's eighth home run of the year cut New York's lead to one.

They're now five games behind the first-place Red Sox in the American League East. The Yankees started the day in first place in the Wild Card standings, 3 1/2 games ahead of the Angels.\n\nThe Yankees still have six games this season to play against Boston -- two this weekend and another four at home from Aug. 31 - Sept. 3.\n\nAnother loss this series could render that set meaningless for the Yankees, who were riding high, coming off a four-game sweep over the Mets in the 2017 Subway Series.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nHanded a 6-3 lead to start the seventh inning, the Yankees' bullpen collapsed.\n\nFour singles, two walks and a sacrifice fly had Boston ahead, 7-6, with the crowd chanting, \"Yankees suck!\" and reliever Tommy Kahnle struggling to collect himself on the mound.\n\nKahnle relieved Chad Green, who had worked a scoreless inning before getting an out and then giving up a single and then a walk.\n\nImmediately, ex-Yankee Eduardo Nunez hit a tapper back at Kahnle, which he couldn't handle, loading the bases. Mookie Betts' sacrifice fly then made it 6-4 and in the next at-bat, rookie Andrew Benintendi roped a single through the right side.\n\nThat brought in Jackie Bradley Jr. And after a Hanley Ramirez walk, lefty-swinging pinch hitter Mitch Moreland ripped a grounder up the middle for a two-RBI single, stealing the lead from the Yankees for good.\n\nThe half-inning prior to the relief letdown, the Yankees seemed to have put away the Red Sox.\n\nThe down 3-2, a four-run outburst highlighted by Gary Sanchez's monster solo shot to tie the game and a two-run single from Ronald Torreyes off the Green Monster that put the Yankees ahead, 5-3.\n\nWhen Aaron Hicks got hit for the second time in the game, it was with the bases loaded, and it brought home Frazier to increase the Yankees' lead to 6-3.\n\nThey had a chance to extend the lead, too. With one out, Aaron Judge came to the plate and struck out in full count. Then Sanchez lined out to first to end it.\n\nStarting pitcher Jordan Montgomery wasn't particularly sharp. The Yankees needed the left-hander who entered the game having given up just one earned run in three of his previous four starts.\n\nInstead, Montgomery had trouble limiting hard contact, at times trying to be too fine while also leaving pitches right over the plate.\n\nIn the second, rookie Rafael Devers made Montgomery pay, clubbing a two-run shot to left field to put Boston ahead, 2-0. It was a fat curveball in a 2-1 count with one out.\n\nThen in the fifth, Montgomery made another mistake. He got behind, 2-1, to the light-hitting Christian Vasquez. Then Montgomery threw him a 93-mph fastball that Vasquez tanked not just over the Green Monster, but out of the stadium to make it 3-0 Red Sox.\n\nNEXT\n\nYankees lefty CC Sabathia (9-5, 4.05 ERA)

He also improved to 3-0 in three starts against Boston this season. Dellin Betances got the last three outs for his ninth save.\n\nSponsored Content: Sign up for a free webinar as DoD, Air Force and VA offer insights on cybersecurity strategies.\n\n\"I felt confident coming in. But to be able to go out and pitch well against that team and get us a big win, feels really good,\" Sabathia said.\n\nHe said he's surprised himself by how fast he was able to return to action.\n\n\"I would have said, 'No way.' But everything's worked out,\" he said. \"I want to keep going out there and helping the team.\"\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and snapped Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry. He had allowed three runs or more only once over his previous six starts and had a 1.19 ERA in three starts against the Yankees. New York is 4-0 in games he has started.\n\nThe Yankees needed all four runs to preserve the win.\n\nGSA gives per diem travel rates another bump for 2018\n\nThe score was 4-3 the eighth when Andrew Benintendi struck out, but advanced to first on a wild pitch by reliever David Robertson. Hanley Ramirez followed by lining a double to left field. The Yankees then intentionally walked Chris Young to load the bases.\n\nBut Robertson was able to settle down and struck out Xander Bogaerts on three straight knuckle curves.\n\nBoston got within a run an inning earlier when Rafael Devers got ahold of reliever Adam Warren's fastball, driving it just over the center-field boundary for a home run. It was confirmed after an umpire review. Devers' eighth homer was the latest highlight in the rookie's remarkable run since being called up to the majors July 24.\n\n\"Even when we lose, we don't go down easy,\" Sale said. \"They throw some tough arms out there. We put some good at-bats together...We just couldn't squeeze it out.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: Placed INF Garrett Cooper on the 10-day disabled list with left hamstring tendinitis and recalled INF Tyler Austin from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Todd Frazier took an 81 mph slider from Chris Sale off left shin in second inning. He briefly got attention from the training staff, but was able to stay in the game.\n\nRed Sox: Manager John Farrell said LHP Drew Pomeranz, who left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth inning of Friday's win, was still experiencing some soreness on Saturday. But Farrell said that \"He's of the mindset he's going to be ready to go for his next start.\"\n\nDUBIOUS RECORD\n\nAaron Judge stuck out swinging in the fifth to set a major league-record with 36 consecutive games that he has struck out.\n\nRING 'EM UP\n\nSale now has 250 for the season, joining Randy Johnson and Pedro Mart\u00ednez as the only pitchers to record 250 or more in 25 or fewer games in a season.\n\nNICE PLAYS\n\nThere was a pair of standout plays on both sides Saturday.\n\nMookie Betts, the second batter Sabathia faced, sent a screaming liner back toward the box. The lefty snagged it by quickly raising his glove , with the ball sitting in the top edge of the webbing for a 'snow cone' catch. After the grab, Sabathia held it for a few seconds, walked off the mound and broke into a grin.\n\nLater, in the fourth, Jackie Bradley Jr. drifted back to the center-field warning track on Austin's towering drive. Bradley leaped with his arm outstretched and made the grab at the top of his full extension while his body went up against the wall.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: RHP Sonny Gray is 5-4 with a 1.88 ERA over his last nine starts. It is the majors' second-lowest ERA since June 25.\n\nRed Sox: RHP Rick Porcello has won each of his last three starts, but is 0-3 with a 3.79 ERA in three starts against the Yankees this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\n___\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:00:00Z",

Torreyes would then make Hembree pay, smashing a two-run double off the Monster to give NY a 5-3 edge. One batter later, rookie Rafael Devers drove a two-run homer just over the Monster to give Boston an early two-run lead.\n\nLAST START: Faced the Red Sox on Sunday in the Bronx, yielding just 1ER over 5.1IP (2H, 3BB, 4K) in a no-decision in the Yankees' 3-2 loss in 10 innings.was his second straight start allowing just 1R, while his 2H matched a career low.retired 13 of his rst 15 batters (had retired his nal 9BF in his previous start). was hit in the head by a yball during Red Sox batting practice the day before his start. The Red Sox held a 2-0 lead at the time of the pitcher's departure.\n\nThe Yankees put a runner in scoring position in each of the first four innings but were unable to bring him home. With Kelly pitching, Judge fouled off two 100 miles per hour pitches with two strikes and laid off a 101 miles per hour fastball to work the count full before grounding out to the shortstop.\n\nThe Yankees kept rallying in the seventh. He grounded out in a taut, eight-pitch at-bat against Kelly to end the sixth. \"But I wasn't able to get the job done\". After one warm-up toss, Farrell called for Brandon Workman to replace the starter. \"He's been getting treatment throughout the game, and we'll she where he is tomorrow\". He was charged with four hits and a walk, striking out four in 3 1/3 innings.\n\nFriday's game was constructed nearly exactly to fit the vision that General Manager Brian Cashman had when he acquired David Robertson and Kahnle from the White Sox to team with Chapman, the All-Star setup man Dellin Betances and the emerging Chad Green. The display included Conigliaro's helmet, a jersey and AL championship ring from the '67 season.\n\nSo a win was within the Yankees' reach before their bullpen gave it away.\n\nAt a time when it's reasonable to contemplate how the rest of the season would look without David Price, the Red Sox got a scare Friday night when lefty Drew Pomeranz was removed in the top of the fourth inning.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:02:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "04:02:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "216987", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "218051", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 2}, {"id": "305016", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "score": 4}, {"id": "305018", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "score": 4}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 3}, {"id": "305787", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "score": 2}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 3}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 5}, {"id": "310537", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "score": 2}, {"id": "310548", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "score": 2}, {"id": "310587", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dellin Betances"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dellin_Betances", "score": 1}, {"id": "310669", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "score": 1}, {"id": "311917", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "At bat"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "score": 2}, {"id": "312236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "score": 1}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 5}, {"id": "312734", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "score": 2}, {"id": "334427", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Farrell (manager)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Farrell_(manager)", "score": 4}, {"id": "334564", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brian Cashman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cashman", "score": 2}, {"id": "341843", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (W)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(W)", "score": 2}, {"id": "349554", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "score": 3}, {"id": "379867", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philip Humber's perfect game"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Humber's_perfect_game", "score": 3}, {"id": "398639", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Setup pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setup_pitcher", "score": 1}, {"id": "580419", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Brandon Workman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox_minor_league_players#Brandon_Workman", "score": 2}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "06:25:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Home", "originalArticle": null}

He also improved to 3-0 in three starts against Boston this season. Dellin Betances got the last three outs for his ninth save.\n\n\"I felt confident coming in. But to be able to go out and pitch well against that team and get us a big win, feels really good,\" Sabathia said.\n\nHe said he's surprised himself by how fast he was able to return to action.\n\n\"I would have said, 'No way.' But everything's worked out,\" he said. \"I want to keep going out there and helping the team.\"\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and snapped Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry. He had allowed three runs or more only once over his previous six starts and had a 1.19 ERA in three starts against the Yankees. New York is 4-0 in games he has started.\n\nThe Yankees needed all four runs to preserve the win.\n\nThe score was 4-3 the eighth when Andrew Benintendi struck out, but advanced to first on a wild pitch by reliever David Robertson. Hanley Ramirez followed by lining a double to left field. The Yankees then intentionally walked Chris Young to load the bases.\n\nBut Robertson was able to settle down and struck out Xander Bogaerts on three straight knuckle curves.\n\nBoston got within a run an inning earlier when Rafael Devers got ahold of reliever Adam Warren's fastball, driving it just over the center-field boundary for a home run. It was confirmed after an umpire review. Devers' eighth homer was the latest highlight in the rookie's remarkable run since being called up to the majors July 24.\n\n\"Even when we lose, we don't go down easy,\" Sale said. \"They throw some tough arms out there. We put some good at-bats together...We just couldn't squeeze it out.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: Placed INF Garrett Cooper on the 10-day disabled list with left hamstring tendinitis and recalled INF Tyler Austin from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Todd Frazier took an 81 mph slider from Chris Sale off left shin in second inning. He briefly got attention from the training staff, but was able to stay in the game.\n\nRed Sox: Manager John Farrell said LHP Drew Pomeranz, who left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth inning of Friday's win, was still experiencing some soreness on Saturday. But Farrell said that \"He's of the mindset he's going to be ready to go for his next start.\"\n\nDUBIOUS RECORD\n\nAaron Judge stuck out swinging in the fifth to set a major league-record with 36 consecutive games that he has struck out.\n\nRING 'EM UP\n\nSale now has 250 for the season, joining Randy Johnson and Pedro Mart\u00ednez as the only pitchers to record 250 or more in 25 or fewer games in a season.\n\nNICE PLAYS\n\nThere was a pair of standout plays on both sides Saturday.\n\nMookie Betts, the second batter Sabathia faced, sent a screaming liner back toward the box. The lefty snagged it by quickly raising his glove , with the ball sitting in the top edge of the webbing for a 'snow cone' catch. After the grab, Sabathia held it for a few seconds, walked off the mound and broke into a grin.\n\nLater, in the fourth, Jackie Bradley Jr. drifted back to the center-field warning track on Austin's towering drive. Bradley leaped with his arm outstretched and made the grab at the top of his full extension while his body went up against the wall.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: RHP Sonny Gray is 5-4 with a 1.88 ERA over his last nine starts. It is the majors' second-lowest ERA since June 25.\n\nRed Sox: RHP Rick Porcello has won each of his last three starts, but is 0-3 with a 3.79 ERA in three starts against the Yankees this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

He allowed two runs and four hits to earn his first victory since July 21. Dellin Betances got the last three outs for his ninth save.\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and snapped Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry. He had allowed three runs or more only once over his previous six starts and had a 1.19 ERA in three starts against the Yankees.\n\nThe Yankees needed all four runs to preserve the win.\n\nThe score was 4-3 the eighth when Andrew Benintendi struck out, but advanced to first on a wild pitch by reliever David Robertson. Hanley Ramirez followed by lining a double to left field. The Yankees then intentionally walked Chris Young to load the bases.\n\nBut Robertson was able to settle down and struck out Xander Bogaerts on three straight knuckle curves.\n\nBoston got within a run an inning earlier when Rafael Devers got ahold of reliever Adam Warren's fastball, driving it just over the center-field boundary for a home run. It was confirmed after an umpire review. Devers' eighth homer was the latest highlight in the rookie's remarkable run since being called up to the majors July 24.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: Placed INF Garrett Cooper on the 10-day disabled list with left hamstring tendinitis and recalled INF Tyler Austin from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Todd Frazier took an 81 mph slider from Chris Sale off left shin in second inning. He briefly got attention from the training staff, but was able to stay in the game. He then scored on Austin's homer.\n\nRed Sox: Manager John Farrell said LHP Drew Pomeranz, who left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth inning of Friday's win, was still experiencing some soreness on Saturday. But Farrell said that \"He's of the mindset he's going to be ready to go for his next start.\" For now Pomeranz is in a \"day-to-day situation,\" but the team is equally optimistic he won't miss his next scheduled appearance.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: RHP Sonny Gray is 5-4 with a 1.88 ERA over his last nine starts. It is the majors' second-lowest ERA since June 25.\n\nRed Sox: RHP Rick Porcello has won each of his last three starts, but is 0-3 with a 3.79 ERA in three starts against the Yankees this

Their bullpen blew a late three-run lead and, as part of the trickle-down from a three-run loss that dropped them five games behind the Red Sox, Aroldis Chapman lost his closer job.\n\nWith Boston ace Chris Sale on deck, Saturday night presented a recipe for ugliness. Instead, the Yankees came through with one of their more inspired efforts of the season.\n\nLatest Yankees stories Bird hitting well, could be back this week Lennon: Yanks make tough decision with Chapman Reed among former Mets suddenly with eyes on playoffs Aroldis Chapman no longer Yankees' closer Lennon: Wild-card spot may not be so bad for Yankees\n\nBehind six strong innings by fresh-off-the-disabled-list CC Sabathia, a three-run homer by Tyler Austin, a solo shot by Todd Frazier and a rickety but ultimately effective performance from a rejiggered bullpen, the Yankees edged the Red Sox, 4-3, in front of 37,274 at Fenway Park.\n\nThe Yankees (66-56) pulled within four games of the AL East-leading Red Sox (70-52).\n\nIn three previous starts against the Yankees this season, Sale had a 1.19 ERA and had struck out 35 in 22 2/3 innings. He struck out nine in seven innings but fell to 0-2 with two no-decisions against the Yankees this season.\n\nYankeesBird hitting well, could be back this week\n\nAaron Judge extended his strikeout streak to 36 consecutive games, giving him the major-league record for both position players and pitchers. He fanned three times, giving him 62 in 127 at-bats in that span.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nBefore the game, Joe Girardi demoted the struggling Chapman and said \"matchups\" would dictate his late-inning use of relievers.\n\nAfter Sabathia, who had been on the DL with right knee inflammation, allowed two runs and four hits in his six innings, Adam Warren and David Robertson served as a bridge to Dellin Betances. Warren allowed a solo homer by rookie Rafael Devers, the newest Yankee-killer, that made it 4-3 in the seventh. Robertson, who earned the nickname \"Houdini\" during his first go-round with the Yankees, struck out Xander Bogaerts swinging at a curveball to escape a bases-loaded jam in the eighth.\n\nBetances, who brought an 11-inning scoreless streak into the game, earned his ninth save, but it wasn't easy. It rarely is here. He struck out Devers and Sandy Leon, but on the latter strikeout, the curveball got away from Gary Sanchez for a wild pitch -- the second time a Boston batter reached first on a strikeout/wild pitch in two innings. But Sanchez gunned down pinch runner Brock Holt when he tried to steal second and Jackie Bradley Jr. flied to left to end it.\n\nSale entered the game 14-4 with a 2.51 ERA, including a 1.98 ERA in his previous 11 starts. For once, he wasn't sharp, and the Yankees made him pay.\n\nYankeesAroldis Chapman no longer Yankees' closer\n\nThe Yankees gave Sabathia a 3-0 lead in the second inning. Didi Gregorius (three hits) lined a first-pitch fastball to right with one out for a ground-rule double and Sale's next pitch, a slider, hit Frazier in the left shin area. Austin, elevated from Triple-A on Thursday when Garrett Cooper went to the DL with left hamstring tendinitis, then hammered a 95-mph 1-and-1 fastball onto Lansdowne Street for his second homer this season. As Austin made contact, Sale punched his glove.\n\nAustin nearly took Sale deep again in the fourth, blasting one to the garage door in dead center, where Bradley made a spectacular leaping catch against the wall.\n\nThe Red Sox scored twice in the fifth, an inning they entered with just one hit. Bogaerts walked with one out and reached third on Devers' single to right. Leon's groundout to second produced a run and Bradley lined a 1-and-2 fastball for an RBI single to left. Devers scored just ahead of Brett Gardner's throw to make it 3-2.\n\nFrazier gave the Yankees a 4-2 lead when he hit his second home run in as many days in the sixth. He drove a 1-and-2 pitch just over the Green Monster for his 21st homer.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:06:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details":

He allowed two runs and four hits to earn his first victory since July 21. Dellin Betances got the last three outs for his ninth save.\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and snapped Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry. He had allowed three runs or more only once over his previous six starts and had a 1.19 ERA in three starts against the Yankees.\n\nThe Yankees needed all four runs to preserve the win.\n\nThe score was 4-3 the eighth when Andrew Benintendi struck out, but advanced to first on a wild pitch by reliever David Robertson. Hanley Ramirez followed by lining a double to left field. The Yankees then intentionally walked Chris Young to load the bases.\n\nBut Robertson was able to settle down and struck out Xander Bogaerts on three straight knuckle curves.\n\nBoston got within a run an inning earlier when Rafael Devers got ahold of reliever Adam Warren's fastball, driving it just over the center-field boundary for a home run. It was confirmed after an umpire review. Devers' eighth homer was the latest highlight in the rookie's remarkable run since being called up to the majors July 24.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: Placed INF Garrett Cooper on the 10-day disabled list with left hamstring tendinitis and recalled INF Tyler Austin from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Todd Frazier took an 81 mph slider from Chris Sale off left shin in second inning. He briefly got attention from the training staff, but was able to stay in the game. He then scored on Austin's homer.\n\nRed Sox: Manager John Farrell said LHP Drew Pomeranz, who left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth inning of Friday's win, was still experiencing some soreness on Saturday. But Farrell said that \"He's of the mindset he's going to be ready to go for his next start.\" For now Pomeranz is in a \"day-to-day situation,\" but the team is equally optimistic he won't miss his next scheduled appearance.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: RHP Sonny Gray is 5-4 with a 1.88 ERA over his last nine starts. It is the majors' second-lowest ERA since June 25.\n\nRed Sox: RHP Rick Porcello has won each of his last three starts, but is 0-3 with a 3.79 ERA in three starts against the Yankees this season.",

But everything's worked out,\" he said. \"I want to keep going out there and helping the team.\"\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and snapped Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry. He had allowed three runs or more only once over his previous six starts and had a 1.19 ERA in three starts against the Yankees. New York is 4-0 in games he has started.\n\nThe Yankees needed all four runs to preserve the win.\n\nThe score was 4-3 the eighth when Andrew Benintendi struck out, but advanced to first on a wild pitch by reliever David Robertson. Hanley Ramirez followed by lining a double to left field. The Yankees then intentionally walked Chris Young to load the bases.\n\nBut Robertson was able to settle down and struck out Xander Bogaerts on three straight knuckle curves.\n\nBoston got within a run an inning earlier when Rafael Devers got ahold of reliever Adam Warren's fastball, driving it just over the center-field boundary for a home run. It was confirmed after an umpire review. Devers' eighth homer was the latest highlight in the rookie's remarkable run since being called up to the majors July 24.\n\n\"Even when we lose, we don't go down easy,\" Sale said. \"They throw some tough arms out there. We put some good at-bats together...We just couldn't squeeze it out.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: Placed INF Garrett Cooper on the 10-day disabled list with left hamstring tendinitis and recalled INF Tyler Austin from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Todd Frazier took an 81 mph slider from Chris Sale off left shin in second inning. He briefly got attention from the training staff, but was able to stay in the game.\n\nRed Sox: Manager John Farrell said LHP Drew Pomeranz, who left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth inning of Friday's win, was still experiencing some soreness on Saturday. But Farrell said that \"He's of the mindset he's going to be ready to go for his next start.\"\n\nDUBIOUS RECORD\n\nAaron Judge stuck out swinging in the fifth to set a major league-record with 36 consecutive games that he has struck out.\n\nRING 'EM UP\n\nSale now has 250 for the season, joining Randy Johnson and Pedro Mart\u00ednez as the only pitchers to record 250 or more in 25 or fewer games in a season.\n\nNICE PLAYS\n\nThere was a pair of standout plays on both sides Saturday.\n\nMookie Betts, the second batter Sabathia faced, sent a screaming liner back toward the box. The lefty snagged it by quickly raising his glove , with the ball sitting in the top edge of the webbing for a 'snow cone' catch. After the grab, Sabathia held it for a few seconds, walked off the mound and broke into a grin.\n\nLater, in the fourth, Jackie Bradley Jr. drifted back to the center-field warning track on Austin's towering drive. Bradley leaped with his arm outstretched and made the grab at the top of his full extension while his body went up against the wall.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: RHP Sonny Gray is 5-4 with a 1.88 ERA over his last nine starts. It is the majors' second-lowest ERA since June 25.\n\nRed Sox: RHP Rick Porcello has won each of his last three starts, but is 0-3 with a 3.79 ERA in three starts against the Yankees this season.\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nFollow Kyle Hightower on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/khightower", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:44:00Z", "extractedDates":

Chapman!\" as the $86 million man allowed Rafael Devers and Christian Vazquez to complete a double-steal in the eighth inning without even noticing before Jackie Bradley Jr.'s two-run single. In his last four appearances, the 29-year-old flamethrower has allowed seven runs.\n\nThe Yankees led the majors in bullpen ERA (2.15) in the second half heading into game, but their relievers combined to give up six runs in four innings on Friday night.\n\nExtremely reliable relievers Chad Green and Tommy Kahnle combined to give up four runs in the bottom of the seventh alone after the Yankees scored four runs in the top of the frame to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nMookie Betts started Boston's comeback with a sacrifice fly. Andrew Benintendi followed with an RBI single. And Mitch Moreland saw three consecutive changeups from Kahnle -- the final one a two-run single that put the Red Sox ahead 7-6.\n\nGary Sanchez had ignited New York's four-run inning with his 23rd homer. Ronald Torreyes aka \"Big Toe\" gave the Bombers a 5-3 lead in the frame with a key two-run single off the Green Monster. Aaron Hicks was hit by his second pitch of the night to make it 6-3 New York before Aaron Judge struck out with the bases loaded -- stranding three for the second time in as many frames. The teams combined to send 19 hitters to the plate and score eight runs in the seventh alone.\n\nRafael Devers (two-run shot) and Christian Vazquez homered off Jordan Montgomery to stake Boston to a 3-0 lead. Todd Frazier responded with a one-out, two-run homer in the sixth to bring the Bombers within 3-2.\n\nRed Sox starter Drew Pomeranz left the game due to back spasms with one out in the fourth. Switch-hitter Hicks was hit by pitches in both the left foot and the right foot.\n\nGreg Bird blasted a pair of homers in his third minor-league rehab game at Triple-A Scranton. Right ankle surgery has given Bird the ability to drive the ball, an ability he had lost while injured.\n\nPLAY OF THE GAME\n\nAndrew Benintendi went full extension to rob Didi Gregorius of a potential extra-base hit leading off the fourth inning. Clearly, Benintendi doesn't just do it with his bat. He had nine RBIs during Boston's recent three-game series in the Bronx.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nThe Red Sox' response to adversity after the Yankees took a three-run lead. It's remarkable how good Boston is at home against some of the best relievers in the game.\n\nPLAYER OF THE GAME\n\nRafael Devers went 2-for-4 with a homer, two RBIs and two runs scored. The 20-year-old rookie has been fantastic since his promotion to the big leagues.\n\nSTAT OF THE GAME\n\nAaron Judge tied pitcher Bill Stoneman (1971) with his 35th consecutive game with at least one strikeout in a single-season.\n\nUNSUNG HERO\n\nBrett Gardner had three hits, a walk and also played stellar defense in left field as he has all season. He had a terrific read to snare Hanley Ramirez's liner in the third.\n\nMIA\n\nThe Yankees went 1-for-11 with runners in scoring position and stranded 14.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSaturday at Boston, 7:10 p.m. CC Sabathia (9-5, 4.05 ERA) vs. Chris Sale (14-4, 2.51)\n\nTags: new york yankees boston red sox mlb Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "dateTime":

He allowed two runs and four hits to earn his first victory since July 21. Dellin Betances got the last three outs for his ninth save.\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and snapped Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry. He had allowed three runs or more only once over his previous six starts and had a 1.19 ERA in three starts against the Yankees.\n\nThe Yankees needed all four runs to preserve the win.\n\nThe score was 4-3 the eighth when Andrew Benintendi struck out, but advanced to first on a wild pitch by reliever David Robertson. Hanley Ramirez followed by lining a double to left field. The Yankees then intentionally walked Chris Young to load the bases.\n\nBut Robertson was able to settle down and struck out Xander Bogaerts on three straight knuckle curves.\n\nBoston got within a run an inning earlier when Rafael Devers got ahold of reliever Adam Warren's fastball, driving it just over the centre-field boundary for a home run. It was confirmed after an umpire review. Devers' eighth homer was the latest highlight in the rookie's remarkable run since being called up to the majors July 24.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: Placed INF Garrett Cooper on the 10-day disabled list with left hamstring tendinitis and recalled INF Tyler Austin from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Todd Frazier took an 81 mph slider from Chris Sale off left shin in second inning. He briefly got attention from the training staff, but was able to stay in the game. He then scored on Austin's homer.\n\nRed Sox: Manager John Farrell said LHP Drew Pomeranz, who left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth inning of Friday's win, was still experiencing some soreness on Saturday. But Farrell said that \"He's of the mindset he's going to be ready to go for his next start.\" For now Pomeranz is in a \"day-to-day situation,\" but the team is equally optimistic he won't miss his next scheduled appearance.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: RHP Sonny Gray is 5-4 with a 1.88 ERA over his last nine starts.

His fly to center plated Vazquez and cut the Yankees' lead to 6-4.\n\nAndrew Benintendi's ground single to right scored Bradley to make it a one-run game and Kahnle walked Hanley Ramirez to load the bases and earn a visit from pitching coach Larry Rothschild. At 0-2 to pinch-hitter Mitch Moreland, Kahnle gave up a ground single to center that drove in two runs and put the Red Sox ahead, 7-6.\n\nAroldis Chapman's recent troubles continued. In the eighth inning, pitching for the first time since Tuesday due to a balky hamstring, he gave up two runs on two hits and a walk. He also failed to back up home plate when Aaron Hicks' throw from center field got by catcher Austin Romine as two runs scored.\n\n\"[This game is] really important and we are going to see the Red Sox twice more and you always want to feel that you are in control of your own destiny,'' Girardi said before the latest killer loss to the Yankees' blood rivals. The Yankees and Red Sox have five games remaining against each other. \"So these games are really important.''\n\nWith the Yankees trailing, 3-0, after five innings, Todd Frazier hit a two-run homer off Matt Barnes in the sixth and Gary Sanchez opened the four-run seventh with a towering blast over the seats above the Green Monster off Joe Kelly. Ronald Torreyes added a two-run single and Hicks was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded to drive in a run. Hicks also was hit by a pitch in the sixth.\n\nIn the seventh, however, Aaron Judge made an out with the bases loaded for the second straight inning when he whiffed. Sanchez, hitting for the second time in the inning, followed with a soft liner to first baseman Hanley Ramirez to leave the bases loaded.\n\nSanchez opened the seventh with a homer over the seats above the Green Monster that tied the score, 3-3, against Kelly. It was Sanchez's 23rd homer, second in as many games and fourth in the past five.\n\nAfter the Yankees' stranded seven runners in the first five innings, Frazier pulled them to within a run via a two-run homer off Barnes in the sixth.\n\nChase Headley's second hit of the game, a single to right, came with one out. Two pitches later Frazier had his 20th homer of the season and fourth as a Yankee.\n\nConsecutive two-out singles by Austin Romine and Brett Gardner extended the inning and brought Hicks to the plate to face Kelly, who replaced Barnes.\n\nAt 0-2 Hicks was hit on the front foot to load the bases for Judge. He fouled off a 1-1 pitch clocked at 100-mph. Another triple digit fastball was fouled back. A slider in the dirt evened the count at 2-2 and another 100-mph fastball was fouled back. Kelly added one mph to the next pitch and missed wide. At 3-2 Kelly came with a 99-mph fastball that Judge hit on the ground to shortstop Xander Bogaerts to leave the bases juiced.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T03:51:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

During the satisfying stretch, the Red Sox have averaged 6.27 runs per game, the best in the AL.\n\nIf a team could get deflated, it likely would have happened to the Red Sox after the Yankees scored four in the top of the seventh on Friday to overturn what had once been a 3-0 deficit into a 6-3 lead.\n\nInstead, the Red Sox turned the tables right back on their rivals during an inning in which six players worked their way on base and a seventh came through with an important sacrifice fly.\n\n\"We have a lot of different ways to generate runs,\" said Red Sox manager John Farrell. \"I love the fact that there's quality at-bats up and down the lineup. We're going to take opportunities to advance 90 feet. It's just the tenacity of the group as a whole. Once we turned into the month of August, the offense has turned it on. It's not any one guy.\"\n\nIt's a lot of guys.\n\nChristian Vazquez started the big rally with a one-out, line-drive single to left-center against Chad Green for his third hit of the night. Jackie Bradley Jr. followed with a walk and the Yankees went to righty setup man Tommy Kahnle. An infield single by Eduardo Nunez loaded the bases and created the feeling that the Red Sox were again going to generate a memorable comeback.\n\n\"We have a lot of faith in one another,\" said Bradley. \"We feel like if one person doesn't get the job done, we feel like the next person will. And when you have that faith in each other, you can put together some great things.\"\n\nAfter Nunez came Mookie Betts, and many in the rowdy Fenway faithful were thinking grand slam. Betts instead lifted a sacrifice fly and it was a two-run game.\n\nUp came Andrew Benintendi, and he got a 1-1 changeup he liked and smashed it into right for an RBI single. Just like that, it was a one-run game. If the additions of Nunez and Rafael Devers have been keys to the August hot streak, the resurgence of Benintendi can't be overlooked. The rookie is hitting .392 in August with 14 runs, three doubles, five homers and 14 RBIs.\n\nThe baton was then passed to Hanley Ramirez, and the veteran battled his way to a seven-pitch walk.\n\nNow it was bases loaded and Mitch Moreland coming on as a pinch-hitter for Chris Young. Moreland swung and missed at two straight changeups. Perhaps he had Kahnle just where he wanted. The next pitch was also a changeup and Moreland smoked it into center for a two-run single. The Red Sox were back in front at 7-6, and added two more in the eighth on Bradley's two-run single against Aroldis Chapman, who has struggled all season in rivalry games.\n\n\"Executing. Execution is key,\" said Bradley. \"We're able to get timely hits. We've been able to battle back from deficits and I think we're just not quitting. We want to be tough outs, and when we put together great at-bats, we kind of feed off each other.\"\n\nIt has been a feeding frenzy of late, and the Yankees are the latest opponent to pay the price.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T07:02:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "07:02:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "303713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "score": 2}, {"id": "305018", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "score": 3}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 3}, {"id": "305786", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "score": 2}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 2}, {"id": "307683", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 5}, {"id": "310539", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "score": 2}, {"id": "310584", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Aroldis Chapman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroldis_Chapman", "score": 1}, {"id": "310668", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "score": 3}, {"id": "311917", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "At bat"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "score": 3}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 5}, {"id": "314176", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "score": 2}, {"id": "314218", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League East"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "score": 3}, {"id": "327983", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox_minor_league_players#Mookie_Betts", "score": 2}, {"id": "328427", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "334427", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Farrell (manager)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Farrell_(manager)", "score": 3}, {"id": "398639", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Setup pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setup_pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "407014", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hanley Ram\u00edrez"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanley_Ram\u00edrez", "score": 2}, {"id": "428880", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jackie Bradley, Jr."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Bradley,_Jr.", "score": 3}, {"id": "437478", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mitch Moreland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Moreland", "score": 2}, {"id": "484820", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tommy Kahnle"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Kahnle", "score": 3}, {"id": "1283126", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Andrew Benintendi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Benintendi", "score": 2}, {"id": "1297275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Christian V\u00e1zquez"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_V\u00e1zquez", "score": 3}], "image": "http://m.mlb.com/assets/images/9/9/2/249376992/cuts/1280x720/cut.jpg", "timeCrawl": "07:02:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Red Sox on a hot streak thanks to offense", "originalArticle": null}

He allowed two runs and four hits to earn his first victory since July 21. Dellin Betances got the last three outs for his ninth save.\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and snapped Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry. He had allowed three runs or more only once over his previous six starts and had a 1.19 ERA in three starts against the Yankees.\n\nThe Yankees needed all four runs to preserve the win.\n\nThe score was 4-3 the eighth when Andrew Benintendi struck out, but advanced to first on a wild pitch by reliever David Robertson. Hanley Ramirez followed by lining a double to left field. The Yankees then intentionally walked Chris Young to load the bases.\n\nBut Robertson was able to settle down and struck out Xander Bogaerts on three straight knuckle curves.\n\nBoston got within a run an inning earlier when Rafael Devers got ahold of reliever Adam Warren's fastball, driving it just over the center-field boundary for a home run. It was confirmed after an umpire review. Devers' eighth homer was the latest highlight in the rookie's remarkable run since being called up to the majors July 24.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: Placed INF Garrett Cooper on the 10-day disabled list with left hamstring tendinitis and recalled INF Tyler Austin from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Todd Frazier took an 81 mph slider from Chris Sale off left shin in second inning. He briefly got attention from the training staff, but was able to stay in the game. He then scored on Austin's homer.\n\nRed Sox: Manager John Farrell said LHP Drew Pomeranz, who left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth inning of Friday's win, was still experiencing some soreness on Saturday. But Farrell said that \"He's of the mindset he's going to be ready to go for his next start.\" For now Pomeranz is in a \"day-to-day situation,\" but the team is equally optimistic he won't miss his next scheduled appearance.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: RHP Sonny Gray is 5-4 with a 1.88 ERA over his last nine starts. It is the majors' second-lowest ERA since June 25.\n\nRed Sox: RHP Rick Porcello has won each of his last three starts, but is 0-3 with a 3.79 ERA in three starts against the Yankees this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:12:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 281, "textStart": 274, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-21",

He is 6-0 with five no-decisions in his last 11 starts and has won both August outings -- the second against the Yankees in the Bronx last Saturday.\n\nPomeranz, 9-1 with a 2.70 ERA since May 20, will face rookie Jordan Montgomery in the series opener.\n\n\"The one thing that Drew has done, he's kept us in a lot of ballgames because he's found a way to navigate when there's been men on base,\" Red Sox manager John Farrell said last Saturday.\n\nMontgomery, who pitched a strong game against Sale last Sunday -- one run, two hits in 5 1/3 innings -- comes into this start with his team four games behind Boston in the American League East after sweeping four games against the Mets.\n\n\"These are really important games for us because the clock is ticking in a sense,\" Yankee manager Joe Girardi said after Thursday night's game. \"The season is ... I'm not sure how many games we got, 40-something left, but they're really important.\"\n\nThe Red Sox led New York by 5 1/2 games when they left New York, and the lead would have been down to three games if the Red Sox hadn't rallied for three runs in the bottom of the ninth to complete their four-game season sweep (two this week) of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nNow, it's rivalry renewed.\n\n\"Let's win,\" Eduardo Nunez, who (along with rookie Rafael Devers) has invigorated the Boston offense since Nunez came over from the San Francisco Giants. \"They have a really good team and they have good hitting and good pitching, but we do, too. We'll see how it goes.\"\n\nThe teams play again in the Bronx from Aug. 31-Sept. 3.\n\nMontgomery, a young pitcher whose innings are being watched, is 7-6 with a 3.94 ERA but hasn't won since July 25. In his last two starts, he has worked 10 1/3 innings and allowed just five hits and two runs, walking three and striking out 11. He has a pair of no-decisions against the Red Sox.\n\nPomeranz has yet to figure out a way to keep Didi Gregorius or Gary Sanchez under control. Gregorius is 8-for-17 (.471) and Sanchez 6-for-13 (.462) with three homers against the lefty. Todd Frazier is 1-for-8.\n\nNo Red Sox hitter has more than six at-bats against Montgomery, and that is Wednesday night hero Mookie Betts 1-for-6 (.167). His two-out, two-run double in the ninth Wednesday gave the Red Sox their ninth walkoff win of the season, tied for the major league lead.\n\nThe Yankees, will bring CC Sabathia off the disabled list to pitch Saturday's game but won't have Luis Severino, who beat the Mets Thursday night.\n\nNew York has been resting the struggling Aroldis Chapman and had to use Dellin Betances to get the last three outs after a Curtis Granderson grand slam made it a 7-5 game in the ninth.

And the Yankees' offense showed a great deal of pluck, rallying from a three-run deficit with home runs by Todd Frazier and Gary Sanchez, whose seventh-inning blow was later followed by three more runs, two coming on a bases-loaded single off the Green Monster by Ronald Torreyes.\n\nAnd the Yankees' already slim chances of winning the AL East may be shot as well.\n\n\"Our guys fought really hard to get in front of the lead\".\n\nAnd that's what makes losses like this one so frustrating for Girardi and the Yankees. \"It's frustrating, but we'll be back\". Craig Kimbrel struck out the side in the 9th for his 29th save of the year. At 0-2 to pinch-hitter Mitch Moreland, Kahnle gave up a ground single to center that drove in two runs and put the Red Sox ahead, 7-6. Pomeranz finished his outing with four strikeouts, four hits allowed and 65 total pitches.\n\nBoston loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh against Tommy Kahnle (2-4), scored one run on Mookie Betts' sacrifice fly and another on Andrew Benintendi's single. Brett Gardner and Chase Headley added three hits apiece, while Aaron Judge and Austin Romine each contributed a base hit in the losing effort for the Yanks. Hicks also was hit by a pitch in the sixth. He walked two and struck out three.\n\nThe Yankees kept rallying in the seventh. He got ahead 3-1 before fouling one off, then Reed beat him with a 94 miles per hour fastball.\n\n\"I can't say it's not either\", Farrell said. He fouled off a 1-1 pitch clocked at 100-mph. He had already broken the record for position players, and now he's tied with pitcher Bill Stoneman (1971) for the longest in a single season.\n\nPomeranz, who had won six straight decisions, left with a 2-0 lead. The left-hander tossed 3 1/3 scoreless innings before being pulled from the game with back spasms.\n\nFriday's game was constructed nearly exactly to fit the vision that General Manager Brian Cashman had when he acquired David Robertson and Kahnle from the White Sox to team with Chapman, the All-Star setup man Dellin Betances and the emerging Chad Green.\n\nLost in the bullpen's meltdown was the Yankees' continued poor hitting with runners in scoring position.\n\nBoston has dealt with injuries to key starters all season long with David Price and Steven Wright now on the disabled list, and Eduardo Rodriguez having previously spent time on the DL as well. Manager John Farrell conceded time is running out for Price to get his strength back before the postseason.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:13:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6313725709915161,

This time, the battle between the two longtime rivals will take place at Fenway Park. The situation is nearly the same as it was last weekend; the Yankees are four games out of first place with a chance to alter the American League East race if they can steal a game or three from Boston, but a few things will have to go their way.\n\nThe most important thing is also the most obvious: The Yankees need to win. Last weekend at home, the Yankees stole a game on Friday night and had a game stolen from them on Sunday night. If they had held on to win Sunday's game, things would be a little different heading into this series. There would be a little more wiggle room and every game wouldn't be a must win. They just completed a four-game series sweep against the New York Mets but hardly gained ground because the Red Sox keep winning. The only way they'll gain on Boston is to beat them head to head.\n\nSecond, their starters need to keep them in games. On Friday night, that task is up to rookie Jordan Montgomery, who last pitched on Sunday night against Boston. He wasn't bad. He gave up one run on two hits with three walks and four strikeouts in 5.2 innings. CC Sabathia makes his return to the rotation on Saturday night and it will be no easy task because he's facing Chris Sale. On Sunday, Sonny Gray will start and is looking for his second win with the Yankees. He picked up his first Yankees win on Tuesday night in the Bronx as his team finally scored for him against the Mets.\n\nHere's another thing that needs to happen for the Yankees: Their hitters need to do better with runners in scoring position. They did it against the Mets, but the Mets aren't the Red Sox and the Mets don't have Sale on their staff. Even in their victory last Friday, the Yankees were 3-for-11 with runners in scoring position. They had that five-run eighth inning, but otherwise, they were pretty week. On Saturday, they didn't have as many RISP opportunities but they were 1-for-5. And on Sunday night against Sale and Boston's bullpen, they were 0-for-6.\n\n(Photo by Gerry Angus/Icon Sportswire)\n\nThe third thing that has to happen for the Yankees to be successful this weekend: Aroldis Chapman needs to pitch like a closer. He needs to shut the door. Of course, this all hinges (pun intended) on whether the Yankees enter the ninth inning with a lead, but if they do and go to their closer, he can't be walking batters and giving up hits. Chapman also has to mix his pitches better. He cannot have batters expecting his fastball and sitting on his slider. Catchers Gary Sanchez and Austin Romine will need to help out with this.\n\nSanchez needs to stay hot and Aaron Judge needs to snap out of a slump that's lasted for almost a month. When those two are on at the same time, the Yankees are in good shape -- though Sanchez has been a one-man wrecking crew this past week, hitting four home runs and batting over .400. Didi Gregorius and Aaron Hicks also have been hitting the ball well and if that continues this weekend, and the Yankees follow those three important steps, they have a good chance to sweep the Red Sox and get back in the race for the division lead.\n\nMore Coverage: How important is a healthy Masahiro Tanaka to New York?

He allowed two runs and four hits to earn his first victory since July 21. Dellin Betances got the last three outs for his ninth save.\n\nThe Yankees won for the fifth time in six games and snapped Boston's three game winning streak to pull within four games of the first-place Red Sox in the AL East.\n\nChris Sale (14-5) struck out nine, but was tagged for the four runs and seven hits. He is still looking for his first victory in the rivalry. He had allowed three runs or more only once over his previous six starts and had a 1.19 ERA in three starts against the Yankees.\n\nThe Yankees needed all four runs to preserve the win.\n\nThe score was 4-3 the eighth when Andrew Benintendi struck out, but advanced to first on a wild pitch by reliever David Robertson. Hanley Ramirez followed by lining a double to left field. The Yankees then intentionally walked Chris Young to load the bases.\n\nBut Robertson was able to settle down and struck out Xander Bogaerts on three straight knuckle curves.\n\nBoston got within a run an inning earlier when Rafael Devers got ahold of reliever Adam Warren's fastball, driving it just over the center-field boundary for a home run. It was confirmed after an umpire review. Devers' eighth homer was the latest highlight in the rookie's remarkable run since being called up to the majors July 24.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: Placed INF Garrett Cooper on the 10-day disabled list with left hamstring tendinitis and recalled INF Tyler Austin from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Todd Frazier took an 81 mph slider from Chris Sale off left shin in second inning. He briefly got attention from the training staff, but was able to stay in the game. He then scored on Austin's homer.\n\nRed Sox: Manager John Farrell said LHP Drew Pomeranz, who left mid-batter with back spasms in the fourth inning of Friday's win, was still experiencing some soreness on Saturday. But Farrell said that \"He's of the mindset he's going to be ready to go for his next start.\" For now Pomeranz is in a \"day-to-day situation,\" but the team is equally optimistic he won't miss his next scheduled appearance.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: RHP Sonny Gray is 5-4 with a 1.88 ERA over his last nine starts. It is the majors' second-lowest ERA since June 25.\n\nRed Sox: RHP Rick Porcello has won each of his last three starts, but is 0-3 with a 3.79 ERA in three starts against the Yankees this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Not after the Yankees had a 6-3 lead in the seventh inning, thanks to a stirring comeback that had silenced the fans at Fenway Park.\n\nAt that point it was a must-win when you're chasing. Yet the Yankees couldn't even get to Chapman, as the combination of Chad Green and Tommy Kahnle gave up four runs in the bottom of the seventh.\n\nSo it was 7-6 and when Girardi used Chapman anyway, the Red Sox jumped him for two runs, getting good swings as if he was throwing 90, not 100. Furthermore, they embarrassed him by pulling off a double-steal when the lefthander didn't bother to so much as look back at the runner at second.\n\nThat was enough to tell Chapman was lost in his own search for answers, as he tries to figure out what's happened to him.\n\nIn any case, the add-on runs made for a 9-6 final, as the Sox late-inning combination of Addison Reed and Craig Kimbrel was practically flawless.\n\nReed, the ex-Met, got the biggest outs, bailing the Sox out of a bases-loaded situation in the seventh by striking out Aaron Judge with high heat and fooling Gary Sanchez into weak contact with an off-speed slider.\n\nAdd it all up and, man, the Yankees had some crushing losses against these Red Sox lately. You have to wonder how many they can withstand before it dooms them once and for all to second place in the AL East and the wild card path to October.\n\nThe deficit is five games now, and it looms larger because Chris Sale takes the mound again against the Yankees on Saturday.\n\nThey continue to find ways to hang in there, but for how much longer?\n\nYes, Sanchez is hot with the bat, but Judge can't escape his slump even after hitting a couple home runs in the Subway Series.\n\nI thought he was turning a corner of late, but that discipline he showed in the first half comes and goes now, and he just can't seem to stay off the high fastball anymore.\n\nMore than anyone, he had a chance to turn the game into a rout for the Yankees during their comeback, but twice came up empty with the bases loaded.\n\nHe actually had a heck of an at-bat against Joe Kelly's 100-mph fastball in the sixth, fouling off a few two-strike pitching before grounding out hard to short, and he battled Reed to a full count as well in the seventh.\n\nBut with only one out in that spot, just a fly ball would have upped the Yankees' lead to 7-3, with Sanchez coming up, and who knows if things go differently from there.\n\nAfterward Judge shook his head and said, \"Those are the at-bats you want to be in. I felt like my process was good but (Reed) made a good pitch on me and I couldn't get to it.\"\n\nKiller loss, all right.\n\nBut it was quite a game, quite a playoff atmosphere at Fenway.\n\nHard for Yankee fans to look at it that way, I know, but it's great to see the spark back in this rivalry. And it's all about the young stars on both sides that is setting up what could be another golden age of this famed rivalry.\n\n\"Oh, yeah, you can see the way it's going to be here for at least the next few years,'' Brett Gardner said. \"People say the rivalry was stronger five or 10 years ago, or whatever, but there's so much young talent on both sides, it's a lot of fun.\"\n\nIt's not fun to lose games like this, of course, but both of these teams are almost surely headed for the postseason and, who knows, maybe their first October meeting since The Rivalry peaked in 2003 and '04 with those ultra-intense ALCS matchups.\n\nMore and more it's looking like the Yankees will have to take the wild card route to get there, and, at this point, Girardi & Co. would be just fine with that -- if you could just guarantee them Chapman's funk will be ancient history by then\n\nTags: new york yankees boston red sox mlb Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet",

Maybe it will be Clint Frazier coming off the disabled list from that oblique injury to do damage again with those lightning-quick hands.\n\nYankees will turn to Aroldis Chapman on Friday, if needed\n\nCertainly if Gleyber Torres hadn't needed elbow surgery after that doomed slide at the plate a month ago, he'd be here by now, probably playing third base rather than Todd Frazier.\n\nThe point is that the young talent keeps coming on both sides, setting up what could be another golden age this famed rivalry.\n\n\"Oh, yeah, you can see the way it's going to be here for at least the next few years,'' Brett Gardner was saying before Friday night's game. \"People say the rivalry was stronger five or 10 years ago, or whatever, but there's so much young talent on both sides, it's a lot of fun.\n\n\"Maybe you don't have the bad blood they had years back, when I was watching them in college and you could see that intensity, but all of the young talent makes this really exciting. You can see that both organizations are set up to compete well into the future.\"\n\nYankees series in Boston is one of last chances to catch Red Sox\n\nYes, you have to think the Yankees and the Red Sox are headed at some point for their first post-season showdown since The Rivalry peaked in 2003 and '04 with those ultra-intense ALCS matchups.\n\nWho knows, maybe it will happen this season, since it seems likely that both teams are headed for October baseball. Each probably would have to get to the ALCS, though it's not out of the question the Red Sox could overtake the Astros for best record in the AL, potentially setting up a meeting with the Yankees in the division series.\n\nAfter all, the 'Stros have gone cold lately, but with all of their young, position-player talent, they too figure to be a force for years to come. The Yankees and Red Sox, however, have to be more concerned about trying to out-do each other.\n\nOnly a year ago it seemed the Sox were destined to dominate the Yankees for a few years, thanks to the emergence of home-grown kids like Mookie Betts, Xander Bogaerts and Jackie Bradley Jr., and then the late-season call-up of Benintendi.\n\nDerek Jeter baby news leads to outpouring of well wishes\n\nThrow in Devers and the Sox have four keepers at age 24 or younger.\n\nWho knew, however, the Yankees would close that young talent gap faster and more significantly than anyone imagined.\n\nHow's this for a roster of under-25 players with star potential: Aaron Judge (25), Gary Sanchez (24), Bird (24), Luis Severino (23), Frazier (22), Torres (20).\n\nThe most obvious difference is the presence of Severino for the Yankees, giving them an ace-like pitcher at such a young age, which is the one thing the Red Sox don't have at the big-league level or seemingly in the high minors.\n\nYankees Twitter account trolls Mets with 'Game of Thrones' quote\n\nBut the Sox do have Chris Sale, who is only 28, under contract for two more years, and figures to have as much say as anyone in which of these teams has more success.\n\nHe too is a reflection of the staggering amount of talent the Red Sox had collected in their farm system, traded as he was from the White Sox for Yoan Moncada, the No. 1 prospect in all of the minors last year, and Michael Kopech, a 20-year old pitcher who throws 100-mph-plus and has Severino-like potential.\n\nThe Yankees, of course, passed on the Sale sweepstakes last winter, mainly because Brian Cashman didn't foresee success so soon after committing to something of a rebuild.\n\nIn Sonny Gray they did get a No. 2-type starter who is only 27 and, depending on David Price and his ongoing elbow issues, together with Severino gives the Yankees the better 1-2 punch at the top of the rotation.\n\nSeverino, Sanchez dominate as Yankees win 7-5 to sweep Mets\n\nOr does Sale negate any such advantage?\n\nThen there are the bullpens: the Red Sox have Craig Kimbrel but Yankees appear to be significantly deeper, so there are a lot of ways to try and size up these teams moving forward.\n\nThe only certainty is that it should bring The Rivalry to a boil for the first time in years, which, as Gardner said, makes for a lot of fun. Of course, a little bad blood along the way wouldn't be such a bad thing either.\n\nTags: new york yankees boston red sox mlb Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet",

And earlier in the day, manager Joe Girardi stripped the struggling Aroldis Chapman of his closer's duties.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, CC Sabathia, Tyler Austin and Todd Frazier didn't let the deficit grow to a half-dozen with a 4-3 victory witnessed by 37,274 and pulled the Yankees to within four lengths of first place.\n\nThe victory gives the Yankees a chance to take two of three when they send Sonny Gray to the mound Sunday. He will be opposed by Rick Porcello, a 14-game loser who has won his past three starts.\n\nIn his first start since Aug. 8, when he suffered a painful right knee and was placed on the DL the following day, Sabathia allowed two runs and four hits in six innings. He is 10-5 overall and 3-0 against the Red Sox this season.\n\nAustin crushed a three-run homer in the second inning. It was his first career at-bat against Sale. Frazier homered for a second straight game in the sixth and made a run-saving diving catch in the sixth.\n\nAdam Warren replaced Sabathia to start the seventh with a 4-2 lead and gave up a one-out solo homer to Rafael Devers. It was Devers' eighth big league homer in 86 at-bats. Warren struck out Sandy Leon and was replaced by David Robertson, who needed one pitch to retire Jackie Bradley, Jr. and keep the Yankees ahead 4-3.\n\nThe Red Sox loaded the bases in the eighth against Robertson on a wild pitch/strike three to Andrew Benintendi, a double by Hanley Ramirez and an intentional walk to pinch hitter Mitch Moreland. Robertson then fed Xander Bogaerts three straight curveballs and struck him out to strand three.\n\nDellin Betances recorded the final three outs for his ninth save as Chapman never got near the mound. He needed Gary Sanchez to throw out Brock Holt attempting to swipe second after reaching first when another strike three in the dirt got by Sanchez.\n\nSale's fourth start against the Yankees this season easily was his worst. In seven innings, the lock for the AL Cy Young allowed four runs, seven hits (two homers), a walk, hit a batter and fanned nine. He is 0-2 with a 2.12 ERA in his four starts against the Yankees. Overall, Sale is 14-5.\n\nAaron Judge's strikeout in the fifth inning set the major league record of games with at least one whiff at 36. He finished 0-for-4 and fanned three times, including to end the ninth with two on and the Yankees leading 4-3.\n\nMookie Betts opened the sixth with a double to center and Girardi allowed Sabathia to face the left-handed-hitting Benintendi with the Yankees ahead 4-2.\n\nBenintendi popped to short left for the first out before Hanley Ramirez's line drive was snagged out of the air by third baseman Frazier. Sabathia stranded Betts on second when Chris Young fouled out to first baseman Chase Headley.\n\nFrazier's second homer in as many nights upped the Yankees' lead to 4-2 in the sixth inning. Sale retired the first two hitters before Frazier lofted a fly ball that barely got over the Green Monster. It was Frazier's 21st overall homer of the season and fifth as a Yankee.\n\nSabathia faced his first jam in the fifth when the Red Sox put runners at the corners with one out and had Sandy Leon at the plate trailing 3-0. Leon's ground out to the right side scored Xander Bogaerts from third and moved Devers to second. Ninth-place hitter Jackie Bradley Jr.'s single to left plated Devers and sliced the Yankees' lead to 3-2.\n\nSabathia kept it a one-run game by getting Eduardo Nunez on a grounder to Frazier.\n\nThrough five frames, Sabathia allowed two runs and three hits and showed no signs the right knee that forced him to the DL was bothering him.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:42:00Z",

Can the Yankees take this one and inch closer to the top of the division?\n\nThe Red Sox have won eight out of their last ten, and currently hold a four game division lead in the AL East. In this ten game span, their lineup has average 5.5 runs per game while their pitching has held opponents to just 3.3 runs per game. They face the Yankees in Boston this weekend with just about the same size lead as they did last weekend when they took two out of three.\n\nThe Yankees are coming hot off of a four-game sweep of the Mets in this season's only Subway Series. There were a few close games against the crosstown rivals due to some shaky bullpen efforts by the Yankees, but their starters looked strong and their lineup showed some life. This is a must-win series for New York if they hope to overtake Boston in the AL East.\n\nMontgomery was called up by the Yankees to be a back end starter for the 2017 season and he's performed admirably in the role thus far. He comes into Friday night's game with a 3.94 ERA and 1.22 WHIP along with an 8.55 K/9. After a rocky July in which he won only a single game, he appears to be bouncing back in August, sporting a 1.74 ERA in two starts. He's pitched in a couple games against Boston this season, going 0-0 while allowing 4 runs in 9.1 innings.\n\nAfter a rocky start to the season, Pomeranz has been rock solid for the Red Sox in a rotation that becomes fairly questionable after ace Chris Sale. In the months of June and July he posted an ERA of 3.00 or under, and he has started off August equally well. Overall this year the lefty has a 3.39 ERA and a 1.34 WHIP. In three starts against the Yankees he's gone 3-0 and combined for 17.2 IP while allowing eight runs and striking out 19.\n\nAugust is Gary Sanchez's month, and no one can tell him otherwise. The Yankees catcher has six home runs in 15 games, including four in his last seven. He's also batting .333 and slugging .745 in the month. The bat of Didi Gregorius is picking up as well. He's hitting .359 in his last 16 games with 34 total bases, which is good for second on the team over that span.\n\nSince coming back from his injury, Aaron Hicks has been slow to get things started. He's hitting .182 in eight games in August, although two of his six hits have been home runs. In the past week, Aaron Judge has hit .200 and struck out 13 times, including a three strikeout game last night against the Mets.\n\nBoston Rookies Rafael Devers and Andrew Benintendi continue their hot streaks as they roll into Friday night. In the month of August, both players have an OPS over 1.000, and the two have combined for nine home runs and 22 RBI in their last twelve games.\n\nJackie Bradley Jr. seems to be struggling a bit at the plate, having gathered only eight hits in his last 43 at bats while striking out 16 times. Chris Young is having difficulties as well, only reaching base five times in his past eight games. Eduardo Nunez has gone six consecutive games without an extra base hit.\n\nThe red hot Red Sox hitters are going to give Montgomery a run for his money tonight. He hasn't faired especially well against them in the past, so it will be up to the Yankees bullpen to really perform if they expect to win. The Yankees are coming off a four game sweep, but none of the victories were especially decisive, and so they don't have nearly as much momentum as Boston.\n\nTonight's game will be broadcast on YES, NESN, and MLB Network, and streaming on MLB.TV for out of market subscribers.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T15:58:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "15:58:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 4}, {"id": "303713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "score": 2}, {"id": "304992", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "score": 5}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "305786", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "score": 4}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 3}, {"id": "305794", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "score": 2}, {"id": "305865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "score": 3}, {"id": "310465", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "score": 2}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 4}, {"id": "310537", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "score": 3}, {"id": "310550", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strikeouts per 9 innings pitched"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeouts_per_9_innings_pitched", "score": 3}, {"id": "310664", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Closer (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)", "score": 4}, {"id": "311917", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "At bat"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "score": 2}, {"id": "312729", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale", "score": 3}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 5}, {"id": "312737", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "score": 4}, {"id": "312740", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "score": 3}, {"id": "314181", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "score": 3}, {"id": "314218", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League East"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "score": 4}, {"id": "334415", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "score": 2}, {"id": "340439", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "score": 1}, {"id": "341692", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Extra base hit"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_base_hit", "score": 1}, {"id": "397265", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Didi Gregorius"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didi_Gregorius", "score": 2}, {"id": "423232", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Aaron Hicks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hicks", "score": 2}, {"id": "428880", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jackie Bradley, Jr."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Bradley,_Jr.", "score": 2}], "image": "https://realsport101.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/28e391e2c94d4d6ea9a415f1e6847448.jpg", "timeCrawl": "21:37:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "New York Yankees vs Boston Red Sox Lineups, preview and predictions - RealSport", "originalArticle": null}

Boston's victories have generally been in dramatic fashion, and the Sox already have nine walk-off wins in 2017, six more than they had all of last year when they captured the American League East championship.\n\n\"It's playing hard, and playing hard for nine innings no matter the score is,\" said Mookie Betts of Boston's penchant for late-game heroics.\n\nThe 1967 Red Sox, who are being celebrated throughout this season on the 50th anniversary of being the \"Cardiac Kids\" for their comeback victories, had only five walk-off triumphs that year. This season's Sox most closely resemble the surprising 2013 champions, who had 11 walk-off victories.\n\nThe 2004 team, the ultimate never-say-die club, had nine walk-off wins during the regular season and three more during the playoffs.\n\n\"There is a resiliency that keeps growing inside of a game,\" manager John Farrell said, \"and that's evolving as the season goes along. They grind away and find a way to win. Our guys do a great job of staying in the moment\"\n\nYanks' shakeup at closer: Aroldis Chapman is out as the Yankees' closer. Yankees manager Joe Girardi said before Saturday night's game that the hard-throwing lefty, who gave up two runs in a non-save appearance in Friday's 9-6 loss to Boston, is being taken out of that role to work through some location issues.\n\nChapman - who has given up at least two runs in each of his past three outings - will be used \"at any point\" for now, Girardi said, though he stopped short of naming his replacement. Instead, Dellin Betances and David Robertson will be used based on the situation, to allow flexibility.\n\n\"He knows that he needs to get back on track and that he's scuffled a little bit,\" Girardi said. \"But he said 'I'm willing to do anything. I just want to win.'\"\n\nPomeranz hopeful: Drew Pomeranz is optimistic he will make his next start on schedule, according to Farrell. That would be Wednesday in Cleveland. Pomeranz had to leave Friday night's game in the fourth inning due to a back spasm near his right beltline. The team will get a more definite read on Pomeranz' availability when he does his between-starts throwing on Monday.\n\nKelly off his game: Joe Kelly is suffering from irregularity, according to Farrell.\n\nThe unpredictable right-hander has been beyond awful since returning from the disabled list earlier this month. He is trending in a bad direction, having given up one, then two, then three runs in consecutive appearances. Kelly's ERA went from 1.45 to 2.52 in that span. It was 1.04 on July 3.\n\nThe time on the DL and his inconsistent usage recently has taken its toll, Farrell said, adding, \"He's had a pretty regimented use pattern, more so than anybody else on the team and he flourished with that. We're trying to get back to that.\"\n\nKelly has blown three saves, all the games being 3-2 when he entered, in his past five appearances and is 0 for 5 in save situations for his career.\n\nRegular-season finale: The series ends at 1:35 Sunday and the game will mark the Yankees' last visit to Fenway in the regular season. The possibility of post-season play remains, of course. The starting pitchers will be Rick Porcello for Boston, Sonny Gray for New York.\n\nPorcello has won his past three starts in succession, his longest such streak since he won six straight from June 28 through July 29 last year. He is 7-14 with a 4.59 ERA overall this year. Three of those losses have been at the hands of the Yankees. Boston has not scored a run for Porcello in 19 innings in those games.\n\nThis will be Gray's fourth start for New York. He is 1-2, 3.00 in the previous three and 7-7 with a 3.37 ERA for the season. Gray is 1-2 with a 5.16 ERA in four lifetimes starts against Boston, all of them coming when he pitched for Oakland.\n\nRuthian task: Gary Sanchez has begun to make his move on Babe Ruth.\n\nRuth is the all-time leader in home runs against the Red Sox with 90. Lou Gehrig is a distant second with 70. Other Yankees with a lot of home runs versus Boston are Joe DiMaggio with 46 and Yogi Berra with 38.\n\nSanchez' early pace is way ahead of everybody except Ruth. He had nine home runs in his first 20 games against the Red Sox, same as Ruth, who hit his 10th in his 21st game versus Boston. Gehrig had just four in his first 20 games against the Sox, DiMaggio three and Berra one.\n\nA tribute to Remy: The Red Sox plan to honor Jerry Remy before Sunday's game. This is Remy's 30th season working as a broadcast analyst for NESN although he is currently sidelined as he recovers from treatment for lung cancer. He is expected to throw out the ceremonial first ball.\n\nHe has been out since the All Star break. Remy, 64, has worked more than 3,900 Red Sox games during his career. He also played in 710 games for Boston from 1978 through 1984.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:55:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3652, "date": "2017-06-28", "amb": false, "textStart": 3629,

If there as a night to roll over, this was it.\n\nThe 'pen gave a 3-2 lead away with an excruciating four-run seventh. The inning should have been deflating, but instead, the Sox bats roared back with a four-run frame of their own in the bottom half to reclaim the lead.\n\nIt was an impressive display of mental toughness, and from there they cruised to another signature win.\n\nHere are five nuggets from the 9-6 victory that boosted the Sox AL East lead to five games:\n\n1. Mitch Moreland delivers the dagger\n\nAfter three and a half hours on the bench, Moreland was called upon to pinch hit with the bases loaded. His single up the middle scored two.\n\n2. Bullpen blues\n\nMatt Barnes, Joe Kelly, Heath Hembree and Robby Scott were all ineffective, combining for six runs in two innings of work.\n\n3. Sox have Aroldis Chapman's number\n\nFor the third time in eight days, the Red Sox scored two earned runs off of Chapman. The flamethrower only allowed two runs once in an outing last season.\n\n4. Rafael Devers delivers again\n\nRookie blasted a two-run homer, and later smoked a single off of Chapman, becoming only the eighth lefty with multiple hits off of him.\n\n5. Addison Reed gets back on track\n\nSetup man had one of his best outings in a Red Sox uniform, finally stopping the bleeding in the seventh and throwing a scoreless eighth.\n\nChris Mason is a Red Sox beat writer for CNHI Sports Boston.

Steal a few wins, rattle off a gorgeous run when people didn't expect you to -- what should or shouldn't happen doesn't matter.\n\nAre the Sox really this good? At a certain point, it's irrelevant how many wins were lucky (Friday's, arguably), or against bad teams (the White Sox), or anything else. Those victories are cinderblocks in the standings that the Yankees are will find increasingly difficult to budge.\n\nThere's simply no challenging the value of banked wins, no eliminating them.\n\nLook, you didn't need Friday night's 9-6 Red Sox win over the Yankees to realize the Sox are resilient. All of August has been a coming out party: for a pitching staff that's making due without David Price, for an offense liberated by a 20-year-old third baseman who homered again Saturday, Rafael Devers, as the team adapts smoothly to the absence of Dustin Pedroia.\n\n\"We miss them,\" Sox manager John Farrell said Saturday night. \"There's no question we miss those two guys, and [are] really looking forward to their return. But it speaks volume to the team we have, the depth and talent that's here.\n\n\"What Raffy has done by coming up, and Eduardo [Nunez's] arrival here at the time when Pedey goes down, they've been instrumental in the way we've played. I don't know if you want to call it the next-man-up mentality, but we have not skipped a beat and guys are beginning to flourish and shouldering a greater burden.\"\n\nBut what, beyond this sense of resiliency, have you learned since the trade deadline? What can you tell about the Sox' future from watching them reach a season-high 19 games over .500?\n\nThat discussion is more complicated. The Sox are of the best anywhere, just as they were projected to be entering the year -- albeit with some different personnel fulfilling those predictions. They're just the second AL team to reach 70 wins.\n\nYet, it's fair to wonder how many times a reliever like Tommy Kahnle -- one of the Yankees' significant trade additions -- will let Mitch Moreland come through with a go-ahead hit on an 0-2 count in the seventh inning.\n\nIt's fair to wonder how many times Heath Hembree, Matt Barnes and Joe Kelly can fall into trouble without swing-and-miss stuff and be bailed out. Or how many times Farrell can keep holding back guys like Addison Reed, as the skipper did on Friday, until he really has no other choice -- and be let off the hook for those choices.\n\nThe Red Sox are homer-happy right now, with multiple long balls for the 9th time in 14 games. Those home runs could be long overdue, or it could be a cluster and an aberration.\n\nAgain, those questions start to diminish in importance. Because in the same way we talk about time running out for Price's return from injury, time also starts to run out for other teams.\n\nThere's a cushion of five games in the AL East going into Saturday's middle game of three with the Yankees, one of just four remaining head-to-head match-ups between the Sox and Yanks this season. The last time the Sox and Yankees were playing each other as the top two teams in the division this late in the year was 2011, a reminder of how quickly leads can dissipate.\n\nThis isn't a suggestion the Sox should be foolhardy, or have anything wrapped up. It's a reminder that whether you believe Eduardo Nunez will keep up his .361 average down the stretch, or whether you find anything dubious about some of these Sox wins -- they're still in the bank, appreciating in value from now until October.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:13:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "04:13:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "303714", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "score": 2}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 2}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "305023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 3}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 3}, {"id": "310669", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "score": 2}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 5}, {"id": "312734", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "score": 3}, {"id": "314182", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "314218", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League East"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "score": 2}, {"id": "325678", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "score": 3}, {"id": "327123", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "David Price (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Price_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "327984", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dustin Pedroia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Pedroia", "score": 3}, {"id": "334426", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Matt Barnes"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Barnes", "score": 2}, {"id": "334427", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Farrell (manager)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Farrell_(manager)", "score": 3}, {"id": "375368", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Debutante"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debutante", "score": 3}, {"id": "423231", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Addison Reed"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Reed", "score": 2}, {"id": "437478", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mitch Moreland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Moreland", "score": 2}, {"id": "484820", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tommy Kahnle"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Kahnle", "score": 2}, {"id": "505379", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Banked turn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banked_turn", "score": 3}, {"id": "1307475", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heath Hembree"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants_minor_league_players#Heath_Hembree", "score": 2}], "image": "http://www.csnne.com/sites/csnne/files/2017/08/19/red_sox_andrew_benintendi_081817.jpg", "timeCrawl": "15:43:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Drellich: Forget Red Sox resiliency or luck, banked wins are what matter", "originalArticle": null}

I'm not doing this for the money or anything like that. I'm doing this for fun and to try to win a championship and if I can't have fun and help this team win, then there's no reason for me to be out there.\"\n\nBut he's back -- and now he has to go against Boston's best, a night after the Yankees blew another game to their rivals.\n\nSabathina (9-5, 4.05 ERA) hasn't won since improving to 9-3 on July 21 and is 0-2 in his last three starts, allowing four earned runs in each and working a total of just 13 1/3 innings.\n\nHowever, he has pitched twice against the Red Sox this season -- and hasn't allowed a run in 14 innings while winning both.\n\nOn July 16, at Fenway, Sabathia danced in and out of trouble but made it through six shutout innings despite a season-high five walks.\n\nSale got his first look at the New York part of the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry when he pitched for Boston last Sunday night in the Bronx.\n\nHe noticed the difference from the days he pitched for the Chicago White Sox.\n\n\"You can feel it,\" Sale told WEEI earlier this week. \"People in New York have never been really nice to me, but they hate me now. I heard some pretty interesting things out in the bullpen last time warming up. ... I don't go to New York to make friends.\"\n\nSale faces the Yankees for the fourth time this season -- the third at Fenway Park.\n\nThe Red Sox planned ahead when they had Sale on target to pitch in all three series between the teams in a 23-day span -- with good reason.\n\nHe is 4-2 with a ridiculous 1.18 ERA in 13 career outings -- 10 starts -- against the Yankees. He is 0-1 with a no-decision this year against New York with a 1.19 ERA and 35 strikeouts in 22 2/3 innings.\n\nSale, the Cy Young front-runner who is also being mentioned in the MVP talk, enters this game 14-4 with a 2.51 ERA -- and the Red Sox have scored five runs in his four losses.\n\nMookie Betts is Boston's leading hitter against Sabathia, who is 15-13 with a 4.22 lifetime against Boston, 6-5 with a 4.95 at Fenway Park. Betts is 7-for-16 (.353) but Hanley Ramirez is just 2-for-16 (.125, with a homer), Xander Bogaerts 4-for-24 (.167), Jackie Bradley Jr. 6-for-25 (.192) with 11 strikeouts and Chris Young 3-for-14 (.214).\n\nThe current Yankees have some ugly numbers against Sale. Aaron Judge is 0-for-7 with six strikeouts, Brett Gardner 2-for-16 (.125) and Gary Sanchez and Ronald Torreyes both 2-for-11 (.182). Aaron Hicks is 7-for-19 (.368) and Chase Headley 7-for-23 (.304) with two homers.\n\nFriday night's comeback win was the Red Sox's second straight over the Yankees and moved them five games ahead of

Steal a few wins, rattle off a gorgeous run when people didn't expect you to -- what should or shouldn't happen doesn't matter.\n\nAre the Sox really this good? At a certain point, it's irrelevant how many wins were lucky (Friday's, arguably), or against bad teams (the White Sox), or anything else. Those victories are cinderblocks in the standings that the Yankees are will find increasingly difficult to budge.\n\nThere's simply no challenging the value of banked wins, no eliminating them.\n\nLook, you didn't need Friday night's 9-6 Red Sox win over the Yankees to realize the Sox are resilient. All of August has been a coming out party: for a pitching staff that's making due without David Price, for an offense liberated by a 20-year-old third baseman who homered again Saturday, Rafael Devers, as the team adapts smoothly to the absence of Dustin Pedroia.\n\n\"We miss them,\" Sox manager John Farrell said Saturday night. \"There's no question we miss those two guys, and [are] really looking forward to their return. But it speaks volume to the team we have, the depth and talent that's here.\n\n\"What Raffy has done by coming up, and Eduardo [Nunez's] arrival here at the time when Pedey goes down, they've been instrumental in the way we've played. I don't know if you want to call it the next-man-up mentality, but we have not skipped a beat and guys are beginning to flourish and shouldering a greater burden.\"\n\nBut what, beyond this sense of resiliency, have you learned since the trade deadline? What can you tell about the Sox' future from watching them reach a season-high 19 games over .500?\n\nThat discussion is more complicated. The Sox are of the best anywhere, just as they were projected to be entering the year -- albeit with some different personnel fulfilling those predictions. They're just the second AL team to reach 70 wins.\n\nYet, it's fair to wonder how many times a reliever like Tommy Kahnle -- one of the Yankees' significant trade additions -- will let Mitch Moreland come through with a go-ahead hit on an 0-2 count in the seventh inning.\n\nIt's fair to wonder how many times Heath Hembree, Matt Barnes and Joe Kelly can fall into trouble without swing-and-miss stuff and be bailed out. Or how many times Farrell can keep holding back guys like Addison Reed, as the skipper did on Friday, until he really has no other choice -- and be let off the hook for those choices.\n\nThe Red Sox are homer-happy right now, with multiple long balls for the 9th time in 14 games. Those home runs could be long overdue, or it could be a cluster and an aberration.\n\nAgain, those questions start to diminish in importance. Because in the same way we talk about time running out for Price's return from injury, time also starts to run out for other teams.\n\nThere's a cushion of five games in the AL East going into Saturday's middle game of three with the Yankees, one of just four remaining head-to-head match-ups between the Sox and Yanks this season. The last time the Sox and Yankees were playing each other as the top two teams in the division this late in the year was 2011, a reminder of how quickly leads can dissipate.\n\nThis isn't a suggestion the Sox should be foolhardy, or have anything wrapped up. It's a reminder that whether you believe Eduardo Nunez will keep up his .361 average down the stretch, or whether you find anything dubious about some of these Sox wins -- they're still in the bank, appreciating in value from now until October.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T00:18:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "00:18:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "303714", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "score": 2}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 2}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "305023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 3}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 3}, {"id": "310669", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "score": 2}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 5}, {"id": "312734", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "score": 3}, {"id": "314182", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "314218", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League East"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "score": 2}, {"id": "325678", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "score": 3}, {"id": "327123", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "David Price (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Price_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "327984", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dustin Pedroia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Pedroia", "score": 3}, {"id": "334426", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Matt Barnes"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Barnes", "score": 2}, {"id": "334427", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Farrell (manager)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Farrell_(manager)", "score": 3}, {"id": "375368", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Debutante"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debutante", "score": 3}, {"id": "423231", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Addison Reed"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Reed", "score": 2}, {"id": "437478", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mitch Moreland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Moreland", "score": 2}, {"id": "484820", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tommy Kahnle"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Kahnle", "score": 2}, {"id": "505379", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Banked turn"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banked_turn", "score": 3}, {"id": "1307475", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heath Hembree"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants_minor_league_players#Heath_Hembree", "score": 2}], "image": "http://www.csnne.com/sites/csnne/files/2017/08/18/red_sox_drew_pomeranz_081717.jpg", "timeCrawl": "06:25:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Drew Pomeranz leaves start vs. Yankees with back spasms", "originalArticle": null}

No Dustin Pedroia. No problem.\n\nWhen David Price went on the disabled list on July 28 followed shortly thereafter by Dustin Pedroia, it seemed like Boston's season had come to a crossroads.\n\nLosing two veteran players to injury is never a good thing for a young team, but instead of dooming the Red Sox, the absence of Pedroia and Price has further solidified the club.\n\nBoston picked up right where it left off after last weekend's dramatic series in New York with another come-from-behind thriller on Friday night against the Yankees.\n\nThe Red Sox lost a 3-2 lead in the seventh, falling behind 6-3 only to post four runs in the bottom of the inning to take a 7-6 lead en route to a 9-6 win.\n\nIt was the same resiliency the club has shown throughout the season and particularly in its nine walkoff wins this year.\n\nThe Red Sox didn't need the walk-off drama on Friday, but they needed timely hitting and they got it in the seventh when Mitch Moreland, pinch-hitting for Chris Young, smacked a two-run single to push the Red Sox ahead.\n\n\"We're pretty good at it this year, it seems like,\" Moreland said of Boston's flair for the dramatic. \"We're never out of the game. We're always fighting.\"\n\nAfter falling behind 6-3 thanks to a bullpen implosion in the top of the seventh, the Red Sox got to work. Christian Vazquez singled with one out, Jackie Bradley Jr. followed with a walk and Eduardo Nunez loaded the bases with an infield single.\n\nMookie Betts hit a sacrifice fly and Andrew Benintendi followed with an RBI single to bring Boston within 6-5 before Moreland's big base hit.\n\n\"That was pretty neat,\" Bradley said. \"It was a great way to start the series and to finish this game. We showed a lot of resiliency being able to bounce back and nobody gave up.\"\n\nWhile Pedroia was hitting over .300 at the time he went on the DL and Price had been pitching well, the Red Sox hardly seem to miss the pair.\n\n\"There's no question we miss those two guys and really looking forward to their return,\" Red Sox manager John Farrell said. \"But it speaks volumes to the team we have, the depth and talent that's here. What Raffy has done by coming up, and Eduardo's arrival here at the time when Pedey goes down, they've been instrumental in the way we've played.\n\n\"I don't know if you want to call it the next-man-up mentality but we have not skipped a beat and guys are beginning to flourish and shouldering a greater burden.\"\n\nThe win Friday night moved Boston five games ahead of New York for for first place in the American League East with six games to play against the division foes.\n\nThe veterans might be absent but the kids are doing all right.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T11:05:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 110, "textStart": 103, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-28", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.545098066329956, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "11:05:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 2}, {"id": "303713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "score": 2}, {"id": "304989", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disabled list"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disabled_list", "score": 4}, {"id": "305018", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "score": 3}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "305786", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "score": 4}, {"id": "305865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "score": 2}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 5}, {"id": "310657", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "score": 3}, {"id": "310668", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "score": 2}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 3}, {"id": "314176", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "score": 3}, {"id": "314179", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Deputy Lieutenant"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Lieutenant", "score": 2}, {"id": "325672", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (B)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(B)", "score": 3}, {"id": "327123", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "David Price (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Price_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "327983", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox_minor_league_players#Mookie_Betts", "score": 2}, {"id": "327984", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Dustin Pedroia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Pedroia", "score": 5}, {"id": "334427", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Farrell (manager)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Farrell_(manager)", "score": 2}, {"id": "396581", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "score": 2}, {"id": "428880", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jackie Bradley, Jr."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Bradley,_Jr.", "score": 2}, {"id": "437478", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mitch Moreland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Moreland", "score": 3}, {"id": "1283126", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Andrew Benintendi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Benintendi", "score": 2}, {"id": "1297275", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Christian V\u00e1zquez"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_V\u00e1zquez", "score": 2}], "image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/redsox_impact/photo/23261073-standard.jpg", "timeCrawl": "11:33:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "David Price, Dustin Pedroia on DL seems no problem for resilient Boston Red Sox; club moves to 12-2 in August", "originalArticle": null}

He was hurt by the long ball as rookie Tyler Austin reached him for a three-run homer in the second and veteran Todd Frazier hit a solo shot in the sixth.\n\nThe current best lefty in the American League, and a past one, went arm-to-arm here on Saturday night and the veteran prevailed.\n\nC.C. Sabathia held the Red Sox to two runs through six innings and the Yankees held on to beat Chris Sale, 4-3.\n\nSale, who went seven innings, suffered his first loss since July 6. He was hurt by the long ball as rookie Tyler Austin reached him for a three-run homer in the second and veteran Todd Frazier hit a solo shot in the sixth.\n\nConversely, Sale was saved from possible damage by Jackie Bradley Jr., who made another fabulous catch in center. This time he went back to the wire fence in that wall in the fourth and leapt to take extra bases away from Austin.\n\nSale is 0-2 in four starts against the Yankees this year. The Red Sox have scored a total of two runs for him, both Saturday night, in those four games.\n\nSabathia carried a 17-inning shutout streak versus the Red Sox into the game and extended it to 21 before Boston batters finally got to him.\n\nThe veteran southpaw made it look very easy in the very early going. He set down the first eight Red Sox hitters in order without a ball leaving the infield. Sabathia struck out three, got three infield outs and retired two Sox on line drives.\n\nHe caught one of the line drives and it was a bit miraculous. Mookie Betts toasted one right up the middle with one out in the first and the ball landed in Sabathia's glove, more of it showing outside the glove than in the pocket. But it was an out.\n\nBradley became the first Boston batter to reach base when he dropped a soft single into left field with two out in the third. Eduardo Nunez, finally getting a little cold, ended the inning with a ground ball to second base.\n\nSabathia remained in control after that, at least for a while. He set the Red Sox down in order in the fourth and got Chris Young on a groundout to third base starting the fifth. Sabathia then issued his first walk of the game, Xander Bogaerts reaching via a base on balls, and Rafael Devers singled to right to move Bogaerts over to third base.\n\nSandy Leon drove in Boston's first run with a soft ground ball to second with Devers moving up a base. Bradley cut New York's lead to 3-2 with another hit to left, Devers just beating Brett Gardner's throw home.\n\nUncharacteristically, Sale slowed his team's momentum by giving back a run in the top of the sixth. It came with two out when Frazier hit a high fly that barely made it into the monster seats. Sale finished his night strongly as he struck out three in the seventh, the outs surrounding a single to right by Gardner.\n\nBoston got that run back in the seventh with Sabathia out of the game and Adam Warren in. After Bogaerts struck out, Devers drilled a line drive to the triangle that hit the wall behind the Boston bullpen just barely fair.

But Scott walked Gardner then hit the next batter, Aaron Hicks, to push a fourth run across the board, giving New York a 6-3 lead.\n\n\"We're in a 3-2 game and at that time, trying not to pitch Addison Reed two innings to get to (Craig) Kimbrel,\" Farrell said. \"Just looking to find a way to match up and get through the seventh. Unfortunately we sent a lot of guys to the mound, a lot of balls in play.\"\n\nFarrell didn't have much choice but to turn to Reed at that point.\n\nLast Friday, Reed was the one who blew the game for the Red Sox, allowing four runs in New York and not recording an out in a 5-4 loss.\n\nA week later, Reed entered with runners on second and third to face Aaron Judge.\n\nThe reliever got Judge swinging after a seven-pitch battle and then ended the rough inning with a line out to first base.\n\n\"It was a big opportunity and A.R. handled it with poise facing a very talented hitter. That was big,\" Jackie Bradley Jr. said. \"That was a big momentum shift for us.\"\n\nThe Red Sox rallied in the bottom of the inning with four runs of their own to take a 7-6 lead.\n\nReed entered in the top of the eighth and got a fly out and strikeout before issuing a walk to Todd Frazier. He ended the frame four pitches later with a strikeout of Ronald Torreyes.\n\nThe 1 2/3 innings of hitless ball was perhaps Reed's most dominant outing with Boston.\n\nThe difference?\n\n\"Just throwing the slider for a strike, locating my fastball,\" Reed said. \"Everything was just kind of clicking today.

Now they're at it again.\n\nA spark, a buzz, a hum. It's been six years that all three have been missing from the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. Not missing in a way that we were putting up signs, offering rewards for finding them. No, the rivalry was dwindling in a more acceptable manner. Almost like we were ready to move on, take a break, see what else is out there. We entertained the idea that the rivalry had run its course. We looked to other division match ups to fill our void. The Dodgers and the Giants? Nah, not the same. Astros and Rangers? Nope, still lacking. Cubs and Cards? Not this year.\n\nSomething, anything, kept bringing us back to the Yankees and the Red Sox. While the media continued to tout the rivalry out of habit for the past six years, it wasn't clicking. Then, David Ortiz played his final game at Yankee Stadium -- complete with a ceremony, gift, and weirdest of all, cheers. Even Ortiz wasn't sure whether he'd get boos or claps in that final game. He expected the former. Why? The rivalry. So when Big Papi signed off, so did we.\n\nThen, Aaron Judge happened. Raphael Devers was introduced. Gary Sanchez hit bombs. Jackie Bradley Jr. robbed dingers. The list of jaw-dropping rivalry moments this year are too fun to ignore. So let's review.\n\nKey moments that sparked the revival of a rivalry:\n\n1. Aug. 13: Devers' game-tying solo smash against Aroldis Chapman in the 9th\n\n2. Aug. 11: Aaron Hicks' two-run homer in the 8th, leading to a comeback win for Yankees\n\n3. July 16: Bradley Jr. extending his arm over the wall, robbing Judge of a two-run homer in the 8th\n\n4. July 15: Holliday's game-tying jack over the Red Monster against Craig Kimbrel in the 9th\n\n5. July 15: The five-hour-and-50-minute game, New York capitalizing in the 16th inning at Fenway Park\n\n1) David Price arguing with Boston media and naturally stirring excitement in New York fans. Price flooded New York radio talk shows for weeks straight, causing the Yankees' media to reflect on their own bullish questioning. We compared and contrasted not just the two rival teams, but the similarities between Boston and New York media as well.\n\n2) The promise of young stars growing in talent and performing well throughout the rivalry. Clint Frazier, Andrew Benintendi, Sanchez, Devers and Judge are all here to stay until at least 2019. These fresh faces are giving us the spark, hum and buzz back to the rivalry not just this season, but at least a few more years to come.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2011, the Yankees and Red Sox kept each other in check. They finished first and second in the American League East for five out of those nine years. Out of those five years, the Red Sox came out on top only in 2007, when the Yankees finished just two games back. Their largest margin came in 2009, the Red Sox finishing eight games behind the Bronx Bombers. And their smallest in 2005, the squads finishing in a 95-67 tie.\n\nNow, the teams are battling yet again. In the 12 games they've played this season, nine have been decided by three runs or less.

Sabathia held the Red Sox to two runs through six innings and the Yankees held on to beat Chris Sale, 4-3.\n\nSale, who went seven innings, suffered his first loss since July 6. He was hurt by the long ball as rookie Tyler Austin launched a three-run homer in the second and veteran Todd Frazier hit a solo shot in the sixth.\n\nConversely, Sale was saved from possible damage by Jackie Bradley Jr., who made another fabulous catch in center. This time he went back to the wire fence in that wall in the fourth and leapt to take extra bases away from Austin.\n\nSale is 0-2 in four starts against the Yankees this year.\n\nSabathia carried a 17-inning shutout streak versus the Red Sox into the game and extended it to 21 before Boston batters finally got to him.\n\nThe veteran southpaw made it look very easy in the very early going. He set down the first eight Red Sox hitters in order without a ball leaving the infield. Sabathia struck out three, got three infield outs and retired two Sox on line drives.\n\nHe caught one of the line drives and it was a bit miraculous. Mookie Betts toasted one right up the middle with one out in the first and the ball landed in Sabathia's glove, more of it showing outside the glove than in the pocket. But it was an out.\n\nBradley became the first Boston batter to reach base when he dropped a soft single into left field with two out in the third. Eduardo Nunez, finally getting a little cold, ended the inning with a ground ball to second base.\n\nSabathia remained in control after that, at least for a while. He set the Red Sox down in order in the fourth and got Chris Young on a groundout to third base starting the fifth. Sabathia then issued his first walk of the game, Xander Bogaerts reaching via a base on balls, and Rafael Devers singled to right to move Bogaerts over to third base.\n\nSandy Leon drove in Boston's first run with a soft ground ball to second with Devers moving up a base. Bradley cut New York's lead to 3-2 with another hit to left, Devers just beating Brett Gardner's throw home.\n\nUncharacteristically, Sale slowed his team's momentum by giving back a run in the top of the sixth. It came with two out when Frazier hit a high fly that barely made it into the monster seats. Sale finished his night strongly as he struck out three in the seventh, the outs surrounding a single to right by Gardner.\n\nBoston got that run back in the seventh with Sabathia out of the game and Adam Warren in. After Bogaerts struck out, Devers drilled a line drive to the triangle that hit the wall behind the Boston bullpen just barely out. It was the rookie's eighth homer of the season in a mere 20 games.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:11:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 469, "textStart": 463, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-06", "amb":

East to a substantial lead. Boston's victories have generally been in dramatic fashion, and the Sox already have nine walk-off wins in 2017, six more than they had all of last year when they captured the American League East championship.\n\n\"It's playing hard, and playing hard for nine innings no matter the score is,\" said Mookie Betts of Boston's penchant for late-game heroics.\n\nThe 1967 Red Sox, who are being celebrated throughout this season on the 50th anniversary of being the \"Cardiac Kids\" for their comeback victories, had just five walk-off triumphs that year. This season's Sox most closely resemble the surprising 2013 champions, who had 11 walk-off victories.\n\nThe 2004 team, the ultimate never-say-die club, had nine walk-off wins during the regular season and three more during the playoffs.\n\n\"There is a resiliency that keeps growing inside of a game,\" manager John Farrell said, \"and that's evolving as the season goes along. They grind away and find a way to win. Our guys do a great job of staying in the moment\"\n\nChapman removed as closer\n\nAroldis Chapman is out as the Yankees' closer. Yankees manager Joe Girardi said before Saturday night's game that the hard-throwing lefty, who gave up two runs in a non-save appearance in Friday's 9-6 loss to Boston, is being taken out of that role to work through some location issues.\n\nChapman -- who has given up at least two runs in each of his last three outings -- will be used \"at any point\" for now, Girardi said, though he stopped short of naming his replacement. Instead, Dellin Betances and David Robertson will be used based on the situation, to allow flexibility.\n\n\"He knows that he needs to get back on track and that he's scuffled a little bit,\" Girardi said. \"But he said 'I'm willing to do anything. I just want to win.'\"\n\nPomeranz hopeful\n\nDrew Pomeranz is optimistic he will make his next start on schedule, according to Farrell. That would be Wednesday in Cleveland. Pomeranz had to leave Friday night's game in the fourth inning due to a back spasm near his right belt line. The team will get a more definite read on Pomeranz' availability when he does his between-starts throwing on Monday.\n\nKelly off his game\n\nJoe Kelly is suffering from irregularity, according to pitching doctor Farrell.\n\nThe unpredictable right-hander has been beyond awful since returning from the disabled list earlier this month. He is trending in a bad direction, having given up one, then two, then three runs in consecutive appearances. Kelly's ERA went from 1.45 to 2.52 in that span. It was 1.04 on July 3.\n\nThe time on the DL and his inconsistent usage recently has taken its toll, Farrell said, adding, \"He's had a pretty regimented use pattern, more so than anybody else on the team and he flourished with that. We're trying to get back to that.\"\n\nKelly has blown three saves, all the games being 3-2 when he entered, in his last five appearances and is 0-for-5 in save situations for his career.\n\nRegular-season finale\n\nThe series ends at 1:35 Sunday and the game will mark the Yankees' last visit to Fenway in the regular season. The possibility of postseason play remains, of course. The starting pitchers will be Rick Porcello for Boston, and Sonny Gray for New York.\n\nPorcello has won his last three starts in succession, his longest such streak since he won six straight from June 28 through July 29 last year. He is 7-14 with a 4.59 ERA overall this year. Three of those losses have been at the hands of the Yankees. Boston has not scored a run for Porcello in 19 innings in those games.\n\nThis will be Gray's fourth start for New York. He is 1-2, 3.00 in the previous three and 7-7 with a 3.37 ERA for the season.\n\nA tribute to Remy\n\nThe Red Sox plan to honor Jerry Remy before Sunday's game. This is Remy's 30th season working as a broadcast analyst for NESN although he is currently sidelined as he recovers from treatment for lung cancer. He is expected to throw out the ceremonial first ball.\n\nHe has been out since the All Star break. Remy, 64, has worked more than 3,900 Red Sox games during his career. He also played in 710 games for Boston from 1978 through 1984.\n\n-- Bill Ballou writes for the Worcester Telegram & Gazette of GateHouse Media.

But when Addison Reed came on to shut it down -- and then a big eighth inning on his part -- we end up right back in a big situation to close things out.\"\n\nReed pitched 1 \u00b2/\u2083 scoreless innings -- and the most critical of the five outs he recorded was the first, when he got Judge swinging on a 3-2 fastball off the outside corner.\n\n\"I just wanted to get him out over the plate,\" Judge said of his approach in the at-bat. \"At the end, he got me with a fastball that started at the corner and ran right off at the end. I wasn't able to foul it off.\"\n\nAfter the Red Sox came back with four runs in the bottom of the inning, Reed threw a scoreless eighth and allowed Farrell to get the ball to closer Craig Kimbrel for the save.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T07:34:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 122, "textStart": 115, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-12", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.529411792755127, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "07:34:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "216987", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 2}, {"id": "305018", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "score": 2}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 4}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "305344", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Order (biology)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)", "score": 3}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 3}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 3}, {"id": "310537", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "score": 3}, {"id": "310548", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "score": 2}, {"id": "310591", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "311917", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "At bat"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "score": 2}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 5}, {"id": "334427", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Farrell (manager)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Farrell_(manager)", "score": 2}, {"id": "339036", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "score": 2}, {"id": "396509", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bases loaded"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(B)#bases_loaded", "score": 3}, {"id": "403817", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "score": 3}, {"id": "423231", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Addison Reed"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Reed", "score": 4}], "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/judge9.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "timeCrawl": "07:34:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "This time Addison Reed shuts down the Yankees", "originalArticle": null}

Two World Series rings later, Lennon left the Yankees' beat after the 1998 season, bounced between the Bronx and Shea for the next three years, then took over on the Mets for the demise of Bobby Valentine in 2002. He became Newsday's national baseball writer in 2012.\n\nLennon also is a Hall of Fame voter, a former Chairman of the New York Chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America and co-author of \"The Great New York Sports Debate.\" Show More\n\nemail twitter\n\nBOSTON -- Regardless of how this weekend on Yawkey Way plays out -- assuming the road isn't called Big Papi Drive by Sunday -- it's a fairly safe bet that both the Yankees and Red Sox will make the postseason, in some capacity. While nothing is going to be decided six weeks from the finish line, Joe Girardi & Co. carry the burden of an increasing sense of urgency that goes beyond the deficit they face in the American League East.\n\nLet's just say the events of the only sudden-death playoff game in the Bronx, back in 2015, is not going be made into a \"Yankeeography\" any time soon. That one-and-done at the hands of the Astros -- piloted by their ace, Dallas Keuchel -- is among this franchise's worst October memories. Mercifully, the humiliation was relatively brief, capped at one night.\n\nLatest columns Lennon: As usual, it's Murphy's law for Mets Lennon: Despite loss, there are positives for Mets Lennon: DeGrom gave Mets hope, but not win vs. Yanks Lennon: Advantage Yanks, especially in the pen Lennon: Benintendi might catch Judge for ROY\n\nIn the history of the do-or-die wild-card game, which was implemented for the 2012 season, five of the 10 winners at least made it to the League Championship Series. The 2014 World Series featured a pair of wild cards, with the Giants outlasting the Royals in a superb seven games. So it's certainly possible to use the sport's consolation prize as a springboard.\n\n\"If you're in, you're in,\" Red Sox manager John Farrell said.\n\nEasy for him to say, with Boston holding a four-game lead over the Yankees heading into Friday's series opener. In total, the Red Sox had an eight-game cushion for a playoff spot overall, counting the distance between them and the Royals, the team a half-game out of the second wild-card team. That's a sizable safety net, courtesy of their 48-30 (. 615) mark since May 21, the AL's best record over that period and second in the majors, behind the supernatural Dodgers (60-15).\n\nYankeesBack from DL, Sabathia faces Sale on Saturday\n\nAnd what if the Yankees can't catch the Sox? At least there's no one on the level of a '15 Keuchel waiting for them again, judging by the wild-card pack nipping at their heels. The Angels' Parker Bridwell? The Royals' Jason Vargas? The Twins' Ervin Santana? None of those seem capable of turning out the lights in the Bronx like Keuchel, who had a knack for neutralizing the Yankees that season (22 scoreless innings).\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nNot that Girardi should be preparing any concession speeches. After these three at Fenway, the Yankees still host the Sox for four in New York (Aug. 31-Sept. 3) with Greg Bird, Starlin Castro and maybe Matt Holliday all expected back by then. After missing the playoffs three out of the last four years, the Yankees probably don't view the wild card with as much disdain as they used to. But they'd obviously prefer the other route in, over the Red Sox.\n\n\"You always want to feel like you're in control of your own destiny,\" Girardi said.\n\nThere's no reason to think the Red Sox are going to suddenly fall apart down the stretch, not with Chris Sale -- who faces CC Sabathia on Saturday -- positioned as the stopper and dominant Craig Kimbrel at the back end of the bullpen. Like the Yankees, Boston also has game-changing rookies, with Andrew Benintendi and Rafael Devers, the latter delivering a two-run homer Friday night) -- his seventh in only 19 games.\n\nNot so great for the Red Sox was Drew Pomeranz, their sterling No. 2 starter, having to leave Friday's game with back spasms with one out in the fourth inning, midway through Chase Headley's at-bat. Pomeranz, who entered 12-4 with a 3.39 ERA, was through three scoreless innings before he rifled a fastball to the backstop. That brought out Farrell and the trainer, and after a pair of test pitches, Pomeranz was unable to continue, then later was diagnosed with back spasms.\n\nWhile that didn't appear serious, it doesn't sound like the Yankees will have to worry about seeing David Price down the stretch. The Red Sox's ailing $217-million lefthander, most recently shut down because of recurring elbow inflammation, has been incapable of resuming any semblance of a throwing program. When Farrell was pressed on Price again Friday, the manager suggested he wasn't close.\n\n\"I don't have a return date at all,\" Farrell said.\n\nSo Price may be sitting this one out. Too bad for him. Could be a fascinating race.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T03:30:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3602, "date": "2017-08-31", "amb": false, "textStart": 3587, "dateEnd": "2017-09-03", "imp": true},

Entering last Friday they were 4.5 games behind before losing two out of three, and with the Red Sox off on Thursday the Yankees were going to be either four or five games behind them entering this weekend, depending on the outcome of Thursday night's Subway Series finale.\n\nThere is another opportunity here for the Yankees to close the gap in the race for the AL East crown, and each passing series becomes bigger and bigger because the Yanks know the season is winding down.\n\n\"As the season progresses - we're in the middle of August and it'll be the end of August before too long - you start to run out of time to catch up,\" Brett Gardner said Thursday. \"Obviously chasing them, four or five games back or whatever it is, all the games we play from here on out are very important, especially the games we play against them. So it's an important weekend and it's important we continue to try to win.\"\n\nLast weekend's series started well for the Yanks with a 5-4 win before they dropped the final two games to Boston, the Sunday night defeat coming after Aroldis Chapman blew the save in the ninth inning and gave up another run in the 10th.\n\nMets catcher Travis d'Arnaud plays third base vs. Yankees\n\nChapman remained unavailable Thursday after he felt something in his hamstring on Tuesday, when he gave up two more runs. \"I think we're gonna have him throw a little bit more today and see how he feels,\" Joe Girardi said before Thursday's game. His availability for the start of the Red Sox series is unclear, but he remains the team's closer.\n\nThe Yanks will be facing a Red Sox team which has won 12 of its last 14 games, its latest feat a walkoff win Wednesday courtesy of Mookie Betts' two-run double with a full count and two outs in the ninth when the Sox were down by a run.\n\nThose are the kind of moments that can swing a pennant race, or potentially decide one. It also can do wonders for a clubhouse.\n\n\"Anytime you have a walkoff win like that, an exciting win, I think it's good for your team, morale and chemistry,\" Gardner said. \"It can only be a positive.\"\n\nGardner delivers a walk-off single as Yankees win 6th straight\n\nGardner said he was aware that the Red Sox won Wednesday and the fashion in which they did. He is cognizant of where the Yankees stand in relation to Boston but isn't looking too closely at the American League wild-card race; the Yanks currently hold the top wild-card spot.\n\n\"I know there's a lot of teams still in the wild-card race, still in the hunt, still in the playoff picture,\" Gardner said. \"It usually is until September 15 or 20. There's a lot of teams still fighting for the postseason, as are we. As long as we focus on ourselves and play good baseball, we don't have to worry about what anybody else is doing.\"\n\nWhat the Yankees had done before the Subway Series was disappointing. They were winless in four straight series before winning the first three against the Mets. There have been letdowns, but opportunities remain, even as fall baseball draws near.\n\n\"A little frustrating that we could've won the series against Boston,\" Gardner said. \"At their place we had a chance to win a few games after the All-Star break and we came up a little short, and the same thing last weekend at home. So we've just got to play a little better baseball, and hopefully we'll continue to do that.\"\n\nTags: new york yankees boston red sox mlb brett gardner joe girardi Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T00:21:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2783, "textStart": 2771, "imp": true, "date": "2017-09-15", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.529411792755127, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "00:21:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "216987", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303711", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "score": 2}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 3}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "305794", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "307683", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 5}, {"id": "310584", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Aroldis Chapman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroldis_Chapman", "score": 3}, {"id": "310590", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310591", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310657", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "score": 2}, {"id": "310664", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Closer (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310669", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "score": 2}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 5}, {"id": "312740", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "score": 3}, {"id": "314175", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "314181", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "score": 3}, {"id": "314218", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League East"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "score": 3}, {"id": "325678", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "score": 3}, {"id": "327983", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox_minor_league_players#Mookie_Betts", "score": 2}, {"id": "361268", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Travis d'Arnaud"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_d'Arnaud", "score": 3}, {"id": "366221", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Joe Girardi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Girardi", "score": 2}, {"id": "411068", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pennant (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennant_(sports)", "score": 2}, {"id": "423229", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brett Gardner"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Gardner", "score": 3}, {"id": "432963", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Walkoff"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walk-off_home_run", "score": 3}], "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3421116.1503011956!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/831166200.jpg", "timeCrawl": "00:21:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Yankees series in Boston is one of last chances to catch Red Sox", "originalArticle": null}

But upon being traded to the Boston Red Sox, Sale now finds himself consistently under the bright lights, as well as a fixture in baseball's fiercest rivalry.\n\nThe Red Sox-Yankees rivalry features household names who were cornerstones of their respective franchise for quite some time: David Ortiz, Derek Jeter, Pedro Martinez and Alex Rodriguez, just to name a few. But despite being in just his first season with the Sox, Sale's role within the rivalry steadily has evolved, almost as if he's been a part of the American League East battle for years and years.\n\nBoston isn't the easiest place to play, but Sale seemingly embraced the city and the team the moment the Red Sox acquired him back in December. In a recent appearance on WEEI, Sale discussed his appreciation for the franchise's history, and also how excited he is to hopefully pitch in the postseason for the first time in his career.\n\n\"I can't wait,\" Sale said. \"That's the most exciting part about me being with this team. There's a lot of things that go in with being a part of the Boston Red Sox organization. We play at one of the coolest stadiums in all of sports. It's very rich in history. The players that have come through here, I mean, you're talking about retired numbers and Hall of Famers and all these things. It's all cool, but at the end of the day, we have a realistic shot of going all the way and being the last man standing, and that's exciting. That's what I signed up for.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for Sale to win over the hearts of Red Sox fans. His gritty attitude and fearlessness on the mound not only made him a fan favorite, but also the likely frontrunner for the AL Cy Young Award. Entering Saturday, Sale boasts a 14-4 record with a 2.51 ERA and an MLB-leading 241 strikeouts. Sale's success with the Red Sox, of course, has been much to the chagrin of Yankees fans, but the six-time All Star doesn't appear to care how he's viewed in New York.\n\n\"You can feel it,\" Sale told WEEI. \"You know. People in New York have never been really nice to me, but they hate me now. I heard some pretty interesting things out in the bullpen last time warming up. I don't go to New York to make friends.\"\n\nIronically enough, the Yankees probably could have outbid the Red Sox for Sale this winter. New York has one of the stronger farm systems in baseball due to a series of marquee trades, but the Bronx Bombers had a relatively quiet offseason. The Yankees seemingly were prepared to rebuild for the next two seasons ahead of the monster free-agent class in 2019.\n\nBut to the surprise of many, the Yankees have exceeded expectations this season and find themselves in a heated battle with the Red Sox for first place in the AL East. In hopes of capitalizing on this impressive season, New York acquired Sonny Gray in a deal with the Oakland Athletics at the MLB trade deadline. Gray is a fine starter who certainly will help the Yankees' push for the postseason, but he's no Sale.\n\nInstead, New York will have to watch the Red Sox ace dominate on the mound for the rest of this season, and probably for years to come.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:00:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "12:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "216987", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "218051", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303573", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "score": 5}, {"id": "303711", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "score": 5}, {"id": "304992", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "score": 2}, {"id": "304993", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "score": 2}, {"id": "305865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "score": 2}, {"id": "310097", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Derek Jeter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jeter", "score": 3}, {"id": "310461", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pedro Mart\u00ednez"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Mart\u00ednez", "score": 3}, {"id": "310462", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Farm team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team", "score": 2}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 5}, {"id": "310476", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "score": 1}, {"id": "310537", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "score": 2}, {"id": "310595", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "David Ortiz"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ortiz", "score": 3}, {"id": "312729", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale", "score": 4}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 4}, {"id": "312734", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "score": 4}, {"id": "312739", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "score": 2}, {"id": "314218", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League East"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "score": 3}, {"id": "339734", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Alex Rodriguez"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Rodriguez", "score": 3}, {"id": "372282", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "WEEI"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEEI", "score": 3}, {"id": "492325", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankees\u2013Red_Sox_rivalry", "score": 3}, {"id": "1297459", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_annual_home_run_leaders", "score": 2}], "image": "http://nesncom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/chris-sale_opt2.jpg?w=640", "timeCrawl": "12:06:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Chris Sale Quickly Becoming Driving Force In Red Sox-Yankees Rivalry", "originalArticle": null}

I know they're not playing [Thursday]. I knew they won [Wednesday] night.\"\n\nBut with the Yankees set to play another series against the Red Sox at Fenway Park beginning Friday night, Gardner insisted he was focused on what the Yankees have to do to make a run at the AL East crown.\n\n\"If we play the way we're capable of playing and worry about us, everything will take care of itself,\" Gardner said before the Yankees finished the Subway Series against the Mets with a 7-5 win at Citi Field. \"It's too early to worry about what everyone else is doing. I know there are a lot of teams in the playoff hunt and wild-card picture. We just need to win. It doesn't matter if we're playing the Red Sox, Mets or anyone in between. All the games are important right now, especially in our division.\"\n\nThe Yankees had a chance to make up some ground last week in The Bronx, but thanks to a poor outing by Luis Severino and a blown save by Aroldis Chapman, they slipped in the standings.\n\nA good series against the Mets helped the Yankees re-enter the race for the top of the division, but they have just seven games remaining against their AL East rivals.\n\n\"It's the middle of August and you start running out of time to catch up,\" Gardner said. \"We're chasing them, so it's an important weekend. ... We can make up a lot of ground in a little bit of time.\"\n\nCC Sabathia is slated to come off the disabled list and start Saturday's game, and the left-hander is looking forward to the stretch run.\n\n\"The goal is always to win the division,\" said Sabathia, who has been out because of pain in his surgically repaired right knee. \"It's good to have that chance.\"\n\nSabathia said he is relishing the opportunity to contribute.\n\n\"You want to be a part of what's going on here and do what you can,\" he said. \"I felt like I've done that for most of this year and want to get back to it.\"\n\nHe also understands that while the wild card is fine, winning the division makes a significant difference.\n\n\"It's a big deal because it guarantees you a series,\" Sabathia said. \"Any time you get into the tournament, you'll take it, but you want that series.\"\n\nAfter dropping two of three last weekend at home, that didn't look like a good bet. The Yankees are hoping to change that at Fenway.\n\n\"I'm not surprised we bounced back from those losses,'' Sabathia said. \"This team hasn't gotten down all year. We don't get deflated during games or after tough series and that's only continued as the season's gone on.\"\n\nA healthy -- and effective -- Chapman would help, as would a productive Aaron Judge.\n\nBut the closer and right fielder have both had their issues at Fenway, with Chapman blowing a game there earlier this season and Judge going 1-for-18 in the teams' four-game series in July.\n\n\"We can't think about what's happened before,\" Sabathia said. \"We'll find out more about this team now.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T06:49:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5098039507865906, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "06:49:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "216987", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "303569", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "score": 2}, {"id": "304989", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disabled list"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disabled_list", "score": 2}, {"id": "310475", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "score": 5}, {"id": "310584", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Aroldis Chapman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroldis_Chapman", "score": 3}, {"id": "310589", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (S)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(S)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310590", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310657", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "score": 4}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 5}, {"id": "312740", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "score": 5}, {"id": "314175", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "314181", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series", "score": 3}, {"id": "314218", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League East"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "score": 4}, {"id": "319493", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "score": 4}, {"id": "364324", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "score": 3}, {"id": "403816", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "CC Sabathia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_Sabathia", "score": 2}, {"id": "403817", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "score": 3}, {"id": "423229", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brett Gardner"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Gardner", "score": 4}, {"id": "1292074", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "score": 3}], "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/brett.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "timeCrawl": "06:49:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Two Yankees veterans not ready to give up on the division", "originalArticle": null}

Devers, 20, went into Saturday night's game with seven home runs and a .356 batting average in his first 19 games for the Red Sox. Associated Press photos/Michael Dwyer Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nNice guy? Who cares. He's a New York Yankee, and a good one at that.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox are in first place in the American League East, and the Yankees are their greatest threat. A rivalry has been reignited.\n\n\"You could tell the fans were really into it, on both sides,\" said Red Sox outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. \"The atmosphere was great.\"\n\nBradley said beating the Yankees is \"just another win\" and, technically, that is true. But victories are sweeter when they come against the Bombers.\n\n\"It's different. We all know that,\" Boston Manager John Farrell said before the series began.\n\nMitch Moreland, the veteran who came over from the Texas Rangers in the offseason, said the Yankees are simply the opponent this weekend. \"Right now, they're another team we're trying to beat ... it doesn't matter who is in the other dugout, we're going to try to go out and beat them.\"\n\nEither Moreland, 31, has not been indoctrinated into the rivalry, or he's playing it cool. I'll go with the latter.\n\nVeterans know they can't let the hyped games get to them. But what about the kids?\n\nRafael Devers, 20, is owning the Yankees. Through Friday night, he was batting .400 (6 for 15) with two home runs in four games versus New York.\n\nAndrew Benintendi, 23, has hit four home runs against the Yankees this year. On Friday, he had a key RBI single, keeping the seventh inning alive, and made a superb diving catch in left field.\n\n\"There have been some faces that have changed on both sides that are starting to get their teeth sunk into these series,\" Farrell said of the young talent for both teams.\n\nBradley, a grizzled veteran at 26, was introduced to the rivalry on Opening Day in 2013. Now he's watching Devers and Benintendi jump right in.\n\n\"Great rookies,\" Bradley said. \"They've been like 'cheat codes' on a video game. They've been able to come in and get the job done.\"\n\nCheat codes? Kids these days ... back in the early- to mid-2000s, I don't remember Trot Nixon or Gary Sheffield referring to video games.\n\nFor the uninitiated (including me), Wikipedia defines a cheat code as a code \"created by the game designers and hidden within the video game itself that will cause any type of uncommon effect that is not part of the usual game mechanics.\"\n\nUncommon. Who expected Devers, who played the first half of the season in Double-A Portland, to play such a crucial role in this rivalry so soon?\n\nThe rivalry goes back for generations, of course, and peaked in 2003 and 2004 when the teams met in the American League Championship Series, going seven games both times.\n\nBoth franchises are wealthy and can sign big-name free agents. But now, success is fueled through their farm systems.\n\nDevers and Benintendi have been Boston's counter moves to the Yankees' see-the-light youth movement. Instead of trading the Aaron Judges of his organization, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman has groomed his best prospects.\n\nNew York's roster features Judge (25 years old), Gary Sanchez (24), Luis Severino (23) and Clint Frazier (22), and soon will include Greg Bird (24), who is coming back from an ankle injury but hit two home runs in a minor-league rehab game Friday.\n\nBoston has Bradley, Benintendi, Devers, Xander Bogaerts (24), Mookie Betts (24), Christian Vazquez (26) and Eduardo Rodriguez (24).\n\nThe youth should fuel this rivalry for years. Every game will have heightened importance.\n\n\"It's big,\" Vazquez said after Friday's victory, before falling into the \"just-another-game\" mentality, saying, \"every win is big for us.\"\n\nBut if Boston can beat the Yankees - and beat them out for the American League East title - there will be extra joy in New England.\n\nA rivalry is on the way back.\n\n\"There is a different intensity in there,\" said Farrell, despite his players downplaying it.\n\n\"Make no mistake, there is a difference. You feel the difference when we play New York.\"\n\nKevin Thomas can be reached at 791-6411 or:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: ClearTheBases\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

Keep in mind, Robertson has 132 career saves, 39 of which came as New York's closer in 2014. Slumping shortstop Xander Bogaerts, mired in a 1-for-17 slump in his previous five games, broke loose with three hits and an RBI single as Boston maintained its 4 1/2-game lead in the American League East.\n\nSale, the American League Cy Young Award front-runner who is also being mentioned in the MVP talk, enters the game with a 14-4 season record and a 3.94 ERA.\n\nCUBS 7, REDS 6 Anthony Rizzo hit a grand slam in the first inning and Javier Baez scored on a wild pitch in the ninth as host Chicago overcame a late Cincinnati rally to win.\n\nFor the Friday game, the Yankees will be going with LHP Jordan Montgomery.\n\nHe was raised a Red Sox fan, mainly because his dad, Dr. Anthony Capobianco, was born and grew up in the Boston area. The sudden hot streak from Devers' fellow rookie Andrew Benintendi has only added to the fun.\n\nHe gave up two runs on four hits in six innings against the Chicago White Sox on August 4, then yielded two hits in six shutout innings against the Yankees on Friday in NY.\n\n\"These are really important games for us because the clock is ticking in a sense\", Yankees manager Joe Girardi said after his team's 7-5 win at Citi Field on Thursday night. Sure, every once in a while there's a really touching moment and we cover those as well.\n\nWhether it was Miss Texas throwing an very bad pitch, Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles doing a flip or 50 Cent failing miserably, none will be as memorable the one Jordan Leandre threw before the Red Sox game Wednesday night. Boston didn't have another losing season until 1983.\n\nNow, the rivalry is renewed.

He saw Joe Kelly blow a save, Heath Hembree allow a pair of inherited runners score, and Robby Scott walk and plunk the two batters he faced.\n\nBetween the three of them, they'd allowed four runs and recorded one out in the inning.\n\nWith the bases loaded, Reed was finally called into the game to face MVP frontrunner Aaron Judge. He needed a strikeout, and Reed got it. The hulking Yankee whiffed on a fastball for strike three.\n\n\"It was a big opportunity and A.R. handled it with poise facing a very talented hitter,\" Jackie Bradley Jr. said. \"That was big. That was a big momentum shift for us.\"\n\nA Gary Sanchez lineout ended the threat. Reed had stopped the bleeding.\n\nAfter the Sox stormed back for four runs in the bottom of the frame, Reed went back out for the eighth. The Sox desperately needed a shutdown inning and Reed was almost perfect, allowing one walk in a scoreless frame.\n\nIt was hands down his best outing in a Red Sox uniform.\n\n\"Unfortunately we sent a lot of guys to the mound, a lot of balls in play,\" Farrell said. \"Some hit batters, walks in there. But when Addison Reed came on to shut it down, and then a big eighth inning on his part, we end up right back in a big situation to close things out.\"\n\nReed's stat line of 1 2/3 scoreless with three strikeouts is solid, but a box score can do justice to impact Reed had on the momentum in this game. After a rocky weekend in New York, Reed showed Fenway Park what kind of setup man he can be.\n\nChris Mason is a Red Sox beat writer for CNHI Sports Boston.

If Mitchell, who gave up a ninth-inning homer to Curtis Granderson, hadn't forced Joe Girardi's hand, the manager could have used Betances at some point Friday as the seventh inning -- and the game -- was slipping away.\n\nBut with the big right-hander unavailable, Girardi was forced to stick with Chad Green and Tommy Kahnle.\n\nIf the Yankees are going to get to where they want to go, both will have to prove they can perform in these situations.\n\nBut against at Fenway Park on Friday, the two right-handers gave up a three-run lead in the bottom of the seventh, as the Yankees dropped the first game of the crucial series.\n\nAfter it was over, Girardi reflected on an infield hit by former Yankee Eduardo Nunez, the first batter Kahnle faced when he took over from Green.\n\n\"Nunez's infield hit really opened it up for them,\" Girardi said. \"Kahnle makes a good pitch and gets beat by a dribbler. That's out No. 2 and then he gets [Mookie] Betts for out No. 3. Sometimes things go awry. That was a big base hit [by Nunez].\"\n\nIndeed it was, as it loaded the bases with one out and was followed by Betts' sacrifice fly that cut the Yankees' lead to 6-4. Andrew Benintendi followed with an RBI single to right, -- nothing cheap about that one -- and after a walk to Hanley Ramirez, pinch-hitter Mitch Moreland delivered a two-run single to center on a third straight changeup by Kahnle.\n\n\"The first two were good,\" Kahnle said of the changeups, both of which resulted in swings and misses. \"He was on it, but they were good pitches. The third one, I obviously left up a little high, and he pushed it through the hole.\"\n\nKahnle allowed two runs in just two-thirds of an inning. It was as many runs as Kahnle had surrendered in his previous 14 appearances combined with the Yankees, spanning 11 \u00b2/\u2083 innings.\n\n\"It boils down to they were getting hits,\" Kahnle said. \"I thought I was making good pitches. Basically, it didn't turn out in my favor.\"\n\nFor Green -- who mostly has been excellent since going to the bullpen -- it was the second time in three appearances he allowed two runs.\n\n\"It's tough all the time,\" Girardi said of losing despite going to your perceived strength. \"We didn't get it done.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T08:17:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

Now there are World Series dreams coupled with the possibility of frustration.\n\n\"Everybody has to recalibrate and reset what they thought,\" YES Network play-by-play man Michael Kay said. \"Coming into the season it was, 'Just be competitive, just be in the wild-card hunt in September.' Now, it would be a disappointment if they don't win the American League East. If they get to a wild card and they don't win that game, I think it would be a disappointment. And if they don't make the wild card I think it'd be a colossal disappointment.\n\n\"You can't all of a sudden go back to what you thought in spring training because this team proved they were better than that. And the deals the Yankees made will obviously help in the future, but were made to help them right now. I think they have to get into at least a round to be somewhat satisfactory, and I think they should even win more than a round.\"\n\nThe Yankees' best chance of winning the American League East, or at least staying in the race, comes this weekend at Fenway Park with a three-game series that begins Friday night. The Yankees trail Boston by four games with Thursday's 7-5 win over the Mets, with a four-game set in The Bronx in two weeks still left on the schedule.\n\nThe Yankees had pulled ahead of Boston during a 12-day stretch in which they acquired Tommy Kahnle, David Robertson, Todd Frazier (White Sox), Jaime Garcia (Twins) and Sonny Gray (A's), but have only gone 7-8 (entering Thursday's game) since all those trades were completed.\n\nThe Yankees have dealt with a battered rotation and a beleaguered closer (Aroldis Chapman) in that time, but Kay said he believes the lineup is the biggest issue.\n\n\"It comes down to their hitting. It has disappeared,\" Kay said. \"They have got to get [Aaron] Judge back to a semblance of what [he was] in the first half. If they don't do that then somebody else has to step up and do more: [Matt] Holliday and [Starlin] Castro when they come off the DL, and the wild card in all of this is [Greg] Bird. If Bird can come back and approximate 70 percent of what he did in spring training, that would be like making a really good trade for a left-handed bat and would give the lineup more balance.\n\n\"You see [Masahiro] Tanaka and [CC] Sabathia out, and you think the starting pitching isn't good enough, and it may not be good enough to win a World Series, but it's good enough to win the East. The hitting has been the letdown and the reason they've been under a .500 team for the past 80 games.\"\n\nJudge has taken the most precipitous fall, given the massive heights he started from. But fans have remained loyal to him even as the strikeouts pile up at a record rate.\n\n\"I think they fell in love with him. If you fall in love with a girl and she gets a pimple, you still love her,\" Kay said. \"I just think that Judge is everything that a Yankees fan would want: He's got power, he's a sweet kid, he plays hard. Yankees fans haven't forgotten that he gave them a first half that no fan base had seen in the history of baseball. Just cause it's a long downturn doesn't mean they fell out of love and I don't blame them.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T07:01:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.4117647111415863, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373526", "time": "07:01:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373526", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "209299", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "216987", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borough of Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "305023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "score": 2}, {"id": "305786", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "score": 2}, {"id": "305799", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "score": 3}, {"id": "310292", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Series"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "score": 3}, {"id": "310537", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "score": 1}, {"id": "310584", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Aroldis Chapman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroldis_Chapman", "score": 2}, {"id": "310664", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Closer (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "312732", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "score": 5}, {"id": "312734", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "score": 2}, {"id": "312735", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "score": 2}, {"id": "312740", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "score": 3}, {"id": "314175", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "score": 3}, {"id": "314218", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American League East"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "score": 4}, {"id": "334416", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Todd Frazier"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Frazier", "score": 2}, {"id": "334564", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brian Cashman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cashman", "score": 4}, {"id": "342404", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "score": 3}, {"id": "369481", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "YES Network"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YES_Network", "score": 3}, {"id": "379375", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Jaime Garc\u00eda"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Garc\u00eda", "score": 2}, {"id": "403817", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "score": 3}, {"id": "406433", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sonny Gray"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics_minor_league_players#Sonny_Gray", "score": 2}, {"id": "484820", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tommy Kahnle"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Kahnle", "score": 2}, {"id": "538852", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kay_(sports_broadcaster)", "score": 3}], "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/kay.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=278", "timeCrawl": "07:01:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Michael Kay: It's fair to raise the bar on the Yankees", "originalArticle": null}

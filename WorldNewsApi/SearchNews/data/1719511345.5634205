He's sharing his picks and expert analysis only at SportsLine. See what they are at SportsLine. Why you should back Nadal While Nadal has played sparingly over the last two years due to various injuries, he is still the best clay-court tennis player of all-time. He has won 14 French Open titles and could be playing in the tournament for the last time in his career, so the fan support will be almost entirely on his side. Nadal has only lost to Zverev once on this surface, and he has never lost a match in the first round at Roland Garros. His performances so far this season have not been up to his standards, but he still has a winning record on clay at 5-3. Zverev has never won a Grand Slam and has struggled in some of the biggest matches of his career, which does not bode well heading into an emotional venue like this one. Nadal's mentality has carried him to many titles, so that is a stark contrast between these players. See who to back at SportsLine. Why you should back Zverev Nadal's numbers at this event are stunning, but he is no longer in top form at this stage of his career. He failed to make the quarterfinals in Barcelona, Madrid and Rome, winning just four total games in his 2-0 loss to Hubert Hurkacz in the Italian Open. Meanwhile, Zverev has been one of the best clay-court players for years, and he is coming off an impressive title in Rome. Zverev won five of his six matches in that event in straight sets, including a dominant serving performance against Nicolas Jarry in the final. He won a whopping 37 of 39 points behind his first serve and only dropped five total points across 11 service games. The big-serving German can take matters into his own hands on Monday, which will keep Nadal from establishing a rhythm. See who to back at SportsLine.

Spalding III, a retired United States Air Force brigadier general whose work focuses US-China relations told The Post: \"It is concerning due to the proximity to strategic locations.\n\n\"These locations can be used to set up intelligence collection sites and the owners can be influential in local politics as we have seen in the past,\" he added.\n\n\"It is alarming we do not have laws on the books that would prevent the Chinese from buying property in the US.\"\n\nUnder the guise of farming, the Chinese landowners could set up reconnaissance sights, install tracking technology, use radar and infra-red scanning to view bases or attempt to fly drones over them as ways to surveil military sites, sources told The Post.\n\nA report in the Wall Street Journal from September 2023 found Chinese intruders attempted to breach military facilities over 100 times in recent years, including sneaking onto a missile range in New Mexico and scuba divers spotted near a government rocket-launch site in Florida.\n\nThe threat the Chinese government poses to America is huge, with the FBI labelling it a \"grave threat\" and director Christopher Wray saying in April hackers have made their way into US critical infrastructure and are waiting \"for just the right moment to deal a devastating blow\" and \"physically wreak havoc.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has also warned of the threat of Chinese spies slipping over the US Southern border, disguised as among the more than 30,000 who have already been admitted this since October last year. Those spies will likely \"employ economic espionage\" and \"seek to illicitly acquire our technologies and intellectual property\" according to DHS's Homeland Threat Assessment 2024.\n\nMorgan Lerette, a former contractor for private military contractor Blackwater is sounding the alarm.\n\n\"The Chinese are, or will, use this farmland to learn more about US military capabilities, movements, and technology,\" Lerette told The Post.\n\n\"This will allow them to better understand how to transition their military from a defensive strategy to an expeditionary one,\" he said, adding they'll figure out \"how to move forces quickly for conflicts such as taking Taiwan and how and when US forces would respond to their incursions based on troop movement at these bases,\" he explained.\n\nHe added China will be watching troop movements into and out of bases in an attempt to form an idea of the patterns of behavior and movements.\n\n\"It would allow the Chinese to research what is moving and how to combat it. It's easy to identify mobilization if you know what to look for.\"\n\nLerette cited specific examples: \"Listening to GIs at a bar talking ... Local storage units being rented out near a base is an indicator troops are leaving.\n\n\"A train carrying tanks, Strykers [armored fighting vehicles], and [Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles], followed by an increased number of cargo planes landing and leaving a joint base like Lewis-McChord in Washington state, would indicate when US forces are moving,\" all of which is invaluable military knowledge.\n\nAccording to the latest analysis from the Farm Service Agency of the USDA, Chinese investors owned 349,442 acres of US farmland as of December 31, 2022.\n\nOne of the biggest investors in Texas is secretive billionaire Sun Guangxin, who has deep ties to the communist party and spent an estimated $110 million buying up land next to Laughlin Air Force Base in Val Verde County, a training ground for military pilots.\n\nAlthough no overt evidence of spying by Guangxin's companies, which use the land as a wind farm, has emerged the state's republicans have raised the alarm.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz, speaking in relation to the project, told Forbes: \"The Chinese Communist Party has demonstrated time and again they're willing to invest billions of dollars to expand their espionage capabilities and their global reach, including through land purchase schemes near military bases.\"\n\nFufeng Group, a Shandong, China-based company that specializes in flavor enhancers and sugar substitutes, purchased 300 acres of farmland 40 miles from Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, in 2022.\n\nBillionaire and Chinese Communist Party member Chen Tianqiao is the second-largest foreign owner of farmland in the US. He bought nearly 200,000 acres of farmland in Oregon in 2015 at about $430 an acre, according to the Land Report.\n\nHowever, his purchase of the acreage did not appear in government records of land ownership by foreign investors when it was first revealed in January, according to the Daily Caller.\n\nChinese holdings total under one percent of foreign-owned agricultural land in the US, per NBC, but its the proximity to critical military installations which raises concerns, critics have charged.\n\nFor example, Fort Liberty in North Carolina, for example, is surrounded by Chinese-owned farmland within a 30-mile radius.\n\nIn a move acknowledging these security risks, a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining firm was barred from owning land in Wyoming in May by the Biden administration.\n\nMineOne Partners, a firm partly backed by Chinese nationals, was told to move equipment from less than one miles from F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, saying it was a \"national security risk,\" per the Air Force Times.\n\nPotential espionage attempts by Chinese operatives have prompted the Defense Department, FBI, and other agencies to heighten their investigations on so-called \"gate-crashers\" attempting to breach US military installations.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal report, the incidents largely appear designed to test security practices, officials explained.\n\nUS-China tensions also spiked in early 2023 after a Chinese surveillance balloon flew over the mainland.\n\nThe FBI has previously warned: \"The Chinese government is engaged in a broad, diverse campaign of theft and malign influence without regard to laws or international norms that the FBI will not tolerate.\"\n\nAt Fort Wainwright, Alaska, home to the Army's 11th Airborne Division, a group of Chinese nationals attempted to push past guards, claiming they had hotel reservations on base.\n\nIn New Mexico, officials reported repeated cases of Chinese nationals taking pictures at a US Army range after straying from nearby White Sands National Park, according to WSJ.\n\nChinese nationals have also used drones to enhance their surveillance efforts. Key West, Florida, has seen repeated incidents at an intelligence center, where Chinese 'tourists' were found swimming near the military facility and snapping photos.\n\nIn 2020, three Chinese citizens were sentenced to prison after illegally entering the naval air station there, either walking around the fence or driving in and ignoring orders to turn back, the WSJ reported.\n\nMeanwhile, the border has proven an even greater threat to America's security.\n\nBy the end of the 2023 fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection officials apprehended 24,048 Chinese citizens at the border with Mexico, they revealed. That number is more than 12 times the 1,970 arrests in the previous fiscal year.\n\n\"They are a communist dictatorship no different from the [Soviet Union], except they have been integrated into the global economic system.\n\n\"This makes them even more dangerous than the USSR because of their political influence,\" Spalding added.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Cavazos", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fort Cavazos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Bragg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fort Bragg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Bragg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013United_States_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013United States relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Base_Camp_Pendleton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Gen. Robert S. Spalding III told the Post. His work focuses on U.S.-China relations.\n\n\"These locations can be used to set up intelligence collection sites and the owners can be influential in local politics as we have seen in the past,\" he said. \"It is alarming we do not have laws on the books that would prevent the Chinese from buying property in the U.S.\"\n\nUsing farming as a cover, Chinese landowners could use radar and infra-red scanning to view bases, install tracking technology, conduct reconnaissance, and attempt to fly drones over installations, the Post's sources said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in September that there were more than 100 attempts to breach military facilities by Chinese nationals in recent years, including entering a missile range in New Mexico and scuba divers who were found near a rocket-launch site in Florida.\n\nThe FBI has labeled the Chinese government a \"grave threat\" to the United States and agency Director Christopher Wray said in April that Chinese hackers have infiltrated critical U.S. infrastructure and are waiting \"for just the right moment to deal a devastating blow.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also warned of Chinese spies slipping across the U.S-Mexico border disguised as migrants to \"employ economic espionage.\" According to the DHS' Homeland Threat Assessment for 2024, these spies \"seek to illicitly acquire our technologies and intellectual property.\"\n\nMorgan Lerette, a former contractor for private military contractor Blackwater, told the Post that the Chinese \"are, or will, use this farmland to learn more about U.S. military capabilities, movements, and technology.\"\n\n\"This will allow them to better understand how to transition their military from a defensive strategy to an expeditionary one,\" Lerette said.\n\nThey will figure out \"how to move forces quickly for conflicts such as taking Taiwan and how and when U.S. forces would respond to their incursions based on troop movement at these bases,\" he said.\n\nHe added that China will be monitoring troop movements onto and off of bases in an effort to form an idea of behavior and movement patterns.\n\n\"It would allow the Chinese to research what is moving and how to combat it,\" Lerette said. \"It's easy to identify mobilization if you know what to look for.\"\n\nChinese investors owned 349,442 acres of American farmland as of Dec. 31, 2022, according to the latest analysis from the Farm Service Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nNicole Wells \u2709\n\nNicole Wells, a Newsmax general assignment reporter covers news, politics, and culture.

There's much more to it; China is ambitious yet at the same time approaching desperation. Their economy is a house of cards, their population is aging, and there may not be a China in another couple of generations unless something changes. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) apparently has its eyes on the United States, and it's not a friendly gaze they are turning our way.\n\n\"These locations can be used to set up intelligence collection sites and the owners can be influential in local politics as we have seen in the past,\" he added.\n\n\"It is alarming we do not have laws on the books that would prevent the Chinese from buying property in the US.\"\n\nUnder the guise of farming, the Chinese landowners could set up reconnaissance sights, install tracking technology, use radar and infra-red scanning to view bases or attempt to fly drones over them as ways to surveil military sites, sources told The Post.\n\nThe rest of the picture doesn't give us much cause for comfort. Chinese nationals are building illegal biolabs in America - for what? Chinese nationals are flooding into the country illegally across our open southern border - for what? China - and by China, I mean the Chinese Communist Party - is recruiting young American skulls full of mush from our elite universities - for what?\n\nSee Related: Illegal Chinese Biolab Operator Pleads Not Guilty, Claims Feds Destroyed His 'Revolutionary' Work\n\nSurge of Chinese Illegal Immigrants at Southern Border Presents National Security Threat\n\nChina Recruiting Columbia University Grad Students for 'Sustainability' Junket, but What Else?\n\nThese are not the acts of a friendly nation.\n\nConsider this: We have a bellicose nation, one that seeks to supplant the United States as the primary global superpower. They are buying land near major American military bases. They are importing thousands of young, military-aged men into our country, mostly illegally, and in this, they are aided and abetted by the Biden administration's absent border enforcement policies. We have what could very well be bioweapons laboratories in our country, operated by Chinese nationals. One doesn't need to be Sun Tzu to figure out the possible actions China may be planning. And they aren't the only threat we face.\n\nSee Related: Risk of Terror Attack in United States Shockingly High - Guess Why?\n\nChina, though, isn't Iran. Iran could hurt us. They are the world's greatest state sponsor of terrorism, and they could set up and sponsor an October 7th-style attack on the United States that could kill thousands. But China is, legitimately, a superpower. They have a navy worth the name; while they are primarily a coastal defense force, without the at-sea replenishment assets to control the Pacific, they are capable of showing up off Taiwan - or Japan. They have nuclear weapons and missiles to fire them. And they have thousands of people right here, in the United States, and now we see just how much land they have purchased, suspiciously near a bunch of sensitive U.S. military installations. They could, arguably, hurt us much worse than Iran could.\n\nChina is looking our way with a narrowed gaze, and we ignore this at our peril. Sooner or later, this will come to a head, and it won't be pretty.\n\nBut, at least these American military bases will no longer have insensitive names.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType":

Gen. Robert S. Spalding III voiced his concerns to The Post, saying, \"It is alarming we do not have laws on the books that would prevent the Chinese from buying property in the U.S.\"\n\nThe proximity of these land purchases to key military sites raises the possibility of Chinese landowners establishing surveillance operations under the pretense of farming.\n\nPotential activities could include setting up reconnaissance posts, installing tracking devices, using radar and infrared technology to monitor military activities, or even deploying drones to gather intelligence.\n\nThis issue is not just theoretical.\n\nA Wall Street Journal report from September 2023 revealed that Chinese intruders have attempted to breach U.S. military facilities over 100 times in recent years. Incidents include unauthorized entries onto a missile range in New Mexico and scuba divers being spotted near a government rocket launch site in Florida.\n\nThe FBI has labeled the Chinese government's actions as a \"grave threat,\" with Director Christopher Wray warning in April that Chinese hackers have infiltrated U.S. critical infrastructure, poised to cause significant damage at a moment's notice.\n\nHe noted that these threats have the potential to \"physically wreak havoc\" on American soil.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Cavazos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Cavazos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Base_Camp_Pendleton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Bragg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Bragg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Bragg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brigadier general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacDill_Air_Force_Base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacDill Air Force Base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nThe threats include espionage, or \"even sabotage,\" the report describes.\n\nThe Post said it identified 19 bases \"in close proximity to land bought up by Chinese entities and could be exploited by spies working for the communist nation.\"\n\nThey are in states ranging from Florida to California to North Dakota to Texas.\n\n\"It is concerning due to the proximity to strategic locations,\" warned Robert S. Spalding III, a retired United States Air Force brigadier general, in the report.\n\nThe sites, he said, could be used for intelligence collection.\n\nHe said a concern is that there are no laws preventing Chinese interests from buying up U.S. property.\n\nThe report said, \"Under the guise of farming, the Chinese landowners could set up reconnaissance sights, install tracking technology, use radar and infra-red scanning to view bases or attempt to fly drones over them as ways to surveil military sites.\"\n\nIt was less than a year ago that the Wall Street Journal documented more than 100 attempts in recent years by Chinese intruders to breach perimeters and enter military locations.\n\nThe warning of Chinese spies slipping into the nation across the porous southern border already has been issued by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThat agency's threat assessment warned the intruders could deliver \"economic espionage\" or collect tech.\n\nJoining the chorus of warnings was Morgan Lerette, who formerly worked with Blackwater, a military contractor.\n\n\"The Chinese are, or will, use this farmland to learn more about U.S. military capabilities, movements, and technology,\" he said, in the report.\n\n\"This will allow them to better understand how to transition their military from a defensive strategy to an expeditionary one,\" he said.\n\nThe report cited the Farm Service Agency of the USDA to estimate Chinese investors owned 349,442 acres of U.S. farmland as of December 31, 2022.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, recently told Forbes, \"The Chinese Communist Party has demonstrated time and again they're willing to invest billions of dollars to expand their espionage capabilities and their global reach, including through land purchase schemes near military bases.\"\n\nAnd the report said the FBI has previously warned: \"The Chinese government is engaged in a broad, diverse campaign of theft and malign influence without regard to laws or international norms that the FBI will not tolerate.\"\n\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

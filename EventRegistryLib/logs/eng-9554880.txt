Compliance Officer with the Zenith Bank.\n\nThe trial of the former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefiele, charged with abuse of office and alleged $4.5 billion and N2.8 billion fraud continued on Thursday with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) tendering bundles of documents before the court.\n\nThe bundles of documents were tendered through the third prosecution witness, a Compliance Officer with the Zenith Bank, Mr Clement Ngolu, by the EFCC counsel, Mr Rotimi Oyedepo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN).\n\nThe documents were admitted in evidence following no objections from the first defence counsel, Olalekan Ojo, a SAN, and the second defence counsel, Adeyinka Kotoye, also a SAN.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the trial judge, Rahman Oshodi, admitted the original copies of Zenith Bank account opening package, statement of account of Limelight Multidimensional Services Ltd., sent to the EFCC in evidence.\n\n\"I have read the documents dated March 2024, and I admit the original certified copy of the bundles of documents which include account opening package, statement of accounts into evidence and are marked as Exhibit A,\" Mr Oshodi said.\n\nMr Ngolu, in his evidence, said his department responded to regulators and law enforcement agencies in order to ensure that the bank activities were in line with banking policies and regulations .\n\nHe added that his department worked with agencies such as the EFCC, the Nigeria Police, the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps.\n\nThe witness said that his department in 2024 got a request from the EFCC to furnish them with statements of accounts of Limelight and two other accounts.\n\n\"The documents we sent to the EFCC was duly signed by the staff of the bank.\n\n\"The process of generating the statement was through our computer system which was in good condition.\n\n\"The documents were printed out from the company's computer which was working well and the documents were in the bank's custody,\" the witness said.\n\nThe defence, however, said they had no question for the witness.\n\nAlso, a former Director of Information Technology of CBN, John Ayoh, under further cross-examination, said he had a confrontation with Mr Emefiele because he asked him to do something wrong.\n\nThe witness who further confirmed that he was sidelined by the embattled governor added that his being sidelined made him not to have any relationship with him.\n\n\"I was not happy being unpopular with the former CBN governor but on a number of occasions, I signed contract letters to vendors.\n\n\"While I was a director with the CBN, my loyalty was to the bank and the Nigerian nation and my relationship with Emefiele was only formal and based on instructions.\n\n\"The governor and the four deputy governors of the bank alongside the directors make up the management of the CBN,\" he said.\n\nThe fourth witness, a contractor, in his evidence, testified about how he was allegedly pressurised by the central bank management to pay $600,000 for the contract which he had executed.\n\nNAN reports that Mr Ayoh, the former CBN director on information technology, had on 29 April narrated before the court how he allegedly collected $600,000 for contract gratification for Mr Emefiele.\n\nThe EFCC had on 8 April arraigned Mr Mr Emefiele on 23 counts of abuse of office, accepting gratifications, corrupt demand, receiving property fraudulently obtained and conferring corrupt advantage.\n\nAlso, his co-defendant was arraigned on three counts bordering on acceptance of gift by agents.\n\nThe defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n\nThe judge adjourned the case until 17 May for continuation of trial\n\nMr Emefiele is also standing trial in Abuja over alleged corrupt activities he was accused of perpetrating while in

He refused to do something wrong.\n\nHe said,\" I walked out of his office and said he should sack me if he wanted to\".\n\nAyoh also stated that his relationship with Emefiele was formal, as he never had any informal relationship with him.\n\nWhen asked what he meant by doing something wrong, Ayoh said that Emefiele wanted him to approach vendors and ask them for gratification, but he refused.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olugbenga_soyele@leadership.ng", "name": "Olugbenga Soyele", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information and communications technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Financial_Crimes_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic and Financial Crimes Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin_Emefiele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Godwin Emefiele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Bank_(Nigeria)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sterling Bank (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Emefiele.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554880", "eventUri": "eng-9554880", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-11-26", "textStart": 3464, "textEnd": 3481}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Judge Admits Bundle Of Documents As Exhibits", "body": "The Lagos State Special Offences Court, presided over by Justice Rahman Oshodi, has admitted a bundle of documents in the ongoing trial of the former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, charged with abuse of office, and alleged fraud to the tune of $4.5 billion and N2.8 billion respectively.\n\nBefore the decision of Justice Oshodi, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had tendered the bundle of documents through the 3rd prosecution witness, and a Compliance Officer with Zenith Bank, Mr Clement Ngolu, while being led in evidence by the counsel for the EFCC, Rotimi Oyedepo (SAN).\n\nThe documents were admitted into evidence following no objections from the 1st defence counsel, Olalekan Ojo (SAN) and the 2nd defence counsel, Adeyinka Kotoye (SAN).\n\nSpecifically, the judge admitted the original copies of Zenith Bank account opening package, statement of account of Limelight Multidimensional Services Ltd which were sent to the EFCC into evidence.\n\nAccording to the judge, \"I have read the documents dated March 2024, and I admit the original certified copy of the bundles of documents which include account opening package, statement of accounts into evidence and are marked as exhibit A.\" Oshodi said.\n\nIn his evidence before Justice Oshodi, Ngolu confirmed that his department responded to regulators and law enforcement agencies in order to ensure that the bank activities were in line with bank's policies and regulations.\n\nWhile adding that his department worked with agencies like the EFCC, Nigeria Police, ICPC and NSCDC, the witness explained that sometime in 2014, his department got a request from the EFCC to furnish it with statements of accounts of Limelight and two other accounts and the same was duly furnished the anti-graft agency.\n\nNgolu said, \"The documents we sent to the EFCC was duly signed by staff of the bank.\n\n\"The process of generating the statement was through our computer system, which was in good condition as at the time.\n\n\"The documents were printed out from the company's computer which was working well, and the documents are in the bank's custody.\"\n\nHowever, the defence said they had no question for the witness.\n\nEqually, a former Director of Information Technology of the CBN, John Ayoh, in the continuation of his cross-examination, revealed that he had a confrontation with Emefiele because he had asked him to do something wrong.\n\nThe witness who further confirmed that he was sidelined by the embattled governor on the reason that he was not popular with him, added that his being sidelined made him not to have any relationship with him.\n\nAccording to him: \"I was not happy being unpopular with the former CBN governor but on a number of occasions, I signed contract letters to vendors.\n\n\"While I was a director with the CBN, my loyalty was to the bank and the Nigerian nation and my relationship with Emefiele was only formal and based on instructions.\n\n\"The governor and the four deputy governors of the bank alongside the directors make up the management of the CBN.\"\n\nThe case has been adjourned until May 17 for the continuation of trial.", "source": {"uri": "newtelegraphng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri":

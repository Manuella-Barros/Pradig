It was a record he held until a 46-year-old O'Sullivan claimed the prize for the seventh time in 2022.\n\nAfter winning six titles, the Welshman reached one more Crucible final in 1982 when, age 49, he was beaten by Alex Higgins. Of the modern era, only O'Sullivan and Stephen Henry, with seven, have won more World Championship titles than Reardon, who is level with Steve Davis on six.\n\nHe was born in 1932 in Tredegar and began playing snooker from a young age while also working in the mines.

Unlike in the modern game, however, there was little money to be made from potting balls.\n\nCutting coal underground was the career choice, and when Welsh mines began to close the Reardon family uprooted to North Staffordshire. Ben and Ray Reardon found work at the Florence Colliery in 1956 and in the following year disaster almost struck.\n\nThe future world-beating cueman was developing a pit roadway when a \"trickle of dirt\" fell on his helmet. Sensing danger, he hurled himself down and when a 12-foot girder crashed down along with a deluge of rubble, Reardon was trapped.\n\nHe was rescued after three hours, Reardon drawing on memories of playing marbles with brother Ron - 17 years his junior - to avoid panicking.\n\nIn his 1982 autobiography, Reardon recalled: \"My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right.\"\n\nDuring war time, mother Cynthia had bought the young Ray a 4ft x 2ft billiard table for Christmas and he exhibited natural talent.\n\nOne afternoon, after attending a headmaster's funeral, Reardon ducked out of a school line and into the Tredegar Workmen's Institute Society, where he won a frame against venue manager Tommy Biggs, who had a wooden leg. Reardon was swiftly collared by his maths teacher.\n\nFrom a young age he played cue sports for money. His father frowned on this, until learning his son was winning.\n\nBy the age of 13 Reardon was representing the Institute's men's team in the Sirhowy Valley Billiards and Snooker League. He was soon champion of all Wales.\n\nAs a miner, Reardon wore white gloves similar to those of a snooker referee, but after meeting future wife Sue his career moved above ground.\n\nRay and Sue married on Easter Monday in 1959 and Reardon joined the Stoke-on-Trent police force a year later, staying for almost eight years.\n\nHe won the English amateur championship in 1964, beating John Spencer, and a year later became a father when Sue gave birth to their son Darren. Daughter Melanie followed in 1969.\n\nReardon considered staying with the police, but snooker won out. The BBC television show Pot Black was a hit, even while many watched in black and white, and Reardon defeated Spencer to win the first edition in 1969.\n\nHe lost his opener at the World Championship in the same year 25-24 to the 55-year-old Fred Davis.

Unlike in the modern game, however, there was little money to be made from potting balls.\n\nCutting coal underground was the career choice, and when Welsh mines began to close the Reardon family uprooted to North Staffordshire. Ben and Ray Reardon found work at the Florence Colliery in 1956 and in the following year disaster almost struck.\n\nThe future world-beating cueman was developing a pit roadway when a \"trickle of dirt\" fell on his helmet. Sensing danger, he hurled himself down and when a 12-foot girder crashed down along with a deluge of rubble, Reardon was trapped.\n\nHe was rescued after three hours, Reardon drawing on memories of playing marbles with brother Ron - 17 years his junior - to avoid panicking.\n\nIn his 1982 autobiography, Reardon recalled: \"My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right.\"\n\nDuring wartime, mother Cynthia had bought the young Ray a 4ft x 2ft billiard table for Christmas and he exhibited natural talent.\n\nOne afternoon, after attending a headmaster's funeral, Reardon ducked out of a school line and into the Tredegar Workmen's Institute Society, where he won a frame against venue manager Tommy Biggs, who had a wooden leg. Reardon was swiftly collared by his maths teacher.\n\nFrom a young age, he played cue sports for money. His father frowned on this, until learning his son was winning.\n\nBy the age of 13, Reardon was representing the Institute's men's team in the Sirhowy Valley Billiards and Snooker League. He was soon champion of all Wales.\n\nAs a miner, Reardon wore white gloves similar to those of a snooker referee, but after meeting future wife Sue his career moved above ground.\n\nRay and Sue married on Easter Monday in 1959 and Reardon joined the Stoke-on-Trent police force a year later, staying for almost eight years.\n\nHe won the English amateur championship in 1964, beating John Spencer, and a year later became a father when Sue gave birth to their son Darren. Daughter Melanie followed in 1969.\n\nReardon considered staying with the police, but snooker won out. The BBC television show Pot Black was a hit, even while many watched in black and white, and Reardon defeated Spencer to win the first edition in 1969.\n\nHe lost his opener at the World Championship in the same year 25-24 to the 55-year-old Fred Davis. But a year later, the 37-year-old Reardon ruled the snooker world for the first time, beating John Pulman 37-33 in the final. He said that \"nothing will ever surpass the wonder\" of the moment.\n\nReardon's first car was a Ford Prefect he labelled the 'Gutless Wonder'. Later, after upgrading, he owned the 1 PRO licence plate.\n\nManchester staged the 1974 World Championship and, come the closing session of the final against Graham Miles, Reardon introduced the outfit that would forever associate him with Bram Stoker's blood-sucking Count Dracula.\n\nStoke-based Marsden's Tailors sponsored Reardon and he emerged attired in cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket.\n\n\"Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most,\" Reardon later said.\n\nReardon for many years played exhibitions in South Africa during the apartheid era, explaining the trips by saying: \"The only world I was trying to change was the world of snooker.\"\n\nHe won four straight world titles from 1973 to 1976. Then, as defending champion, Reardon had the honour of playing on the first morning when the tournament moved to Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in 1977. He beat Patsy Fagan before falling to eventual champion Spencer.\n\nTwelve months later, Reardon reigned at the Crucible when a 25-18 victory over Perrie Mans clinched a sixth world title at the age of 45 years and 203 days.\n\nFour years later, he returned to the final but was beaten 18-15 by Alex Higgins.\n\nReardon remained competitive until the mid-1980s and retired in 1991.\n\nHis marriage to Sue ended in divorce during the twilight years of his playing career.\n\nReardon made Brixham, and later Torquay, his home, and spent many happy years as president of Churston Golf Club.\n\nIn 2004, he teamed up with Ronnie O'Sullivan in a mentoring role at the World Championship and helped to steer the Rocket to his second world title. He had received a call from O'Sullivan's imprisoned father, Ronnie snr, to encourage the union.\n\nReardon, who is survived by his second wife Carol, saw the Welsh Open trophy named in his honour in 2016 but savoured his quiet retirement in Devon, saying: \"It's nice on the golf course.\"\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Sat 20 Jul 2024, 12:58 PM Last updated: Sat 20 Jul 2024, 1:18 PM",

That record was only broken by Ronnie O'Sullivan, a player that Reardon had coached at one point, in 2022.\n\nLeading the tributes, three-time world champion Mark Williams said: \"Ray is one of the best sports people ever from Wales and the best snooker player.\n\n\"He's one of the reasons why a lot of us started playing. He put snooker on the map, alongside Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Steve Davis. Anyone playing now owes them a lot because they brought popularity to the game. He is a real inspiration.\"\n\nBy the time of snooker's boom in the mid-1980s, when the sport exploded in popularity, the Welshman was a respected elder statesman of the game. He lost to long-time rival Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins in the memorable 1982 world final at the Crucible but, that same year, became the oldest player to win a ranking event by triumphing over Jimmy White in the final of the Professional Players Tournament at the age of 50 - a record that stands until this day.\n\nHe won two non-ranking tournaments, the Welsh Professional Championship and International Masters, in 1983 and eventually retired from professional competition in 1991. He never made a maximum 147 break in tournament play but did make the even-rarer 146.\n\nReardon won the inaugural Pot Black tournament in 1969 as snooker burst on to colour televisions across the UK and he was the first ever world No 1 when the rankings were introduced during the 1976-77 season, a position he held for the next five years.\n\nHe was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1985 for services to snooker and the Welsh Open trophy was renamed the Ray Reardon Trophy in his honour from the 2017 edition of the tournament onwards.\n\nHe lived in Devon in his later life and was president of the golf club in Churston, while managing to hit a century break in his local club at the age of 91.\n\nHis impact on the sport can also be measured by those who took inspiration from him. Steve Davis, the undisputed dominant force of the 1980s, had watched Reardon play at Pontins in 1975 and incorporated aspects of the then-43-year-old's game into his own. That included a short pause before hitting the cue ball, his overall approach to the shot and mimicking the way Reardon acted around the table, thinking he was special.\n\nAhead of the 2004 World Championship, Reardon mentored O'Sullivan by giving him psychological and tactical help, mostly focusing on his safety play. 'The Rocket' would go on to win his second world title by beating Graeme Dott 18-8 in the final that year and credited Reardon in his winner's speech. The two maintained a warm relationship for the remainder of his life. \"Ray Reardon brought a side to the game I never knew existed,\" O'Sullivan would later say, while citing Reardon as one of the three most influential people in his career. \"I learnt it and now I appreciate it and use it a lot.\"\n\nReardon, born in 1932 in the coal-mining community of Tredegar in Monmouthshire, had been introduced to cue sports as an eight-year-old by his uncle and although initially focused on English billiards, his aptitude for snooker became apparent. He won the News of the World amateur title in 1949 and had a successful amateur career for many years.\n\nHe initially worked as a miner at Ty Trist Colliery, wearing white gloves while mining to protect his hands for snooker but, after being buried in a rockfall for three hours in 1960, changed career to become a policeman and moved to Stoke in England. He would turn professional in 1967, at the age of 34, and his 1969 victory in the inaugural Pot Black tournament - a series of one-frame matches broadcast by the BBC - thrust him into prominence.\n\nHe won his first of six world titles in 1970 by defeating John Pulman 37-33 in the final and began a decade of snooker dominance, which included a satisfying 27-16 win over Higgins in the 1976 final. The gentlemanly, polite and steady Reardon stood in notable contrast to the wild, untamed, unreliable style of Higgins both on and off the table, adding a fascinating personal twist to their long-time rivalry. Higgins would earn his revenge in the 1982 world final leading to one of the most iconic moments in the history of snooker when the Northern Irishman beckoned his partner and baby daughter to come and celebrate lifting the trophy alongside him.\n\nReardon made a good living on the lucrative snooker exhibition circuit throughout his life and was a mainstay on British television screens throughout the 1970s and 80s with appearances on shows such as This is Your Life, Parkinson, A Question of Sport and The Paul Daniels Magic Show. It was on the latter where he first earned the nickname 'Dracula', with the mischievous Daniels suggesting the title due to the Weslhman's dark widow's peak hairline and sharp-toothed grin. The genial Reardon leaned into the nickname which stuck with him for the rest of his career.\n\nHe married Sue, a pottery painter, in 1959 and the pair had two children together before divorcing in 1986. Reardon had left his wife in 1985 to live with Carol Covington and he told Daily Mirror reporters that that Sue had been \"fully informed\" of his eight-year affair with Covington, who he would go on to marry in 1987.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Reardon", "type": "person",

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nSnooker titan Ray Reardon has died at the age of 91.\n\nReardon dominated the snooker scene in the 1970s, bagging himself the World Snooker Championship title six times - in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1978. He's remembered not just for his game but also his playful 'Dracula' persona, which stemmed from his unique hairstyle.\n\nDespite his age, the Welsh snooker master was still active in the sport, even making headlines recently when he made a century break, becoming one of the oldest players to pull it off. His legacy includes an MBE awarded in 1985, induction into the snooker Hall of Fame in 2011 and the presentation of the Welsh Open's Ray Reardon Trophy to its winner.\n\nJohn Virgo, former player and BBC pundit, took to Twitter to share his feelings, posting: \"Sad news. Ray Reardon passed away last night, it was a honour to have known him, a true great of our game RIP.\"\n\nJimmy White, a fellow snooker legend, also tweeted to share his loss: \"Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away. A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace mate,\" reports the Mirror.\n\nMark Williams, another star of the snooker world, paid tribute: \"Ray is one of the best sports people ever from Wales and the best snooker player. He's one of the reasons why a lot of us started playing. He put snooker on the map, alongside Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Steve Davis. Anyone playing now owes them a lot because they brought popularity to the game. He is a real inspiration.\"\n\nAs we usher in 2023 ahead of the iconic Masters Snooker event, Ronnie O'Sullivan has taken time to reflect on the lasting impact of the legendary Ray Reardon. As O'Sullivan paints with admiration, \"Ray Reardon brought a side to the game I never knew existed,\" in a heartwarming tribute he shared with Eurosport.\n\n\"I learnt it and now I appreciate it and use it a lot, and when I have to.\"\n\nThe historical significance of Reardon's triumphant victory against Perrie Mans in the final round of the 1978 World Championship is carved in gold, making him the oldest world champion at the age of 45. This record stood victorious until 46 year old O'Sullivan surpassed this benchmark by clinching the esteemed prize for the seventh time in 2022.\n\nAfter his dazzling journey of securing six titles, the Welshman ventured into more championship territory by reaching the extent of the Crucible final in 1982 when he was 49. He displayed tremendous perseverance against Alex Higgins.\n\nTo this day, only O'Sullivan and Stephen Henry can boast of emulating his record of seven victories. Remarkably, Reardon stands shoulder to shoulder with Steve Davis totalling six glorious World Championship titles.\n\nReardon's story begins in 1932, in the quaint town of Tredegar. Born amid modest beginnings, his life took an interesting turn when he started playing snooker casually while juggling his job in the mines.\n\nHis innate talent didn't go unnoticed when after moving to Stoke-on-Trent, he became a police officer. Even then, he continued to nurture his love for snooker, building his reputation as one of the most skilled amateur players in the UK.\n\nIn a twist that would change his fate forever, Reardon decided to hang up his police boots and focused his career solely on professional snooker at the age of 35 in 1967. It was a decision that quickly bore fruit as he showed his true mettle by ruling the snooker spectrum throughout the 1970s.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "felix_keith@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Felix Keith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Reardon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ray Reardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_O'Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ronnie O'Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Open_(snooker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Open (snooker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Virgo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Virgo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_break", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century break"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Order of the British Empire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Higgins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Williams_(snooker_player)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Williams (snooker player)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perrie_Mans", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perrie Mans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crucible Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stoke-on-Trent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stoke-on-Trent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tredegar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tredegar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tredegar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Darts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Darts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Snooker", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Snooker", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article33287683.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_ray-reardon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749313", "eventUri": "eng-9749313", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Unlike in the modern game, however, there was little money to be made from potting balls.\n\nCutting coal underground was the career choice, and when Welsh mines began to close the Reardon family uprooted to North Staffordshire. Ben and Ray Reardon found work at the Florence Colliery in 1956 and in the following year disaster almost struck.\n\nThe future world-beating cueman was developing a pit roadway when a \"trickle of dirt\" fell on his helmet. Sensing danger, he hurled himself down and when a 12-foot girder crashed down along with a deluge of rubble, Reardon was trapped.\n\nHe was rescued after three hours, Reardon drawing on memories of playing marbles with brother Ron - 17 years his junior - to avoid panicking.\n\nIn his 1982 autobiography, Reardon recalled: \"My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right.\"\n\nDuring war time, mother Cynthia had bought the young Ray a 4ft x 2ft billiard table for Christmas and he exhibited natural talent.\n\nOne afternoon, after attending a headmaster's funeral, Reardon ducked out of a school line and into the Tredegar Workmen's Institute Society, where he won a frame against venue manager Tommy Biggs, who had a wooden leg. Reardon was swiftly collared by his maths teacher.\n\nRay Reardon beat South Africa\u00b4s Perrie Mans (left) to win the world title in 1978 (PA).\n\nFrom a young age he played cue sports for money. His father frowned on this, until learning his son was winning.\n\nBy the age of 13 Reardon was representing the Institute's men's team in the Sirhowy Valley Billiards and Snooker League. He was soon champion of all Wales.\n\nAs a miner, Reardon wore white gloves similar to those of a snooker referee, but after meeting future wife Sue his career moved above ground.\n\nRay and Sue married on Easter Monday in 1959 and Reardon joined the Stoke-on-Trent police force a year later, staying for almost eight years.\n\nHe won the English amateur championship in 1964, beating John Spencer, and a year later became a father when Sue gave birth to their son Darren. Daughter Melanie followed in 1969.\n\nReardon considered staying with the police, but snooker won out. The BBC television show Pot Black was a hit, even while many watched in black and white, and Reardon defeated Spencer to win the first edition in 1969.\n\nHe lost his opener at the World Championship in the same year 25-24 to the 55-year-old Fred Davis. But a year later, the 37-year-old Reardon ruled the snooker world for the first time, beating John Pulman 37-33 in the final. He said that \"nothing will ever surpass the wonder\" of the moment.\n\nReardon's first car was a Ford Prefect he labelled the 'Gutless Wonder'. Later, after upgrading, he owned the 1 PRO licence plate.\n\nManchester staged the 1974 World Championship and, come the closing session of the final against Graham Miles, Reardon introduced the outfit that would forever associate him with Bram Stoker's blood-sucking Count Dracula.\n\nStoke-based Marsden's Tailors sponsored Reardon and he emerged attired in cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket.\n\n\"Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most,\" Reardon later said.\n\nReardon for many years played exhibitions in South Africa during the apartheid era, explaining the trips by saying: \"The only world I was trying to change was the world of snooker.\"\n\nRay Reardon served as a mentor for Ronnie O\u00b4Sullivan at the 2004 World Championship (Gareth Copley/PA).\n\nHe won four straight world titles from 1973 to 1976. Then, as defending champion, Reardon had the honour of playing on the first morning when the tournament moved to Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in 1977.

He's one of the reasons why a lot of us started playing.\n\n\"He put snooker on the map, alongside Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Steve Davis. Anyone playing now owes them a lot because they brought popularity to the game. He is a real inspiration.\"\n\nWhite paid his own tribute in a post on X which read: \"Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away. A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace, mate.\"\n\nBorn in Tredegar in 1932, Reardon took up snooker and billiards as a youngster and, having followed his father down the pit at Ty Trist Colliery, proved so adept at the former that he won the Welsh Amateur Championship every year from 1950 to 1955.\n\nHe swapped the mines for a career with the police but at the age of 35, and after beating John Spencer to lift the English Amateur title in 1964, he turned professional.\n\nReardon's first world championship campaign ended in a 25-24 quarter-final defeat by Fred Davis in 1969, but he won the title for the first time a year later and repeated the feat in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1978, the last of his wins coming at the Crucible after the tournament's move to the Sheffield venue 12 months earlier.\n\nThat win over South Africa's Perrie Mans established the then 45-year-old as the oldest man to claim the world crown, a record surpassed by Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2022.\n\nReardon reached one more world final in 1982, when he was beaten by Higgins, but won 16 other professional tournaments during a career which saw him crowned as the sport's first number one when rankings were introduced in 1975.\n\nHe retired in 1991, but continued to play into his nineties and compiled a century break in November last year.\n\nReardon's death prompted an outpouring of affection for a man whose warmth and humour helped to make him a household name.\n\nShaun Murphy, world champion in 2005, said on X: \"What a man you were Ray. An absolute animal on the table, and a total gentleman off it. It was an honour to spend time with you whether we played snooker or golf - I'll treasure every minute. Rest in peace.\"\n\nFormer player and current TV presenter Neal Foulds posted: \"Awfully sad news that Ray Reardon has passed away. A giant of our sport. Thanks for the memories Ray. Rest in peace.\"\n\nTV personality Piers Morgan said: \"Sad news. Brilliant player, and such a classy gentleman.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nWorld Snooker has announced the passing of six-time world champion Ray Reardon at the age of 91. This comes just months after the snooker legend became one of the oldest players in history to hit a century break.\n\nThe World Snooker Tour's official website released a statement saying: \"Ray Reardon, widely regarded as one of the greatest snooker players ever and a six-time world champion, has died at the age of 91.\"\n\nHis wife Carol confirmed his death. Known affectionately as 'the Gentleman', Reardon dominated the snooker scene in the 1970s, winning six World Snooker Championship titles.\n\nHe was also the first snooker player to be ranked as World No. 1 when the system was introduced in 1976.\n\nSpeaking to Torbay Today last year, the Welsh snooker legend said: \"Absolutely, a 100 break, couldn't believe it. I always wanted to beat my age... got a couple of 70s some time back and was happy with that.\", reports the Daily Star.\n\n\"Then suddenly I did it ... 100. Could not believe it! There cannot be many, if any, people in their 90s that have had a 100 break, I must be the only one in the world. Sadly, there is nobody left from my snooker circuit who is still playing, come to think of it.\"\n\nFellow snooker player Jimmy White expressed his sorrow on X, saying: \"Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away. A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace mate.\"\".\n\nDuring his playing days, Reardon was affectionately known as Dracula, thanks to his distinctive widow's peak and sharp-toothed smile. Until his passing, he was just as likely to be seen with a golf club as a snooker cue, serving as the president of Churston Golf Club in Brixham, Devon.\n\nHe took on the role in 2001, following a stint as the club captain.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_wollaston@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Steve Wollaston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Reardon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ray Reardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_break", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Century break"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torbay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torbay"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Torbay"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_White", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dracula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_stick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cue stick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Country club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brixham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brixham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brixham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Devon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Darts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Darts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Snooker", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Snooker", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/national-sport/article29580227.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ray-Reardon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749313", "eventUri": "eng-9749313", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Unlike in the modern game, however, there was little money to be made from potting balls.\n\nCutting coal underground was the career choice, and when Welsh mines began to close the Reardon family uprooted to North Staffordshire. Ben and Ray Reardon found work at the Florence Colliery in 1956 and in the following year disaster almost struck.\n\nThe future world-beating cueman was developing a pit roadway when a \"trickle of dirt\" fell on his helmet. Sensing danger, he hurled himself down and when a 12-foot girder crashed down along with a deluge of rubble, Reardon was trapped.\n\nHe was rescued after three hours, Reardon drawing on memories of playing marbles with brother Ron - 17 years his junior - to avoid panicking.\n\nIn his 1982 autobiography, Reardon recalled: \"My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right.\"\n\nDuring war time, mother Cynthia had bought the young Ray a 4ft x 2ft billiard table for Christmas and he exhibited natural talent.\n\nOne afternoon, after attending a headmaster's funeral, Reardon ducked out of a school line and into the Tredegar Workmen's Institute Society, where he won a frame against venue manager Tommy Biggs, who had a wooden leg. Reardon was swiftly collared by his maths teacher.\n\nFrom a young age he played cue sports for money. His father frowned on this, until learning his son was winning.\n\nBy the age of 13 Reardon was representing the Institute's men's team in the Sirhowy Valley Billiards and Snooker League. He was soon champion of all Wales.\n\nAs a miner, Reardon wore white gloves similar to those of a snooker referee, but after meeting future wife Sue his career moved above ground.\n\nRay and Sue married on Easter Monday in 1959 and Reardon joined the Stoke-on-Trent police force a year later, staying for almost eight years.\n\nHe won the English amateur championship in 1964, beating John Spencer, and a year later became a father when Sue gave birth to their son Darren. Daughter Melanie followed in 1969.\n\nReardon considered staying with the police, but snooker won out. The BBC television show Pot Black was a hit, even while many watched in black and white, and Reardon defeated Spencer to win the first edition in 1969.\n\nHe lost his opener at the World Championship in the same year 25-24 to the 55-year-old Fred Davis. But a year later, the 37-year-old Reardon ruled the snooker world for the first time, beating John Pulman 37-33 in the final. He said that \"nothing will ever surpass the wonder\" of the moment.\n\nReardon's first car was a Ford Prefect he labelled the 'Gutless Wonder'. Later, after upgrading, he owned the 1 PRO licence plate.\n\nManchester staged the 1974 World Championship and, come the closing session of the final against Graham Miles, Reardon introduced the outfit that would forever associate him with Bram Stoker's blood-sucking Count Dracula.\n\nStoke-based Marsden's Tailors sponsored Reardon and he emerged attired in cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket.\n\n\"Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most,\" Reardon later said.\n\nReardon for many years played exhibitions in South Africa during the apartheid era, explaining the trips by saying: \"The only world I was trying to change was the world of snooker.\"\n\nHe won four straight world titles from 1973 to 1976. Then, as defending champion, Reardon had the honour of playing on the first morning when the tournament moved to Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in 1977. He beat Patsy Fagan before falling to eventual champion Spencer.\n\nTwelve months later and Reardon reigned at the Crucible when a 25-18 victory over Perrie Mans clinched a sixth world title at the age of 45 years and 203 days.\n\nFour years later he returned to the final but was beaten 18-15 by Alex Higgins.\n\nReardon remained competitive until the mid-1980s and retired in 1991.\n\nHis marriage to Sue ended in divorce during the twilight years of his playing career.\n\nReardon made Brixham, and later Torquay, his home, and spent many happy years as president of Churston Golf Club.\n\nIn 2004 he teamed up with Ronnie O'Sullivan in a mentoring role at the World Championship and helped to steer the Rocket to his second world title. He had received a call from O'Sullivan's imprisoned father, Ronnie snr, to encourage the union.\n\nReardon, who is survived by his second wife Carol, saw the Welsh Open trophy named in his honour in 2016 but savoured his quiet retirement in Devon, saying: \"It's nice on the golf course.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [],

That record was only broken by Ronnie O'Sullivan, a player that Reardon had coached at one point, in 2022.\n\nLeading the tributes, three-time world champion Mark Williams said: \"Ray is one of the best sports people ever from Wales and the best snooker player.\n\n\"He's one of the reasons why a lot of us started playing. He put snooker on the map, alongside Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Steve Davis. Anyone playing now owes them a lot because they brought popularity to the game. He is a real inspiration.\"\n\nBy the time of snooker's boom in the mid-1980s, when the sport exploded in popularity, the Welshman was a respected elder statesman of the game. He lost to long-time rival Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins in the memorable 1982 world final at the Crucible but, that same year, became the oldest player to win a ranking event by triumphing over Jimmy White in the final of the Professional Players Tournament at the age of 50 - a record that stands until this day.\n\nHe won two non-ranking tournaments, the Welsh Professional Championship and International Masters, in 1983 and eventually retired from professional competition in 1991. He never made a maximum 147 break in tournament play but did make the even-rarer 146.\n\nReardon won the inaugural Pot Black tournament in 1969 as snooker burst on to colour televisions across the UK and he was the first ever world No 1 when the rankings were introduced during the 1976-77 season, a position he held for the next five years.\n\nHe was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1985 for services to snooker and the Welsh Open trophy was renamed the Ray Reardon Trophy in his honour from the 2017 edition of the tournament onwards.\n\nHe lived in Devon in his later life and was president of the golf club in Churston, while managing to hit a century break in his local club at the age of 91.\n\nHis impact on the sport can also be measured by those who took inspiration from him. Steve Davis, the undisputed dominant force of the 1980s, had watched Reardon play at Pontins in 1975 and incorporated aspects of the then-43-year-old's game into his own. That included a short pause before hitting the cue ball, his overall approach to the shot and mimicking the way Reardon acted around the table, thinking he was special.\n\nAhead of the 2004 World Championship, Reardon mentored O'Sullivan by giving him psychological and tactical help, mostly focusing on his safety play. 'The Rocket' would go on to win his second world title by beating Graeme Dott 18-8 in the final that year and credited Reardon in his winner's speech. The two maintained a warm relationship for the remainder of his life. \"Ray Reardon brought a side to the game I never knew existed,\" O'Sullivan would later say, while citing Reardon as one of the three most influential people in his career. \"I learnt it and now I appreciate it and use it a lot.\"\n\nReardon, born in 1932 in the coal-mining community of Tredegar in Monmouthshire, had been introduced to cue sports as an eight-year-old by his uncle and although initially focused on English billiards, his aptitude for snooker became apparent. He won the News of the World amateur title in 1949 and had a successful amateur career for many years.\n\nHe initially worked as a miner at Ty Trist Colliery, wearing white gloves while mining to protect his hands for snooker but, after being buried in a rockfall for three hours in 1960, changed career to become a policeman and moved to Stoke in England. He would turn professional in 1967, at the age of 34, and his 1969 victory in the inaugural Pot Black tournament - a series of one-frame matches broadcast by the BBC - thrust him into prominence.\n\nHe won his first of six world titles in 1970 by defeating John Pulman 37-33 in the final and began a decade of snooker dominance, which included a satisfying 27-16 win over Higgins in the 1976 final. The gentlemanly, polite and steady Reardon stood in notable contrast to the wild, untamed, unreliable style of Higgins both on and off the table, adding a fascinating personal twist to their long-time rivalry. Higgins would earn his revenge in the 1982 world final leading to one of the most iconic moments in the history of snooker when the Northern Irishman beckoned his partner and baby daughter to come and celebrate lifting the trophy alongside him.\n\nReardon made a good living on the lucrative snooker exhibition circuit throughout his life and was a mainstay on British television screens throughout the 1970s and 80s with appearances on shows such as This is Your Life, Parkinson, A Question of Sport and The Paul Daniels Magic Show. It was on the latter where he first earned the nickname 'Dracula', with the mischievous Daniels suggesting the title due to the Weslhman's dark widow's peak hairline and sharp-toothed grin. The genial Reardon leaned into the nickname which stuck with him for the rest of his career.\n\nHe married Sue, a pottery painter, in 1959 and the pair had two children together before divorcing in 1986. Reardon had left his wife in 1985 to live with Carol Covington and he told Daily Mirror reporters that that Sue had been \"fully informed\" of his eight-year affair with Covington, who he would go on to marry in 1987.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Reardon", "type":

I have this ability to pot balls and this gift that I find all ball sports easy really but I still feel like I've needed help and guidance along the way to make me better, better and better. And once I'm shown what to do I can only incorporate that into my game.\n\n\"The word was 'I'm going to make you into an impregnable player' and I didn't even know what 'impregnable' meant. I thought, alright, well, if that's what you think I need then we'll go along those lines. And then it was just slowly after working in some practice sessions I thought we were just going to pot balls.\"\n\nReardon won five ranking events and was a pioneer of the game alongside the likes of Steve Davis and Alex Higgins.\n\nAmong the tributes was a message from former player and rival Jimmy White, which read: \"Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away. A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace mate.\"\n\nHis countryman Mark Williams, a three-time world champion, said: \"Ray is one of the best sports people ever from Wales and the best snooker player.\n\n\"He's one of the reasons why a lot of us started playing. He put snooker on the map, alongside Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Steve Davis. Anyone playing now owes them a lot because they brought popularity to the game. He is a real inspiration.\"\n\nAnother ex-player and BBC commentator John Virgo wrote: \"Sad news.

Unlike in the modern game, however, there was little money to be made from potting balls.\n\nCutting coal underground was the career choice, and when Welsh mines began to close the Reardon family uprooted to North Staffordshire. Ben and Ray Reardon found work at the Florence Colliery in 1956 and in the following year disaster almost struck.\n\nThe future world-beating cueman was developing a pit roadway when a \"trickle of dirt\" fell on his helmet. Sensing danger, he hurled himself down and when a 12-foot girder crashed down along with a deluge of rubble, Reardon was trapped.\n\nHe was rescued after three hours, Reardon drawing on memories of playing marbles with brother Ron - 17 years his junior - to avoid panicking.\n\nIn his 1982 autobiography, Reardon recalled: \"My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right.\"\n\nDuring war time, mother Cynthia had bought the young Ray a 4ft x 2ft billiard table for Christmas and he exhibited natural talent.\n\nOne afternoon, after attending a headmaster's funeral, Reardon ducked out of a school line and into the Tredegar Workmen's Institute Society, where he won a frame against venue manager Tommy Biggs, who had a wooden leg. Reardon was swiftly collared by his maths teacher.\n\nFrom a young age he played cue sports for money. His father frowned on this, until learning his son was winning.\n\nBy the age of 13 Reardon was representing the Institute's men's team in the Sirhowy Valley Billiards and Snooker League. He was soon champion of all Wales.\n\nAs a miner, Reardon wore white gloves similar to those of a snooker referee, but after meeting future wife Sue his career moved above ground.\n\nRay and Sue married on Easter Monday in 1959 and Reardon joined the Stoke-on-Trent police force a year later, staying for almost eight years.\n\nHe won the English amateur championship in 1964, beating John Spencer, and a year later became a father when Sue gave birth to their son Darren. Daughter Melanie followed in 1969.\n\nReardon considered staying with the police, but snooker won out. The BBC television show Pot Black was a hit, even while many watched in black and white, and Reardon defeated Spencer to win the first edition in 1969.\n\nHe lost his opener at the World Championship in the same year 25-24 to the 55-year-old Fred Davis. But a year later, the 37-year-old Reardon ruled the snooker world for the first time, beating John Pulman 37-33 in the final. He said that \"nothing will ever surpass the wonder\" of the moment.\n\nReardon's first car was a Ford Prefect he labelled the 'Gutless Wonder'. Later, after upgrading, he owned the 1 PRO licence plate.\n\nManchester staged the 1974 World Championship and, come the closing session of the final against Graham Miles, Reardon introduced the outfit that would forever associate him with Bram Stoker's blood-sucking Count Dracula.\n\nStoke-based Marsden's Tailors sponsored Reardon and he emerged attired in cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket.\n\n\"Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most,\" Reardon later said.\n\nReardon for many years played exhibitions in South Africa during the apartheid era, explaining the trips by saying: \"The only world I was trying to change was the world of snooker.\"\n\nHe won four straight world titles from 1973 to 1976. Then, as defending champion, Reardon had the honour of playing on the first morning when the tournament moved to Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in 1977. He beat Patsy Fagan before falling to eventual champion Spencer.\n\nTwelve months later and Reardon reigned at the Crucible when a 25-18 victory over Perrie Mans clinched a sixth world title at the age of 45 years and 203 days.\n\nFour years later he returned to the final but was beaten 18-15 by Alex Higgins.\n\nReardon remained competitive until the mid-1980s and retired in 1991.\n\nHis marriage to Sue ended in divorce during the twilight years of his playing career.\n\nReardon made Brixham, and later Torquay, his home, and spent many happy years as president of Churston Golf Club.\n\nIn 2004 he teamed up with Ronnie O'Sullivan in a mentoring role at the World Championship and helped to steer the Rocket to his second world title. He had received a call from O'Sullivan's imprisoned father, Ronnie snr, to encourage the union.\n\nReardon, who is survived by his second wife Carol, saw the Welsh Open trophy named in his honour in 2016 but savoured his quiet retirement in Devon, saying: \"It's nice on the golf course.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace, mate.\"\n\nBorn in Tredegar in 1932, Reardon took up snooker and billiards as a youngster and, having followed his father down the pit at Ty Trist Colliery, proved so adept at the former that he won the Welsh Amateur Championship every year from 1950 to 1955.\n\nHe swapped the mines for a career with the police but at the age of 35, and after beating John Spencer to lift the English Amateur title in 1964, he turned professional.\n\nReardon's first world championship campaign ended in a 25-24 quarter-final defeat by Fred Davis in 1969, but he won the title for the first time a year later and repeated the feat in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1978, the last of his wins coming at the Crucible after the tournament's move to the Sheffield venue 12 months earlier.\n\nThat win over South Africa's Perrie Mans established the then 45-year-old as the oldest man to claim the world crown, a record surpassed by Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2022.\n\nReardon reached one more world final in 1982, when he was beaten by Higgins, but won 16 other professional tournaments during a career which saw him crowned as the sport's first number one when rankings were introduced in 1975.\n\nHe retired in 1991, but continued to play into his nineties and compiled a century break in November last year.\n\nReardon's death prompted an outpouring of affection for a man whose warmth and humour helped to make him a household name.\n\nDennis Taylor, winner of the 1985 world championship, said on X: \"So sad to hear of the passing of the great Ray Reardon. Would always be in my top 8 of all time.\n\n\"Had the pleasure of traveling around the world with a true gentleman. Condolences to all his family. RIP Ray.\"\n\nShaun Murphy, world champion in 2005, said: \"What a man you were Ray. An absolute animal on the table, and a total gentleman off it. It was an honour to spend time with you whether we played snooker or golf - I'll treasure every minute.

I have this ability to pot balls and this gift that I find all ball sports easy really but I still feel like I've needed help and guidance along the way to make me better, better and better. And once I'm shown what to do I can only incorporate that into my game.\n\n\"The word was 'I'm going to make you into an impregnable player' and I didn't even know what 'impregnable' meant. I thought, alright, well, if that's what you think I need then we'll go along those lines. And then it was just slowly after working in some practice sessions I thought we were just going to pot balls.\"\n\nThe tributes that have poured in following the announcement of his death help sum up what he meant to the game of snooker.\n\nJimmy White, who was one of his rivals during his playing days, said: \"Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away. A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace mate.\"\n\nHis countryman Mark Williams, a three-time world champion, said: \"Ray is one of the best sports people ever from Wales and the best snooker player.\n\n\"He's one of the reasons why a lot of us started playing.

The popular Welshman, nicknamed \"Dracula\" because of his distinctive widow's peak hairstyle, died on Friday night after a battle with cancer, his wife Carol has confirmed.\n\nA former coal miner and police officer, Reardon was at the forefront of the game's rise to popularity as a televised sport during the 1970s and is credited with influencing the next generation of superstars.\n\nCompatriot and three-time world champion Mark Williams told the World Snooker Tour's official website: \"Ray is one of the best sports people ever from Wales and the best snooker player. He's one of the reasons why a lot of us started playing.\n\nRead more:Three North Wales chip shops named on list of best 23 in the UK\n\nRead more:Bizarre patterns on remote North Wales hill leave people baffled amid raft of conspiracy theories\n\n\"He put snooker on the map, alongside Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Steve Davis. Anyone playing now owes them a lot because they brought popularity to the game. He is a real inspiration.\"\n\nWhite paid his own tribute in a post on X which read: \"Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away. A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace, mate.\"\n\nBorn in Tredegar in 1932, Reardon took up snooker and billiards as a youngster and, having followed his father down the pit at Ty Trist Colliery, proved so adept at the former that he won the Welsh Amateur Championship every year from 1950 to 1955.\n\nHe swapped the mines for a career with the police but at the age of 35, and after beating John Spencer to lift the English Amateur title in 1964, he turned professional.\n\nReardon's first world championship campaign ended in a 25-24 quarter-final defeat by Fred Davis in 1969, but he won the title for the first time a year later and repeated the feat in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1978, the last of his wins coming at the Crucible after the tournament's move to the Sheffield venue 12 months earlier.\n\nThat win over South Africa's Perrie Mans established the then 45-year-old as the oldest man to claim the world crown, a record surpassed by Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2022.\n\nReardon reached one more world final in 1982, when he was beaten by Higgins, but won 16 other professional tournaments during a career which saw him crowned as the sport's first number one when rankings were introduced in 1975.\n\nHe retired in 1991, but continued to play into his nineties and compiled a century break in November last year.\n\nReardon's death prompted an outpouring of affection for a man whose warmth and humour helped to make him a household name.\n\nDennis Taylor, winner of the 1985 world championship, said on X: \"So sad to hear of the passing of the great Ray Reardon. Would always be in my top 8 of all time.\n\n\"Had the pleasure of traveling around the world with a true gentleman. Condolences to all his family. RIP Ray.\"\n\nShaun Murphy, world champion in 2005, said: \"What a man you were Ray. An absolute animal on the table, and a total gentleman off it. It was an honour to spend time with you whether we played snooker or golf - I'll treasure every minute. Rest in peace.\"\n\nFormer player and current TV presenter Neal Foulds posted: \"Awfully sad news that Ray Reardon has passed away. A giant of our sport. Thanks for the memories Ray. Rest in peace.\"\n\nTV personality Piers Morgan said: \"Sad news. Brilliant player, and such a classy gentleman.

Unlike in the modern game, however, there was little money to be made from potting balls.\n\nCutting coal underground was the career choice, and when Welsh mines began to close the Reardon family uprooted to North Staffordshire. Ben and Ray Reardon found work at the Florence Colliery in 1956 and in the following year disaster almost struck.\n\nThe future world-beating cueman was developing a pit roadway when a \"trickle of dirt\" fell on his helmet. Sensing danger, he hurled himself down and when a 12-foot girder crashed down along with a deluge of rubble, Reardon was trapped.\n\nHe was rescued after three hours, Reardon drawing on memories of playing marbles with brother Ron - 17 years his junior - to avoid panicking.\n\nIn his 1982 autobiography, Reardon recalled: \"My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right.\"\n\nDuring war time, mother Cynthia had bought the young Ray a 4ft x 2ft billiard table for Christmas and he exhibited natural talent.\n\nOne afternoon, after attending a headmaster's funeral, Reardon ducked out of a school line and into the Tredegar Workmen's Institute Society, where he won a frame against venue manager Tommy Biggs, who had a wooden leg. Reardon was swiftly collared by his maths teacher.\n\nBy the age of 13 Reardon was representing the Institute's men's team in the Sirhowy Valley Billiards and Snooker League. He was soon champion of all Wales.\n\nAs a miner, Reardon wore white gloves similar to those of a snooker referee, but after meeting future wife Sue his career moved above ground.\n\nRay and Sue married on Easter Monday in 1959 and Reardon joined the Stoke-on-Trent police force a year later, staying for almost eight years.\n\nHe won the English amateur championship in 1964, beating John Spencer, and a year later became a father when Sue gave birth to their son Darren. Daughter Melanie followed in 1969.\n\nReardon considered staying with the police, but snooker won out. The BBC television show Pot Black was a hit, even while many watched in black and white, and Reardon defeated Spencer to win the first edition in 1969.\n\nHe lost his opener at the World Championship in the same year 25-24 to the 55-year-old Fred Davis. But a year later, the 37-year-old Reardon ruled the snooker world for the first time, beating John Pulman 37-33 in the final. He said that \"nothing will ever surpass the wonder\" of the moment.\n\nReardon's first car was a Ford Prefect he labelled the 'Gutless Wonder'. Later, after upgrading, he owned the 1 PRO licence plate.\n\nManchester staged the 1974 World Championship and, come the closing session of the final against Graham Miles, Reardon introduced the outfit that would forever associate him with Bram Stoker's blood-sucking Count Dracula.\n\nStoke-based Marsden's Tailors sponsored Reardon and he emerged attired in cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket.\n\n\"Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most,\" Reardon later said.\n\nReardon for many years played exhibitions in South Africa during the apartheid era, explaining the trips by saying: \"The only world I was trying to change was the world of snooker.\"\n\nTwelve months later and Reardon reigned at the Crucible when a 25-18 victory over Perrie Mans clinched a sixth world title at the age of 45 years and 203 days.\n\nFour years later he returned to the final but was beaten 18-15 by Alex Higgins.\n\nReardon remained competitive until the mid-1980s and retired in 1991.\n\nHis marriage to Sue ended in divorce during the twilight years of his playing career.\n\nReardon made Brixham, and later Torquay, his home, and spent many happy years as president of Churston Golf Club.\n\nIn 2004 he teamed up with Ronnie O'Sullivan in a mentoring role at the World Championship and helped to steer the Rocket to his second world title. He had received a call from O'Sullivan's imprisoned father, Ronnie snr, to encourage the union.\n\nReardon, who is survived by his second wife Carol, saw the Welsh Open trophy named in his honour in 2016 but savoured his quiet retirement in Devon, saying: \"It's nice on the golf course.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors":

The former Florence Colliery miner, who lived in Stoke-on-Trent for several years is rightly considered one of the sport's true icons with tributes already pouring in.\n\nHe was dominant in the 1970s winning scores of world titles. Now the snooker world is in mourning following his death.\n\nAlthough born in Wales, his time in the Potteries will leave sports fans in North Staffordshire fondly regarding him as an honorary Stokie. Ray moved to the city in 1955 and worked at Florence Colliery.\n\nREAD: Man missing since May thought to be 'sleeping rough in Stoke-on-Trent' | Officers have appealed for help in finding the missing 41-year-old\n\nREAD: Mum's fury after train passenger 'tells crying toddler son to shut the f**k up' | An investigation has been launched\n\nIt was in 1957 when a mining accident also claimed his life. He went on to pound the beat around Hanley as a police officer.\n\nHowever he turned professional in sport and became arguably the greatest snooker player on the planet. The Mirror reports today how winning the World Snooker Championship title in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1978 and holds the honour as the first person to be named world No.1.\n\nHe was one of the sport's most popular and charismatic players, known as 'Dracula' due to his distinctive hairstyle. His victory over Perrie Mans in the 1978 World Championship final made him the oldest world champion at age 45. It was a record he held until a 46-year-old Ronnie O'Sullivan claimed the prize for the seventh time in 2022.\n\nAfter winning six titles, the Welshman reached one more Crucible final in 1982 when, age 49, he was beaten by Alex Higgins. Of the modern era, only O'Sullivan and Stephen Hendry, with seven, have won more World Championship titles than Reardon, who is level with Steve Davis on six.\n\nRay was awarded an MBE in 1985, was inducted into the snooker Hall of Fame in 2011, and his name will live on as the winner of the Welsh Open is presented with the Ray Reardon Trophy. He eventually moved away from the Potteries, having lived in Weston Coyney and Werrington, and went to Devon.\n\nBut he was still a regular visitor to the Potteries and would pop up in pages of The Sentinel when he'd return to visit pals and remain a mentor for many aspiring snooker players. He was also honorary president of Goldenhill Golf Club.\n\nToday tributes have been pouring in for Ray. Legendary player Jimmy White tweeted: \"Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away. A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace mate.\"\n\nSnooker star Mark Williams said: \"Ray is one of the best sports people ever from Wales and the best snooker player. He's one of the reasons why a lot of us started playing. He put snooker on the map, alongside Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Steve Davis. Anyone playing now owes them a lot because they brought popularity to the game. He is a real inspiration.\"\n\nFormer player and BBC commentator John Virgo tweeted: \"Sad news. Ray Reardon passed away last night, it was a honour to have known him, a true great of our game RIP.\"\n\nSpeaking at the start of 2023, ahead of the Masters Snooker event, Ronnie O'Sullivan explained the enduring legacy of Reardon. \"Ray Reardon brought a side to the game I never knew existed,\" O'Sullivan told Eurosport. \"I learnt it and now I appreciate it and use it a lot, and when I have

The couple reportedly met in 1977, when Ray was still married to his first wife\n\nThat year, Ray missed out on the world title championship for the first time in five years - but secured his title again the following year.\n\nHere FEMAIL delves into the forgotten scandal that tainted the Welshman's image as a family man.\n\nNear death experience and first wife's support\n\nWhen Ray was just 24 years old, the snooker legend, from Tredegar, was involved in a near-fatal mining accident.\n\nThe sporting star had left Georgetown Secondary School at 14 and briefly worked as an apprentice motor mechanic.\n\nHe then followed his father Ben down the mines in Wales before relocating to North Staffordshire in 1956 to work at the Florence Colliery.\n\nThe following year, future world-beating cueman was developing a pit roadway when a 'trickle of dirt' fell on his helmet.\n\nSensing danger, he hurled himself down and when a 12-foot girder crashed down along with a deluge of rubble, Reardon was trapped.\n\nPictured: Ray and Sue Reardon pose with his OBE outside Buckingham Palace in 1985, the same year the snooker star left his wife for Carol Covington\n\nHe was rescued after three hours, Reardon drawing on memories of playing marbles with brother Ron - 17 years his junior - to avoid panicking.\n\nIn his 1982 autobiography, Reardon recalled: 'My ordeal had left me looking and feeling a bit like a dirty dishcloth and when the blood started to circulate in my numb legs it had me screaming in pain for a moment or so, but they gave me sips of water and soon I was all right.'\n\nAccording to Press Association, Ray met his first wife Sue not long later and the pottery painter reportedly urged him to give up his life-threatening job.\n\nTwo years after the accident at Florence Colliery, Ray and Sue married on Easter Monday and the snooker legend joined Stoke-on-Trent's police force in 1960.\n\nIn 1965, the couple welcomed their son Darren - just one year after Ray had won the English amateur championship.\n\nWith his wife's encouragement, Ray began pursuing snooker professionally and went on to win the BBC tournament Pot Black in 1969 - the same year they welcomed daughter Melanie.\n\nEight-year affair with Carol\n\nIn the 1970s, Ray (pictured) became one of the world's top snooker players and was given the nickname 'Dracula'\n\nSusan Reardon pictured after the snooker legend walked out on their marriage in 1985. The couple shared two children\n\nIn the 1970s, Ray became one of the world's top snooker players and was given the nickname 'Dracula' thanks to an outfit he wore to the 1974 World Championships in Manchester.\n\nStoke-based Marsden's Tailors sponsored Reardon and he emerged attired in cape, top hat and scarlet silk jacket.\n\n'Someone decided the outfit made me look like Dracula and that name stuck to me more than most,' Reardon later said.\n\nRay is believed to have met his second wife Carol around 1977 - the year he broke his World Championship streak. The couple never revealed the circumstances in which they met or what Carol was doing for work at the time.\n\nThe pair embarked on an eight-year affair, which resulted in Ray finally leaving Sue in 1985 to live with Carol.\n\nThis same year, the couple had posed for a series of happy family photos with Darren and Melanie outside Buckingham Palace when the snooker player was awarded an OBE.\n\nTrying to contain the growing scandal, the snooker player told the Daily Mirror at the time that his first wife had been 'fully informed' of his affair before he left.\n\nRetreating from the limelight\n\nSnooker legend Ray Reardon has died aged 91 following a battle with cancer, his wife Carol confirmed today\n\nAfter the news of Ray's affair was made public, the snooker star and Carol posed for one photoshoot together in their home before refusing to speak about their relationship again.\n\nThe couple married in June 1987 in a low-key ceremony at Paignton town hall.\n\nRay retired from the sport in 1991 and the couple lived in Devon for the remainder of Ray's life - with the former sporting star serving as president of Churston Golf Club.\n\nIn 2004, he teamed up with Ronnie O'Sullivan in a mentoring role at the World Championship and helped to steer the Rocket to his second world title. He had received a call from O'Sullivan's imprisoned father, Ronnie snr, to encourage the union.\n\nRead MoreBREAKING NEWS Ray Reardon dies age 91: Snooker legend passes away after cancer battle\n\nToday's sad announcement was the first time Carol Reardon had spoken publicly about her husband in decades.\n\nA statement on the WST's official website said: 'Ray Reardon, widely regarded as one of the greatest snooker players ever and a six-time world champion, has died at the age of 91.'\n\nJimmy White said on X: 'Gutted to hear my very good friend Ray Reardon has passed away.\n\n'A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game.

In a chat with Torbay Today last year, the Welsh Snookering icon expressed disbelief in an interview with Torbay Today. He said: \"Absolutely, a 100 break, couldn't believe it. I always wanted to beat my age... got a couple of 70s some time back and was happy with that.\n\n\"Then suddenly I did it ... 100. Could not believe it!

He beat Patsy Fagan before falling to eventual champion Spencer.\n\nTwelve months later and Reardon reigned at the Crucible when victory over Perrie Mans clinched a sixth world title at the age of 45.\n\nReardon remained competitive until the mid-1980s and retired in 1991.", "source": {"uri": "au.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!7 Sport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Reardon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ray Reardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widow's_peak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Widow's peak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dracula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tredegar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tredegar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tredegar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Staffordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Staffordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perrie_Mans", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perrie Mans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pulman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Pulman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Miles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graham Miles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patsy_Fagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patsy Fagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Spencer_(snooker_player)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Spencer (snooker player)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_Black", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pot Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Davis_(snooker_player)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Davis (snooker player)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crucible Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Dracula", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Count Dracula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bram Stoker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_hat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Top hat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Carom", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Carom", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Snooker", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Snooker", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Guts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Guts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XH5fL75.lxNrRItbVMb0HA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aap.com.au/5ca14c687fc2cb20f6637eeceae2b79a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749313", "eventUri": "eng-9749313", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Sadly, there is nobody left from my snooker circuit who is still playing, come to think of it.\"\n\nDuring his playing career, Reardon was nicknamed Dracula, due to his dark widow's peak - a V-shaped hairline - and sharp-toothed grin.

He's one of the reasons why a lot of us started playing.\n\n\"He put snooker on the map, alongside Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Steve Davis.

A total class act and very kind to me when I was making my way in the game. A giant of the game. Rest in Peace, mate.\"\n\nBorn in Tredegar in 1932, Reardon took up snooker and billiards as a youngster and, having followed his father down the pit at Ty Trist Colliery, proved so adept at the former that he won the Welsh Amateur Championship every year from 1950 to 1955.\n\nHe swapped the mines for a career with the police but at the age of 35, and after beating John Spencer to lift the English Amateur title in 1964, he turned professional.\n\nReardon's first world championship campaign ended in a 25-24 quarter-final defeat by Fred Davis in 1969, but he won the title for the first time a year later and repeated the feat in 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1978, the last of his wins coming at the Crucible after the tournament's move to the Sheffield venue 12 months earlier.\n\nThat win over South Africa's Perrie Mans established the then 45-year-old as the oldest man to claim the world crown, a record surpassed by Ronnie O'Sullivan in 2022.\n\nReardon reached one more world final in 1982, when he was beaten by Higgins, but won 16 other professional tournaments during a career which saw him crowned as the sport's first number one when rankings were introduced in 1975.\n\nHe retired in 1991, but continued to play into his nineties and compiled a century break in November last year.\n\nReardon's death prompted an outpouring of affection for a man whose warmth and humour helped to make him a household name.\n\nShaun Murphy, world champion in 2005, said on X: \"What a man you were Ray. An absolute animal on the table, and a total gentleman off it. It was an honour to spend time with you whether we played snooker or golf - I'll treasure every minute.

Under Reardon's tutelage, O'Sullivan won his second world title and was World No. 1 for two years straight.\n\nSpeaking about their historic partnership last year, Reardon said the soon-to-be seven-time world champion \"put 10 years on my life\". He told the BBC: \"When we got to know each other, it was like father and son, really. It was wonderful, fantastic.\"\n\nTheir pairing began in 2004, when Reardon, who earned the nickname 'Dracula' thanks to his widow's peak and prominent teeth, received a call from O'Sullivan's father, who was in prison at the time.\n\nDuring the call, O'Sullivan Sr. convinced Reardon, himself a six-time world champion, to lend a hand to his son, who had been underperforming for several years. When they met, Reardon gave O'Sullivan a big hug and told him he'd make him \"impregnable\".\n\n\"I remember him saying, 'You pot balls for fun, no one's better than you but we're going to teach you how to become impregnable',\" O'Sullivan recalled. \"I was like, 'What does that mean?' And he went, 'Well, no weaknesses'. We're going to work on your defensive game.' And that was it really. We just kind of got to work.\"\n\nReardon immediately recognised O'Sullivan's quality, and said he remembers thinking, \"This is the best player I've ever seen\". A few months later O'Sullivan won the world title and celebrated by wearing a set of Dracula fangs, in honour of his mentor, during the trophy ceremony.\n\n\"Ray's come down here and he's added a new dimension to my game,\" he said after the triumph. \"And I don't want to give no secrets away but he's really improved me in certain areas and I think that's where I've needed to develop as a player.\"\n\nWith Reardon's teachings embedded in his brain and skilled hands, O'Sullivan went on to win five further world titles, in 2008, 2012, 2013, 2020 and 2022. His victory in the latter saw him become the oldest world champion in snooker history at 46, breaking the record a 45-year-old Reardon had set back in 1978.\n\nSpeaking at the start of 2023, ahead of the Masters Snooker event, the Wordsley-born star explained the enduring legacy of his former coach. \"Ray Reardon brought a side to the game I never knew existed,\" O'Sullivan told Eurosport. \"I learnt it and now I appreciate it and use it a lot, and when I have to.\"\n\nReardon turned professional in 1967 after a short career as a police officer. He won his first world title in 1970 and won five more before the end of the decade.

He may have been born in Wales but when he moved to the Potteries he truly became one of our own.\n\nIt's no surprise that tributes have been flooding in today after the news of Ray's death at the age of 91 emerged. We have taken this piece from the archives to again tell the story of how Ray went from a miner at Florence Colliery, a police officer in Hanley to becoming one of the greatest snooker players the nation has ever seen.\n\nThis is the story about Ray's remarkable life published back in 2001:\n\n\"The former England and Yorkshire cricketer, Freddie Trueman, used to say that if the England team needed a good, reliable fast bowler years ago the selectors had to do one thing. That was to stand at the opening of a mineshaft and whistle. Without doubt a strapping miner with the ability to bowl quickly would appear out of the darkness.\n\n\"Ray Reardon was a miner who came from the Welsh Valleys. His hometown was Tredegar and it was in that town that his love for the game of snooker developed. Even to the point where he would nip off from school to go down to the snooker hall to attempt to increase his pocket money. It was no surprise that as a 12-year-old he was playing in the Welsh boys' snooker championship.\n\n\"Ray left school at 14 and hadn't reached the age of 15 when he started working in the pit. Although he was working at the colliery he continued to practise his snooker. He became amateur champion of Wales when he was 18.\n\n\"When you look at Ray's Roll of Honour it makes impressive reading. He was Amateur Champion of Wales from 1950 until 1955.\n\n\"A year later, the Reardon family moved to North Staffordshire. Pit closures forced his father, Ben, to make the move. He was taken on at Florence Colliery and Ray joined him there.\n\n\"One day, a 12ft-long heavy girder came crashing down on a boulder close to Ray. Fortunately a gap appeared and he was able to breathe. It took 12 men to get the rubble off him. Three hours later he was freed. Bruised, battered but no further the worse for wear. What a lucky escape!\n\n\"Ray's mind moved to other areas of employment and he applied and was accepted into the police force in Stoke-on-Trent. He was placed in Hanley and in 1960, P.C. Ray Reardon No 184 was nicking criminals, not heaving coal.\n\n\"His snooker was continuing well and the Police force encouraged his participation, which was in his own time. He was the Great Britain Police Champion four times between 1962 and 1966 and the English Amateur Champion in 1964.\n\n\"I had no ambition to be a professional,'' admitted Ray. \"It was something that hadn't crossed my mind until I went to South Africa in 1967.'' He went there with John Barron and took part in a Test series against South Africa which produced a 2-1 win.\n\n\"Ray did turn professional and won the first of his six World Championships in 1970. He defeated John Pulman of Bromley in a 73-frame final at the Victoria Hall, London. Ray became Stoke-on-Trent's first World Champion in any sport. \"\n\nMore on Ray's incredible in achievements in snooker can be found in our tribute article here.\n\nSign up to our main daily

That service requires people to do that job, and the quality of people you have determines the level of service you provide. Today's market is not about just finding the right people but how do you keep them?\"\n\nReardon noted there are a lot of \"lateral transfers\" happening in the Columbus area, meaning people who have spent years with an agency are now leaving for other agencies for \"a few more dollars or different benefits.\"\n\n\"The problem is when people leave, they're taking with them an incredible amount of knowledge, and the money that our agency has invested in them leaves as well,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Reardon, the department invested an average of $160,000 per firefighter in 2023 when accounting for salary, benefits, training, education and uniforms. He pointed out there are people in the department with more than 30 years of tenure, multiplying the investment made in the individual significantly while also amplifying the loss of resources if they leave.\n\nSpeaking on the increased cost of operations, Reardon said the cost of fire gear for a single firefighter has increased 81% since 2020. New fire trucks now cost approximately $1.2 million, an 89% increase since 2019, and ambulances cost an average of $450,000, which represents a 133% increase since 2021. The average maintenance cost of vehicles has grown to $172,000, a 274% increase since 2020.\n\nAs for the department's ability to plan, Reardon said calls for service have increased by 38% since 2020, and the number of overlapping calls increased from 22% to 49% in 2023.\n\n\"Every other run, when one ambulance leaves, the other is leaving, too. That leaves no one available for the next one,\" Reardon said.\n\nReardon added the department takes a number of calls determined not to be emergencies, and he suggested the community would benefit from a \"community paramedic\" who can respond to those calls rather than dedicating a firetruck or ambulance to those calls.\n\nUltimately, Reardon said the department has done very well to remain frugal through the years, but the cost to provide the services expected in the community is arriving at a level where \"something has to give.\"\n\n\"Since 2020, we've seen a 16% increase in population, a 36% increase in operational cost, and a 38% increase in calls for service,\" Reardon said to close his presentation. \"As costs continue to rise, our revenue does not (rise). The fire and EMS tax accounts for 4.7% of the property taxes collected in the city of Powell. ... Overall, our costs have increased 67% in the life of this levy, which is 10 years. Eventually, the amount collected is not enough to pay for the inflationary cost of operations. We've maintained our current income for 10 years, and unfortunately, our primary source of funding does not include an inflationary mechanism. This is why we ask the board to go the voters for additional money this fall.\"\n\nReach Dillon Davis at 740-413-0904.

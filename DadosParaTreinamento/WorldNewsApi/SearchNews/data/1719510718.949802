The Republic of Ireland striker helped Excelsior to a 7-1 win over ADO Den Haag yesterday as they reached the final of the relegation play-offs. \u201cThis is my first time scoring three goals, it\u2019s a special feeling,\u201d Parrott told Radio + TV Rijnmond afterwards. \u201cWe came here to do what we had to do, to win the game, and I thought we won it in really good fashion.\u201d The 22-year-old Dubliner, on a season-long loan from Tottenham Hotspur, was on target in the third, 27th and 30th minutes at Stadion Woudestein, bringing his tally to 13 goals and four assists for the season. The first two goals were deft, chipped finishes while he rounded off the hat-trick off from the penalty spot. \u201cI think there were two passes leading up to the [first] goal that maybe could have been offside,\u201d Patrott recalled. \u201cI knew the first one wasn\u2019t but the second one, I wasn\u2019t too sure because I couldn\u2019t see what was behind me. You have to just play until the whistle goes, good for us that it was onside and it got us off to a good start. Troy Parrott that is magic!???Take a bow son, what a finish\u2618\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/adL27Up3tu\u2014 Rep of Ireland Player Tracker (@reptracker) May 25, 2024 \u201cAfter the first one, I thought maybe the keeper will think that I will do this again. He dropped early again [for the second], it was a nice goal. \u201cIf anyone scores two goals and we get a penalty, I think it\u2019s only right that this person takes the penalty. It was good.\u201d The game was halted shortly after the third goal due to fireworks on the pitch. The hour-long delay was \u201cfrustrating,\u201d Parrott said, with the game\u2019s other goals coming on its resumption. He was substituted in the 77th minute, with NAC Brada up next across two legs on Tuesday and Sunday. \u201cFor me, I always want more, but I also understand that we have two more games to play. Especially now at this time of the season, it\u2019s difficult where we have a lot of games in a short time. \u201cWe have two important games left to play and we\u2019ll do everything that we can to win the two games.\u201d While Adam Idah and Jake O\u2019Brien were both on target in the Scottish and French Cup finals yesterday, there were other Irish goalscorers on the continent. Amber Barrett (two) and Claire O\u2019Riordan scored in Standard Liege\u2019s 5-1 win over Club Brugge. They finished overall to Anderlecht in the Belgian women\u2019s top-flight, with Barrett bringing her goalscoring record to 19 for the season.

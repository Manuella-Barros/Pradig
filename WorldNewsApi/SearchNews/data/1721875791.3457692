The actress, who plays Kate Bridgerton in the hit Netflix series, recently responded to some of the online criticism Coughlan has received regarding her appearance in season three, which focuses on her character Penelope Featherington\u2019s love story with Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton). \u201cYeah, the haters are going to hate, and I think we can all relate to that, but I really don\u2019t think that she\u2019s allowing that to bother her,\u201d Ashley said of Coughlan at the Monte-Carlo Television Festival, via People. \u201cShe has a strong and fruitful career and entire life ahead of her. And I really believe in her, as the world does as well.\u201d She continued of her praise of the Derry Girls actress, \u201cI think Nicola is just absolutely flying. She is a gorgeous, strong, confident, intelligent woman, seeing her do this press tour and spread so much joy and inspiration to everyone \u2014 especially women \u2014 all over the world. And I\u2019m inspired by her as well. She\u2019s also a really kind human being, and I think that\u2019s such a universal language that people can relate to.\u201d Coughlan also shut down speculation earlier this month that her waist was \u201cphotoshopped\u201d in season three of Bridgerton. \u201cI saw some trolls. They were like, \u2018They photoshopped your waist,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018No, they did not,'\u201d she told People. \u201cI think if you wear corsetry for long enough, your body really molds to it,\u201d Coughlan explained of the show\u2019s Regency-inspired costumes. \u201cSometimes they come in for a fitting for a fashion designer and they put a corset on me and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, you can go tight,\u2019 and they go, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018My body now will go, \u2018Whew.'\u201d Bridgerton is currently streaming on Netflix.", "summary": "Simone Ashley is coming to her friend and\u00a0Bridgerton\u00a0co-star\u00a0Nicola Coughlan&#8217;s defense amid recent body-shaming comments.

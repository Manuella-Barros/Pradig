And the one thing that I will tell you about our team is we've never been about the title.\" She then listed off her only important titles: child of God, wife, and mother.\n\n\"I could go off and live a very quiet life,\" added Miller, who taught elementary grades in Carmel for 33 years and, as a M4L activist, once called for a \"mass exodus\" from public schools with the help of private school vouchers.\n\n\"There's kind of a joke about the fact that I'd like to go scuba diving eventually, and that was my plan after I retired from teaching in 2020, and it's yet to happen,\" Miller continued. \"And God keeps giving me different directions and things that he wants me to do.\"\n\nMiller did not return messages left by The Daily Beast, nor did Reitenour via her campaign.\n\nAccording to the Indianapolis Star, the conservative tag-team must collect nearly 37,000 signatures by July 1 to be placed on the November ballot. The women, who met at a Bible study, announced the same on Facebook with a photo of themselves and supporters under a Donald Trump flag featuring the words \"Miss me yet?\"\n\nWeeks earlier, Reitenour was a longshot Republican gubernatorial candidate before placing second to last in the May primary with 4.9 percent of the vote. (Miller was originally billed as Reitenour's pick for the state's Secretary of Education; now she's taking the lead, with Reitenour running as lieutenant governor.)\n\nTheir campaign website mirrors some common M4L talking points and lists education at the top of the platform. \"Teachers' opinions on political and social topics, critical race theory, and sexual orientation and gender identity issues have no place in the classroom,\" the site says.\n\nThe website also advocates for keeping trans athletes out of women's sports, the state's \"school choice\" program, and anti-abortion policies.\n\nMiller was in the spotlight last June over her chapter's Hitler newsletter flub that arrived not long after the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) labeled M4L, generously bankrolled by right-wing organizations and donors, an anti-government extremist group.\n\nIt also sparked national headlines ahead of the parental-rights group's annual summit in Philadelphia that brought in days of protests from LGBTQ activists and allies and appearances from Republican presidential candidates.\n\nThe Hamilton County chapter's bulletin had featured the words of the F\u00fchrer on the front page -- \"He alone, who OWNS the youth, GAINS the future\" -- before issuing a clarification and eventually removing the quotation altogether.\n\n\"The quote from a horrific leader should put parents on alert,\" the clarification read. \"If the government has control over our children today, they control our country's future. We The People must be vigilant and protect children from an overreaching government.\"\n\nUltimately, Miller apologized for quoting the Nazi leader. \"We condemn Adolf Hitler's actions and his dark place in human history,\" she said at the time. \"We should not have quoted him in our newsletter and express our deepest apology.\"\n\nBut M4L bosses and speakers at the summit defended Miller, including M4L co-founder Tiffany Justice, who told an awards dinner to applause, \"I stand with that mom. No one thought she was quoting Hitler. No one. That's a lie.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another member of Miller's chapter appeared to justify the passage, according to a Vice report.\n\nCo-founder Shelly Stewart explained in a Facebook comment, \"We have had a few questions around the quote from Adolf Hitler and why it was used. His quote is meant to shock and scare every liberty-loving adult. We the People must protect our children and keep government in check.\"\n\nMiller has also advocated for other right-wing causes, writing in her chapter's Facebook group in 2022: \"It would be AWESOME to get a Turning Point USA club in all of our Hamilton County schools where kids can have a place where they won't be silenced and cancelled for loving America and having Christian and Conservative views!\"\n\nIn other posts, she's posed for photos at trainings with the conservative Leadership Institute in Sarasota and alongside Gays Against Groomers founder Jaimee Michell, whose group was added to SPLC's list of anti-LGBTQ hate groups this year.\n\nMiller has also stoked fears about schools teaching identity issues while ignoring poor test scores in a podcast with Reitenour.\n\n\"We don't have time to talk about social justice and if you're a boy or a girl, or a rabbit or a gopher, or whatever you want to be today,\" she said. \"We're going back to required minutes, where they have to have so much instruction.\n\n\"I want you to know, when I'm back in charge of that, we're going back to teaching.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily

The family is under attack,\" Reitenour said in a video posted to Facebook announcing the candidates' new independent campaign. \"What we need are strong leaders with a strong vision, and we have that vision.\"\n\nThey're emphasizing education, opposition to government overreach and individual freedoms in their campaign.\n\n\"It's hard to tell parents that their school systems are failing their students, but that is the truth,\" Miller said in the video. \"That is where we are.\"\n\nThe duo will need to collect nearly 37,000 signatures by July 1 in order to be placed on the ballot in November.\n\nMiller, a retired Carmel public school teacher, established the Hamilton County chapter of Moms for Liberty, a controversial parental rights group, in 2021. As a national organization, the group has supported book bans and pushed back against inclusion in curriculum of subjects like sex education and racial and LGBTQ issues.Moms for Liberty has been categorized by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an extremist group.\n\nOn Reitenour's campaign: The governor candidate you haven't heard of: How Jamie Reitenour qualified for the ballot\n\nHamilton County's chapter came under fire last year for including a quote from Adolf Hitler in a newsletter. The group first uploaded a version attempting to give context for the quote to their site, and later removed both the quote and context. Party leaders from both sides spoke out against the quote, and Miller apologized, saying the group condemns Hitler's actions and should not have used the quote.\n\nMiller also ran unsuccessfully for an at-large seat on the Carmel Clay School Board in 2020.\n\nDuring Reitenour's longshot bid for governor in the May Republican primary this year, Reitenour tapped her to serve as the head of the state's K-12 education agency should she have been elected.\n\nReitenour lost to four other Republicans in the primary, including to Sen. Mike Braun, who secured the Republican nomination. The Miller-Reitenour campaign is now using Reitenour's old campaign website, jamie4ingov.com.\n\nReitenour received 4.8% of the gubernatorial vote in the primary election, which amounted to just under 29,000 voters. Even if every Reitenour voter signed Miller and Reitenour's ballot petition, they'd still need more than 8,000 additional signatures. Only one Republican candidate received fewer votes: Curtis Hill, with 4.5% of the vote.\n\nThe nearly 37,000 signatures may be a challenge, but Reitenour has met signature requirements before. She collected 500 signatures in each of the nine congressional districts to run as a Republican gubernatorial candidate, a notoriously tricky requirement, thanks to her team of volunteers.\n\nReitenour said the pair received an influx of support after her loss on May 7, and that this made them \"take up the cause.\"\n\nOne of Miller and Reitenour's main priorities is education. Their campaign website emphasizes goals similar to Moms for Liberty's, specifically, securing parental rights in the classroom. They oppose discussions about political and social issues in the classroom.\n\nA flyer posted on Reitenour's campaign Facebook states they want to \"eliminate CRT and SEL.\" CRT refers to critical race theory, a way of considering America's history through a racial lens in academia that's become a Republican political buzzword. SEL refers to social-emotional learning, an educational framework meant to help children regulate their emotions, think critically and connect with others.\n\n\"We love the idea of DEI becoming ABC: a better citizen,\" Reitenour said in the Facebook video.\n\nTheir priorities also include lowering taxes and decreasing government spending. They say they would end projects such as Link 101, an already scrapped highway project that would have extended through southeastern Indiana.\n\nBoth candidates have expressed how their religious beliefs have driven their campaigning. Miller said she doesn't belong to a party but to \"Jesus Christ,\" and Reitenour ran for governor because of her religious beliefs.\n\nMiller and Reitenour's campaign site also mentions they are anti-abortion, pro-Second Amendment and they want to prohibit transgender Hoosiers from playing on sports teams that don't match the gender assigned to them at birth.\n\nA spokesperson for Miller's campaign declined to make the two candidates available for an interview until July, after the filing deadline.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors":

Gov. bid in 2024 general election with Paige Miller", "body": "INDIANAPOLIS -- A familiar face from the Republican gubernatorial primary has joined an independent ticket as a lieutenant governor candidate for the upcoming general election.\n\nIn late May, Jamie Reitenour announced she would run as lieutenant governor on an independent ticket with Paige Miller. Miller, a retired educator and the founder of the Moms for Liberty chapter in Hamilton County, is running for governor as an independent.\n\nReitenour initially ran for Indiana governor as a Republican in the May primary election. According to previous reports, Reitenour recorded 4.81% of the vote in May, which was a little under 29,000 votes.\n\nAccording to Indiana election law, a primary candidate is not able to eligible to become a candidate for the same office in the general election. This limited Reitenour from running for governor as an independent, opening the door for her to join Miller's independent ticket.\n\nIn a letter on the campaign's website, Reitenour said that the values and principles that conservative Hoosiers hold dear are not the same values that the other Republican candidates had.\n\n\"As a lifelong Republican and candidate on the ground with Hoosiers,\" the letter read, \"Jamie was appalled by the party's political games, the lack of true consideration for the people, the obvious interest in expanding government and social programs, the disregard for small business owners and the absolute silence in response to the attack on the family from all sides.\"\n\nIn a video message on their joint campaign page in late May, both Miller and Reitenour said they were in mourning after May 7 and thought it was time to change direction. After that, they said that many individuals were reaching out to them to see what their next plans would be.\n\n\"I sought the Lord and I called on people who knew him, knew our journey, and I talked to the strongest leader that had traveled with me,\" Reitenour said. \"When Paige and I had a conversation, we looked at the burden on our hearts for the state of Indiana. We looked at the fact that we traveled all over the state... What you should know is that there are two leaders that have come forward. It is my great honor to run as lieutenant governor with Paige Miller as governor.\"\n\nThe Miller/Reitenour campaign, according to its website, are focusing on some of the following subjects as they prepare for November's election:\n\nMiller said in the video that she does not belong to a political party, stressing that it has never been about the title.\n\n\"As I look at taking this job over, and I will tell you, it took time and prayer, my husband and I discussed it for a long time, it wasn't a decision we came to lightly nor was it one we came to in just a few minutes,\" Miller said in the video. \"...My ability then to have an impact for the conservatives in our state, that's who I'm doing this for.\"\n\nThe campaign believes that running as an independent campaign shows that they are not members of the political elite, stressing that they are for Hoosiers.\n\n\"We must start realizing that exclusive rules created by political systems are a distraction from the dangerous reality that our government was not constitutionally intended to be run by the elite,\" the letter read. \"It was intended to be of the people, by the people, and for the people. Enough is enough. It is time for truth, transparency and engagement.\n\nIn the video, Reitenour said the campaign is operating a plan that they believe will bring a successful independent ticket in the state of Indiana.

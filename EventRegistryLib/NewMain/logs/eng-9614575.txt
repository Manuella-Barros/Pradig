There was also a warrant to purchase up to five million in additional shares at $10 per share. The private placement closed on Thursday. Stablecoin issuer Tether Holdings Ltd. has acquired a $100 million stake in Bitdeer Technologies Group, the US-listed Bitcoin miner owned by Chinese billionaire Jihan Wu, with an option to purchase an additional $50 million in shares within a year.\n\nThe two firms entered into a subscription agreement for a private placement of 18.6 million Class A ordinary shares, Bitdeer said in a statement on Friday, which generated $100 million in gross proceeds. There was also a warrant to purchase up to five million in additional shares at $10 per share. The private placement closed on Thursday. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as the placement agent.\n\nThe deal will fund an expansion of Bitdeer's data center operations, development of ASIC-based crypto mining equipment and other general corporate purposes, Bitdeer said. The companies didn't disclose what percentage of Bitdeer is now held by Tether under the agreement. Tether didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe agreement marks a major step forward for Tether in its plan to become a major Bitcoin miner, having begun construction of its own mining facilities in Uruguay, Paraguay and El Salvador last year. The British Virgin Islands-incorporated company, which issues the world's most used cryptocurrency USDT, said in November that it planned to spend half a billion dollars within six months on the effort.\n\nBitdeer is one of the largest public crypto miners listed in the US with a market capitalization of around $670 million. Headquartered in Singapore, Bitdeer has datacenters in the US, Norway and Bhutan. Shares of Bitdeer, which had slumped more than 40% this year, rose about 6.5% to $6.20.\n\nBitdeer was previously in talks with private credit firms to arrange about $100 million in financing, Bloomberg News reported in March. It was unclear if those discussions remain ongoing following Tether's injection.\n\nBitcoin mining involves the operation of power-hungry computers that secure the blockchain, earning new tokens as a reward. In April, these rewards were halved as part of a programmed upgrade to the Bitcoin network called \"the halving,\" which occurs every four years. In essence, the change made it about half as profitable to be a Bitcoin miner.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin's price reached a record high in March, driven in part by optimism surrounding newly-launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US. Bitcoin traded up around 0.7% at $68,800 on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tether (cryptocurrency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_placement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private placement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Common stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stablecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_Fitzgerald", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cantor Fitzgerald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Paraguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Token coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-110600385,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-128448,overlay-etmarkets/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614575", "eventUri": "eng-9614575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 230, "relevance": 1}

This significant investment highlights Tether's growing interest in the bitcoin mining sector and its strategic moves to diversify and strengthen its presence in the broader cryptocurrency economy. Bitdeer's stock (BTDR) is up over 13% intraday, showing market approval of Tether's investment.\n\nInvestment Breakdown\n\nRecently Bitdeer has secured a subscription agreement for the private placement of 18,587,360 Class A ordinary shares, generating $100 million in proceeds. While, the agreement also includes a warrant for Tether to purchase an additional 5 million shares at $10 each, potentially adding $50 million to the investment. Hence, the funds will be used to expand Bitdeer's data centres and develop new ASIC-based mining rigs for efficient Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nImpact on Bitdeer\n\nFollowing the news, Bitdeer's shares saw a positive reaction in the market, jumping over 4% to $6.08 in pre-market trading. This surge reflects investor confidence in the company's growth potential and the positive impact of the substantial funding from Tether. At present, Bitdeer shares are traded between $6 and $7.\n\nTether's BTC Mining Call\n\nThis move shows their commitment to supporting the crypto economy and a bullish interest in BTC mining. By backing BTC mining, Tether aims to diversify its investments and improve the reliability of its USDT token. It's part of their strategy to promote blockchain technology, like the one offered by Bitdeer.\n\nExpansion Plans and Market Reaction\n\nIn the meanwhile, Bitdeer also plans to use the new capital for expanding data centers and developing advanced mining rigs, which are crucial steps in enhancing its mining capacity and efficiency. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that Bitdeer is a leading player in Bitcoin mining. He praises their advanced tech and strong focus on research and development in the industry. By investing in state-of-the-art infrastructure, Bitdeer aims to maintain a competitive edge in the highly dynamic and resource-intensive bitcoin mining industry.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Tether's investment in Bitdeer is a win-win. Bitdeer gets funds to grow, and Tether deepens its ties to Bitcoin's core.

While, the agreement also includes a warrant for Tether to purchase an additional 5 million shares at $10 each, potentially adding $50 million to the investment. Hence, the funds will be used to expand Bitdeer's data centres and develop new ASIC-based mining rigs for efficient Bitcoin mining operations.\n\nFollowing the news, Bitdeer's shares saw a positive reaction in the market, jumping over 4% to $6.08 in pre-market trading. This surge reflects investor confidence in the company's growth potential and the positive impact of the substantial funding from Tether. At present, Bitdeer shares are traded between $6 and $7.\n\nThis move shows their commitment to supporting the crypto economy and a bullish interest in BTC mining. By backing BTC mining, Tether aims to diversify its investments and improve the reliability of its USDT token. It's part of their strategy to promote blockchain technology, like the one offered by Bitdeer.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Bitdeer also plans to use the new capital for expanding data centers and developing advanced mining rigs, which are crucial steps in enhancing its mining capacity and efficiency. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that Bitdeer is a leading player in Bitcoin mining. He praises their advanced tech and strong focus on research and development in the industry. By investing in state-of-the-art infrastructure, Bitdeer aims to maintain a competitive edge in the highly dynamic and resource-intensive bitcoin mining industry.\n\nOverall, Tether's investment in Bitdeer is a win-win. Bitdeer gets funds to grow, and Tether deepens its ties to Bitcoin's core. This partnership showcases how crypto leaders team up to push the industry forward.", "source": {"uri": "coinpedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coinpedia - Fintech & Cryptocurreny News Media| Crypto Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "debashree_patra@coinpedia.org", "name": "Debashree Patra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tether_(cryptocurrency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tether (cryptocurrency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stablecoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Day trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Mineral_Exploration_and_Extraction", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Mineral Exploration and Extraction", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Mining_and_Drilling/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Mining and Drilling/Associations", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Mining", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Mining", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "http://image.coinpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/04184504/Tethers-Surge-to-100Bn-Market-Cap-Mints-1Bn-USDT-As-Bitcoin-Price-Hit-65000-.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614575", "eventUri": "eng-9614575", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

There was also a warrant to purchase up to five million in additional shares at $10 per share. The private placement closed on Thursday. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as the placement agent.\n\nThe deal will fund an expansion of Bitdeer's data center operations, development of ASIC-based crypto mining equipment and other general corporate purposes, Bitdeer said. The companies didn't disclose what percentage of Bitdeer is now held by Tether under the agreement. Tether didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe agreement marks a major step forward for Tether in its plan to become a major Bitcoin miner, having begun construction of its own mining facilities in Uruguay, Paraguay and El Salvador last year. The British Virgin Islands-incorporated company, which issues the world's most used cryptocurrency USDT, said in November that it planned to spend half a billion dollars within six months on the effort.\n\nRead More: Biggest Stablecoin Firm Tether Is Becoming a Major Bitcoin Miner\n\nBitdeer is one of the largest public crypto miners listed in the US with a market capitalization of around $670 million. Headquartered in Singapore, Bitdeer has datacenters in the US, Norway and Bhutan. Shares of Bitdeer, which had slumped more than 40% this year, rose about 6.5% to $6.20.\n\nBitdeer was previously in talks with private credit firms to arrange about $100 million in financing, Bloomberg News reported in March. It was unclear if those discussions remain ongoing following Tether's injection.\n\nRead More: Crypto Miner Bitdeer in Talks With Private Credit for Capital\n\nBitcoin mining involves the operation of power-hungry computers that secure the blockchain, earning new tokens as a reward. In April, these rewards were halved as part of a programmed upgrade to the Bitcoin network called \"the halving,\" which occurs every four years. In essence, the change made it about half as profitable to be a Bitcoin miner.\n\nConversely, Bitcoin's price reached a record high in March, driven in part by optimism surrounding newly-launched spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US.

Bitdeer aims to use the fund to expand its data center, develop an ASIC-based mining rig, strengthen working capital for ongoing operations and other general corporate purposes.\n\nAccording to a press release, Bitdeer signed an investment agreement that involves the issuance of 18,587,360 Class A ordinary shares to Tether. Additionally, Tether acquired a warrant to purchase up to five million additional shares. Note that all shares are priced at $10 per share.\n\nThe transaction was finalized on Thursday, generating $100 million in immediate proceeds from the share offering. The total investment could reach $150 million when the warrant becomes fully exercised.\n\nThe warrant comes with customary safeguards against dilution, including adjustments for share dividends, splits and similar actions. Additionally, it features weighted average anti-dilution protection for share issuances below the initial warrant exercise price. Tether reserves the right to exercise the warrant within a one-year window following the closing date.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as the placement agent for this private transaction. However, the securities cannot be offered or sold within the United States without registration or an exemption.

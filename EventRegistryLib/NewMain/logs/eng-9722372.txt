They weren't gonna give it to us, we had to take it, and it was a great battle like always.\"\n\nThe Liberty started strong, living up to their reputation as the best first-quarter team in the league. Despite a double-digit lead early on, the Sun, known for their defense, clawed back into the game, turning it into a gritty, back-and-forth affair by the fourth quarter.\n\nIn the closing moments, the Liberty's defense, led by Ionescu and Breanna Stewart, made crucial plays. Ionescu scored to put the Liberty back in front, and Stewart followed with two massive blocks. Another bucket by Ionescu extended the lead, and she capped off the game by blocking Tyasha Harris' potential game-tying three-pointer.\n\n\"No 3s, I knew that,\" Ionescu said. \"Obviously Ty's a great shooter and we were gonna switch, so happy to get that block.

But with Sabrina Ionescu and Breanna Stewart leading the way, the New York Liberty overcame the Sun, 71-68 at the Mohegan Sun Arena.\n\nThe loss is the Sun's second at home to the Liberty this season and the team will look to bounce back in their next game when they host the Phoenix Mercury (11-10) on Sunday, July 14 at 1 p.m.\n\nBonner led Connecticut with 22 points, her third consecutive game with over 20 points. She grabbed nine rebounds and sank three triples in the game, two of which came in the first as the Sun fell behind early.\n\nIonescu and Stewart were dominant from the start, scoring 10 points each in the opening quarter alone as the Liberty took a 10-point lead into the second, shooting over 70% from the field.\n\n\"You can't spot a team like New York 10 points in the first quarter,\" Connecticut Sun coach Stephanie White said. \"(The Liberty are) too good, they're too deep, they make you pay for mistakes and they did that to us today.\"\n\nThe Sun struggled to slow the Liberty down in the second and the lead grew to as high as 14 before Rachel Branham cut it back to 11 with a deep three from the left side. Branham's three breathed new life into the Sun, as they tightened up on defense and closed the half on an impressive 17-4 run to get back within one.\n\n\"(Banham's three) was big because of the time we had (left),\" White said. \"We were looking to come back, we needed buckets.\n\n\"It's also big because we're not a team that's making a high number of up three-point shots. So anytime we have an opportunity to space the floor, we believe in Rachel (Banham) when she comes in the game that she's gonna knock down every shot that she shoots. But when you're trying to come back, getting a big momentum play like that is important and she was able to knock it down.\"\n\nNew York stormed out of halftime and re-established control with a 9-0 run. But Connecticut weathered the run and clawed itself back into the game. An 8-0 run late in the third got the Sun back within one possession after a made jump shot from Bonner. But the Liberty responded well in the final two minutes of the quarter and got themselves some breathing room heading into the final period.\n\nDefense won out in the fourth as the two titans of the Eastern Conference duked it out. Every made basket was hard-fought and for as hard as the Sun worked to generate enough offense, they could not do enough to stop Ionescu and Stewart down the stretch.\n\n\"(The Liberty) move with pace,\" Sun's center Brionna Jones said. \"They know what they're looking for when they're executing their offense.\"\n\nConnecticut had its chance to force overtime, trailing by three with possession of the ball and only 4.4 seconds remaining. But once again, New York's late-game execution was too much for the Sun as they forced Tyasha Harris into a difficult three at the buzzer that Ionescu managed to get a piece of to secure the win.\n\n\"No, we didn't get the shot we wanted,\" White said. \"We had a couple of different looks out of a three-point shot that we wanted to get, (New York) took away one of the reads and we weren't able to get to it.\n\n\"Against the top teams, it's got to be consistency and execution for 40 minutes and there wasn't enough of that on our end.

We haven't peaked and we also don't want to peak too soon, and we just want to continue to learn and grow.\"\n\nSabrina Ionescu, the 2020 No. 1 draft pick, compiled her 20th career game with a least 20 points (she finished with a team-high 21 on Wednesday), five rebounds and five assists. After the teams traded leads in the final minutes, Ionescu's basket with 4.5 seconds remaining in the fourth proved to be the game-winner, and she then sealed the deal on the Sun's last possession with a block on Ty Harris' 3-point shot attempt. Ionescu also hit a floater at the 1:58 mark to put the Liberty ahead for good.\n\nNew York's 71 points were their fewest in a win since August 3, 2022, before the team's \"superteam\" era with the arrival of Stewart (18 points and 14 rebounds on Tuesday), Jonquel Jones (8 points, 11 rebounds) and Courtney Vandersloot (11 points) in early 2023.\n\n\"Not a real high-scoring game, but we found a way to win and we got stops when we needed it,\" coach Sandy Brondello said. \"And obviously Sabrina made a really massive shot.\"\n\n\"Block!\" Stewart interjected.\n\nThe Liberty's 13 3-point attempts marked a drastic difference from their 42 on Sunday in an upset loss to the Indiana Fever, but on Tuesday they bested Connecticut in the paint 40-26, even leading by as many as 14 in the second quarter before the home team's run made it a one-point game at halftime.\n\n\"I think that's just the evolution of this team,\" Ionescu said. \"It's not being one-dimensional and knowing we're going to go in every single day and do the same thing, but be able to read what defenses are giving us and attack in different ways.\"\n\nNew York is now 13-0 when leading at the half this season, the league's only team that's unbeaten in those situations.\n\n\"I think it's a testament to just our commitment,\" Ionescu said of the pivotal fourth quarter, where the Sun outscored the Liberty 14-12 but didn't score in the final 2:11. \"They went on runs, we went on runs, and we really stayed poised. And I think that's a huge part as to why we won.\"\n\nThe Sun -- who doubled up the Liberty from the 3-point line with six treys -- were led by DeWanna Bonner's 22 points and Brionna Jones' 17.\n\nThe Liberty were without Betnijah Laney-Hamilton on Wednesday due to a knee issue, but they are hopeful she can take the court Thursday when New York hosts the Chicago Sky. They then travel to Chicago for a rematch on Saturday.\n\n\"This is a team that continues to get more connected every single day,\" Brondello said. \"I think all these experiences that we go through, in the end, are positive. Even when we lose, we learn from it. Chemistry is important for us. You have to make sure you go out there, look at the next person and know that you can trust them. We've got to execute to the best of our ability.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexa_philippou@espn.com", "name": "Alexa Philippou",

The past week, however, has had her play sick.\n\nIonescu has faced opponents of both an internal and abroad variety this week, fighting an illness during an eventful period on the 2024 Liberty timeline. Fresh off Eastern Conference Player of the Week honors, Ionescu averaged 16.3 points, 4.3 assists, and 4.0 rebounds in three games, including two victories.\n\nSeveral New Yorkers were said to be under the weather in the midst of a five-game winning streak that ended on Saturday in Indiana but the team has nonetheless kept its hold on the WNBA leaderboard's top slot thanks to a franchise-best start (17-4).\n\nThe mild locker room bug noticeably got to Ionescu, who raspily braved the week's postgame press conferences. Adjustments carried on after the clock hit zero, as Ionescu swapped out her usual postgame refreshment of Bodyarmor, her endorsed Queens-based sports drink owned by the Coca-Cola Company, for tea and honey. She was also listed as questionable for last Tuesday's vital victory over Minnesota, one she dubbed \"personal\" after earning 17 points and five assists and rebounds each in a 76-67 triumph at Barclays Center.\n\nWhile her illness partly ate away at her usual success rates from the field (19-of-60 over the last three games), her efforts nonetheless proved inspiring to seafoam personnel.\n\n\"It means a lot (to have a teammate like that),\" center/forward Jonquel Jones said shortly after learning she'd be attending the WNBA All-Star Game with Ionescu after Tuesday's win. \"What she did tonight is the unselfish part of her. She could've stayed home (but) she understands the importance of this game, that (Minnesota) was a team that had our number and we wanted to kind of be out there and show them what we can do when we play our style of basketball. It's a blessing to have a teammate like her.\"\n\nHead coach Sandy Brondello sees it as the latest example of Ionescu's evolution, embracing further responsibilities as a voice ... even when she has none.\n\n\"She's battled through. She had it massive in the last game, could hardly speak, missed shootaround,\" head coach Sandy Brondello said prior to Saturday's game against the Indiana Fever. \"I'm just really proud of her, not just what she's done when she's sick but all season long. I think she has continued to grow her game at both ends of the floor. It's exciting because she's going to continue to get better and better.\"\n\nDespite her reduced state, Ionescu continued her historic paces from deep: the top pick of the 2020 draft has hit at least one triple in 46 consecutive games, good for sole possession of the third-longest streak in WNBA history. She's also tied for second on the Liberty's all-time three-pointer list in just her fifth professional tour. One more will break a tie at 331 with Becky Hammon and put her another triple closer to all-time leader Crystal Robinson (400).\n\nJust past the midway point of the 2024 season, a Liberty playoff spot is mostly assured. Homecourt advantage remains a valuable commodity, even if none of the seven playoff participants figure to be an easy matchup.\n\nDeclining to take the floor in favor of sick leave was never a question for Ionescu for all that and more.\n\n\"There's little kids with signs that say they traveled thousands of miles to come watch me play,\" Ionescu noted after a June 30 win over Atlanta. \"If I was walking I was going to try and get out there and play ... I'm just trying to continue to stay aggressive.\"\n\n\"Obviously, my shot wasn't there. I was just really focused on trying to get through the game. But I saw a few go in, thankfully. Hopefully a few more days of rest, they'll be going in more consistently.\"\n\nGranted four days to recover further after Saturday's game in Indianapolis, Ionescu will be back in action come Wednesday morning, when the Liberty faces the Connecticut Sun in a vital matinee (11 a.m. ET, WWOR).", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

A no-look pass from Breanna Stewart to a streaking Leonie Fiebich for a transition 3. A laugh between Sabrina Ionescu and Vandersloot after Ionescu looked off a defender and hit a triple. A cohesive defensive effort with movement, communication and helpside rotations.\n\nThe on-court connections among the Liberty are obvious. But that wasn't always the case.\n\nLast season, when the words \"superteam\" dominated Liberty-related headlines, New York didn't always deliver the expected product on the court.\n\nAnd despite making the WNBA Finals, New York endured criticism of a lack of chemistry, all of which came to a head when Las Vegas guard Kelsey Plum called them out after her Aces topped New York for the title.\n\n\"We also knew that, as much as they're a team, they're not a team, if that makes sense,\" Plum said. \"They're really good individual players, but they don't care about each other. And you can tell in those moments. They revert back to individual basketball.\"\n\nShe later said the quote was taken out of context, but the damage -- at least as far as the Liberty were concerned -- was done.\n\nIt added insult to injury, as the Liberty watched the Aces, who have long been praised for their closeness as a unit, celebrate their second title. New York's players, coaches and GM responded in different ways, but at the core of their comments the Liberty made one thing clear: They are a team, and they do care about each other.\n\nBut saying that doesn't mean much. Showing it on the court does.\n\nThis season, the Liberty's approach and chemistry are on full display as they sit alone atop the standings after defeating the Connecticut Sun 71-68 on Wednesday. The victory also further strengthened their case for a No. 1 seed for the playoffs.\n\n\"It's about just playing one game at a time, and let's just win today, just win the moment,\" Liberty coach Sandy Brondello said before the game. \"As long as we're buying into what we want to do, and we're doing it together, we're in good shape.\"\n\nThe buy-in started last season, even if it didn't show right away. Players like Jones and Stewart, both former MVPs who are used to being their teams' centerpiece, learned to play together. Vandersloot left the only team she'd ever played for in Chicago to run a new offense, and Ionescu improved as a facilitator and defender.\n\nNow, their efforts are resulting in wins, separating New York (18-4) from the rest of the WNBA and making them the current title favorites.\n\nBeating the Sun (17-5) in front of a pro-Connecticut crowd Wednesday was part of the process. And so was losing to the Aces in the playoffs last season, no matter how painful it was.\n\n\"Last year was such a learning experience,\" Jones said. \"This year we've been able to hit the ground running. You can feel the trust of everybody out there, regardless of if I'm hitting shots or whatever is going in. I know my teammates have my back.\"\n\nIn the offseason, New York made togetherness a priority. They spent time as a team outside of the gym, even starting a bookclub. And as the season progresses, so does the Liberty's chemistry.\n\nThey needed it to defeat the Sun in a close game at Mohegan Sun, as Connecticut was fueled by the shrieks of Camp Day kids and energized despite the 11 a.m. ET start time.\n\nWith two minutes left in the third quarter, the Sun cut the Liberty's lead -- which was once as many as 14 points -- down to 53-51. The Sun tied the game at 63 with 4:59 remaining in the fourth quarter, when Ty Harris drove and finished a layup off the glass. From there it was a back-and-forth contest until the buzzer.\n\nIonescu finished things off with a runner in the lane to put her team up by the final margin with 4.4 seconds left, followed by a block on Harris' buzzer-beating 3-point attempt on the other end.\n\nAfter the game, Jones stood in front of reporters to discuss Ionescu's clutch plays at the end of the game. Then, greeted the guard outside the Liberty locker room. \"I was talking about you,\" Jones told her with a smile.\n\nThe two have been vital to the Liberty's success, building a bond that's led to a dominant two-player game.\n\n\"When I came in, I wanted to have that connection with her, just be a really good teammate for her,\" Jones told reporters last week. \"Our chemistry has grown as we spent more time together and you can see it on the court. ... It's a blessing to have a teammate like her.\"\n\nAnd when the Sun made their comeback Wednesday, the Liberty often leaned on Ionescu and Jones to run that two-player game on offense.\n\nWhen DeWanna Bonner hit three free throws early in the fourth quarter to get the Sun within one point, the Liberty ran an action to get Ionescu the ball at the top of the key. Then, a cutting Jones made her way to the free-throw line, catching a pass and driving to the rim for an easy bucket.\n\nAnd if it wasn't Jones or Ionescu, it was Stewart or Vandersloot.

Though she pulled down a team-high 12 caroms, Jones failed to reach double digits in scoring for the third time in four games.\n\nThe 2021 league MVP as a member of the Sun also went just 2-of-6 at the line.\n\n\"You know, her missing those three free throws is uncharacteristic for her,\" Brondello said of Jones, who spent her first six seasons in Connecticut before powering New York to its first WNBA Finals since 2002 last year.\n\n\"So it was just, you know, wasn't at her best today, but we know that she'll bounce back,\" Brondello added.\n\nThe Sun (17-4) aren't worried a bounce-back.\n\nConnecticut has reeled off three straight victories and has won four of its last five to pull into a deadlock with New York.\n\nOn Sunday, DeWanna Bonner was on fire from outside the arc, knocking down a career-high seven 3-pointers en route to 23 points as the Sun beat visiting Atlanta, 80-67.\n\nConnecticut was even hotter when it began the campaign 9-0. But that was before New York earned a spot in the Commissioner's Cup Final with an 82-75 win over the Sun at Downtown's Barclays Center on June 8.\n\nIonescu led the way with 24 points and Jones burned her former teammates for 22 in the first meeting between the teams since last year's Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe Liberty won that series in four tough games after dropping the opener at Barclays.\n\nNow, they'll try to leave Connecticut as the leauge's top team, a title they took from the Sun for the better part of the last month.\n\n\"Yeah, it looks like we have to make sure we bring the same focus for every opponent,\" Brondello insisted.\n\nGIVE ME LIBERTY: In five career regular-season meetings against her ex-team, Jones is averaging 14.8 and 8.6 rebounds per contest.

These are \"camp day\" games, which gives kids across the country a chance to catch some live action. We'll be with you all day long recapping the best finishes and individual performances.\n\nHere are some key takeaways so far:\n\nLiberty block out Sun, take sole possession of first place\n\nThe first game of the day featured the top two teams in the league, and the showdown was just as competitive as everyone expected. Thanks to some late-game heroics by Sabrina Ionescu, the New York Liberty took sole possession of first place with a dramatic victory over the Connecticut Sun, 71-68.\n\n\"Yeah, we knew it was a big game,\" said Ionescu, who finished with 21 points, five rebounds and five assists. \"Obviously the top teams in the league and we knew we had to come in, early game, come with a lot of intensity and come out here and take it. They weren't gonna give it to us, we had to take it, and it was a great battle like always.\"\n\nAll season long, the Liberty have been the best first-quarter team in the league (plus-20.8 net rating entering Wednesday), and they quickly jumped out to a double-digit lead. The Sun, though, are an elite defensive bunch, and it was no surprise that they were able to grind their way back into the contest.\n\nBy the fourth quarter, it was a back-and-forth game with little scoring and plenty of physicality. The Sun took the lead multiple times, including with 2:11 to play on a layup by DiJonai Carrington. Those would be their last points, as Sabrina Ionescu, Breanna Stewart and the Liberty took control down the stretch with some elite defense of their own.\n\nIonescu scored to put the Liberty back in front, then Stewart came up with two massive blocks, before another Ionescu bucket pushed the lead up to three. Then, on the final possession, Ionescu blocked Tyasha Harris' potential game-tying 3-pointer to secure the win.\n\n\"No 3s, I knew that,\" Ionescu said. \"Obviously Ty's a great shooter and we were gonna switch, so happy to get that block. I didn't want to go to overtime.\"\n\nClark puts on a show in defeat\n\nCaitlin Clark has grown more and more comfortable in recent weeks, and she put on yet another show Wednesday. It was not enough for the Indiana Fever, though, as their fourth-quarter comeback attempt fell short and they lost to the Washington Mystics, 89-84.\n\nClark finished with 29 points five rebounds, 13 assists, five steals and three blocks, tying her career-high in assists in the process. She has now reached double figures in assists in five of her last six outings and has registered four consecutive points-assists double-doubles, which is the second-longest streak ever.\n\nThis was also Clark's second game this season with at least 25 points and 10 assists. There is only one other such game by a rookie in WNBA history. For the season, Clark is now averaging 7.6 assists per game, which would be the rookie record.\n\nReese keeps double-double streak alive ... barely\n\nThe Chicago Sky got back in the win column with a 78-69 triumph over the Atlanta Dream, and Rookie of the Year contender Angel Reese extended her historic double-double streak to 14 games in the process -- albeit in somewhat controversial fashion.\n\nWith 25 seconds to play, Reese somehow found herself wide open under the basket and scored a clutch bucket to push the Sky's lead up to five and essentially end the game. However, that basket only gave her nine points on the day, and as time ticked away a few possessions later it seemed her streak would end.\n\nThe Sky would not let that happen. After a few free throws and another miss by the Dream, the Sky had the ball up by seven with 10 seconds to play. Instead of running out the clock, they fed the ball inside to Reese, who was fouled and sent to the free throw line. She made both to get to double digits in scoring, much to the delight of the crowd.\n\nReese finished with 11 points, 13 rebounds, three steals and two blocks in another strong outing, and will maintain her league lead in the rebounding department over A'ja Wilson.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_maloney@cbssports.com", "name": "Jack Maloney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Ionescu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Ionescu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breanna_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breanna Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baltimore_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Baltimore Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiJonai_Carrington", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DiJonai Carrington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyasha_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyasha Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/10/c5eda0ef-1c55-4245-9a3f-ec480c172dde/thumbnail/1200x675/26b9cee771fa3c237bbe8093dc9a41fe/gettyimages-2160906777-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722372", "eventUri": "eng-9722372", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Those, however, are far from valid currency on the WNBA leaderboard, which now situates New York at the top next to the Connecticut Sun as the Olympic break approaches.\n\nIn the aftermath, point guard Sabrina Ionescu felt that Indiana hadn't stopped New York from playing \"Liberty basketball,\" but hinted that a sense of balance and adjustment would perhaps be necessary as the team starts to face familiar foes again.\n\n\"We played Liberty basketball, but (we had to understand) this is their Super Bowl game,\" Ionescu,she of a game-best 22 points, said of the futile attempt to take a four-game set from Indiana. \"We've beaten them three times this year already. We knew they were going to come into this game really hungry and it's tough to beat a team four times. Every team has grown, especially this young team.\"\n\n\"I don't think it was necessarily us not playing our style of basketball. It's just understanding that we had to come in with a sense of urgency knowing it's not going to be as easy as it was in the first couple of games that we were able to go up against them because they've just grown.\"\n\nMaintaining the necessary shooting discipline against recurring opponents is vital, and it'll come up big for the Liberty in the coming days: New York is due in Uncasville for a high-profile matinee against the Sun on Wednesday morning (11 a.m. ET, WWOR). Games against the Sun sandwich a home-and-home with the pesky Chicago Sky as part of the Liberty's remaining pre-Olympic quartet.\n\nWith that in mind, New York is set to seek a sense of balance in its shooting, which skewed toward the outside during Saturday's game.\n\nThe Liberty put up 42 three-pointers on Saturday, accounting for over 59 percent of their tries from the field. While Ionescu and Betnijah Laney-Hamilton hit four each, the rest of the team went 2-of-19 in eager attempts to swipe back momentum amidst Clark's history and Aliyah Boston's continued shake-up.\n\nThe performance made history of both the sentimental yet bittersweet variety: with her fourth and final, Ionescu is now tied for second on the Liberty's all-time triples list, united with Becky Hammon a 331 behind only Crystal Robinson (400). With 42 tries for an extra point, the 2024 Liberty also become the first team in WNBA history to have two games with at least 40 tries ... alas for Brooklyn, both have been losing efforts (also June 18 in Phoenix)\n\nCuriously, New York sought a dagger from deep despite hitting nearly two-thirds of their double attempts (19-of-29). The Liberty have proven well capable of engaging in shootouts, a natural phenomenon considering Ionescu's status as three-point royalty. But the expansion of Ionescu's game, which see her taking over 10 percent more two-point attempts as compared to last season, has propelled New York forward.\n\nSeafoam personnel vowed to use film study to re-open the two-point game, which has afforded New York a sense of discipline when it comes to deploying the three-point weapon.\n\n\"Defensively, (Indiana) is a much better team than when we faced them the first three times,\" head coach Brondello noted, hinting at another learning experience such as the one that previously allowed them to master the Minnesota Lynx. \"They were giving us open threes ... We probably settled a little too much but it was the shot that was open. But they were congesting, always scrambling, making it hard for us to score in the paint.\"\n\n\"Forty-two is a lot when you're not making any but we've got very capable shooters and it was one of those days where the ball wasn't going in the hole.\"\n\nBelieving that the excessive shooting could well be a case of good looks simply not falling, New York will also seek to investigate the expansive presence of Jonquel Jones, whose field performances have indirectly affected the Liberty's fate: including the Commissioner's Cup Final against Minnesota, the Liberty are 2-4 when she's held under 10 points (Jones was 2-of-5 for six on Saturday).\n\nBoth on and off-floor personnel expressed a desire to turn Jones' involvement into a team-wide effort, knowing how much her input can change the tide.\n\n\"JJ knows how important she is to us,\" Brondello said. \"We didn't get her established as much ... They were very active, even when she was on the front. She was probably a little hesitant. She missed a few shots there. We want her to be very decisive (when) she's open on the three, shooting or the next action. She'll respond in the right way ... wasn't at her best today but we know that she'll bounce back.\"\n\n\"It's about understanding that not every game is going to be the same,\" Ionescu noted. \"They were obviously taking away JJ, clogging up her roles, making it really difficult and shooters were open. I think it's about understanding what the defense is giving us and not trying to turn the ball over looking for something too hard, understanding that we've just got to continue to find different ways to try and get here open, because she's obviously really capable of dominating the paint but also spacing the floor.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"},

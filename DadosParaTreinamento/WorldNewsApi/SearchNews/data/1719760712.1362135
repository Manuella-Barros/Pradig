After weeks of testimony from more than 20 witnesses, the piercing glare of the legal spotlight now shifts firmly to the anonymous 12-member panel that holds Trump\u2019s fate in its hands. After receiving final instructions from the judge, the jury will retire to consider a verdict that \u2014 whichever way it goes \u2014 will have an outsized impact on Trump, and the country as a whole. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to reimburse a $130,000 payment to silence adult film actress Stormy Daniels, when her account of an alleged sexual encounter imperiled his 2016 presidential campaign. If Trump is found guilty, the political repercussions would far outweigh the seriousness of the charges as, barely five months before the presidential election, the candidate would also become a convicted criminal. In a full day of closing arguments on Tuesday, his defense team insisted the evidence for a conviction simply did not exist, while the prosecution countered that it was voluminous and inescapable. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s intent to defraud could not be any clearer,\u201d said prosecutor Joshua Steinglass, urging the jurors to use their \u201ccommon sense\u201d and return a guilty verdict. To return a guilty or not guilty verdict requires the jury to be unanimous \u2014 one holdout means a mistrial. If convicted, Trump faces up to four years in prison on each of 34 counts, but legal experts say that as a first-time offender he is unlikely to get jail time. A conviction would not bar him from the November ballot. \u2013 \u2018Hatred for Trump\u2019 \u2013 In its concluding remarks to the jury, the defense has painted star prosecution witness Michael Cohen as a convicted liar consumed by \u201coutright hatred for Trump.\u201d \u201cThere was no intent to defraud and beyond that there was no conspiracy to influence the 2016 election,\u201d said Trump\u2019s lawyer Todd Blanche. Steinglass countered that there was a mountain of corroborating evidence in addition to Cohen\u2019s testimony. Speaking to reporters before entering the Manhattan courtroom Tuesday, Trump called it a \u201cvery dangerous day for America.\u201d Trump chose not to testify in his defense. Instead, he used his trips to court to claim the trial is a Democratic ploy to keep him off the campaign trail. Polls show Trump neck and neck against President Joe Biden and the verdict will inflame passions as the White House race intensifies. In addition to the New York case, Trump has been indicted in Washington and Georgia on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election. He also faces charges in Florida of hoarding huge quantities of classified documents after leaving the White House. The New York case is the only one likely to come to trial by election day.", "summary": "<img width=\"275\" height=\"183\" src=\"https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jury-to-begin-deliberating-on-Trumps-fate-at-NY-trial.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" />NEW YORK (AFP): Jurors in Donald Trump&#8217;s hush money trial begin deliberating Wednesday on whether to return the first criminal conviction of a former president &#8212; a momentous decision that could upend the November presidential election.

Several EU member states are \u201cvery likely\u201d to follow the recent moves in that direction by Spain, Norway and Ireland, Sven Koopmans has told Haaretz. Koopmans, who has held the role since 2021, said that the coordinated recognition of a Palestinian state by the three nations last week has encouraged other EU member states to look \u201cvery closely\u201d into following suit and they are likely to take the same step soon. While emphasising that such decisions are made independently by member states, Koopmans noted that Europe was \u201cvery alarmed\u201d by certain statements and actions taken by the current Israeli government, including those against the two-state solution and in favour of eliminating the Palestinian Authority. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected outright the idea of the creation of an independent State of Palestine. The diplomat warned that Israel\u2019s continuation of its military operation in Rafah violates the International Court of Justice\u2019s order limiting fighting in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city. \u201cICJ orders are binding upon everyone, and the order was very clear,\u201d he told Haaretz. \u201cBut people are still being targeted. The suffering is unimaginable.\u201d Koopmans plans to convey to Israeli officials next week that their war in Gaza, which has killed over 35,000 Palestinians, mainly women and children, and caused a humanitarian crisis, is turning public opinion against the occupation state. He stressed that as the occupying power, Israel is responsible for ensuring the local population has enough aid to avoid starvation, despite Egypt\u2019s refusal to take aid into the enclave. The EU\u2019s position since the war began has been clear, Koopmans said: \u201cAll Israeli hostages must be released, with no conditions.\u201d He described their continued captivity as \u201cbeyond belief\u201d and called for an agreement including a ceasefire and the return of all hostages to end the war. During recent discussions with Arab foreign ministers, European countries were asked to recognise a Palestinian state officially. Koopmans said that Israel faces an opportunity for closer relations with these Arab countries, but must accept a framework for peace with the Palestinians to unlock it. \u201cWe\u2019re working with the Americans and the Arabs to prepare the ground. But then we hear the Israeli government saying, we don\u2019t believe in two states, there should not be a Palestinian state,\u201d he added, challenging opponents of the two-state solution to propose an alternative.

But with Jac Caglianone on their roster, Florida has to like their chances.\n\nThe Gators took on Kentucky in now their first elimination of the day. Florida came away with a 15-4 victory, knocking the Wildcats out of the tournament. In the process, Caglianone hit his 75th career home run. The longball set a new school record, breaking Matt LaPorta's previous record of 74.\n\nThe home run was a part of a massive day for Caglianone and the entire Gators offense. The first baseman/designated hitter went 2-for-2 at the dish with three walks and his home run. Florida as a whole used a seven run first inning and rode their early lead to the finish line.\n\nCaglianone's raw offensive power has been on full display throughout his past two seasons with Florida. In 2024, the slugger hit .414 with 33 home runs and 68 RBI. While his RBI total went down, Caglianone matched his home run high from 2023. Overall, he was a major boon for the Gators and a crucial reason why Florida is still around in the College World Series.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive part of Caglianone's record-breaking streak was the speed at which he achieved it. Heading into the College World Series, Caglianone had appeared in 162 total games over three seasons. Before the Kentucky game, he had 628 at-bats. LaPorta needed four seasons and more than 700 at-bats to reach his 74 dingers, h/t RJ Anderson of CBS Sports.\n\nWhile offense was the star of the show on Wednesday, Jac Caglianone has proven he can do it all for Florida. He also serves as a pitcher for the Gators and put up a 5-2 record with a 4.71 ERA and a 82/48 K/BB ratio. Come MLB Draft season, teams will be salivating over the idea of acquiring the next two-way sensation.\n\nBut for now, Caglianone and Florida are focused on the College World Series. After taking down Kentucky, they'll face off against Texas A&M in yet another elimination game. With their season on the line, Florida will be looking to Caglianone to once again help lead them to success.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_fappiano@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Dan Fappiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Gators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_LaPorta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt LaPorta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A&M_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas A&M University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home_Recording", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home Recording", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/7524806851.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665926", "eventUri": "eng-9665926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Part of that is because of his power. After all, during Florida's run in the College World Series, he became the program's all-time leader in home runs, with 75 for his career. Another part is the versatility that he offered Florida, both pitching and hitting very successfully during his career.\n\nWhile Caglianone does still have eligibility remaining in college, he's expected to be an early first round selection in the MLB Draft.\n\nJac Caglianone knows he's leaving a strong legacy at Florida. However, it's most important to him to be remembered for his effort, not his talent.\n\n\"Really just as somebody who gave it their all. Day-in and day-out, I just wanted to fight for these guys next to me,\" Caglianone said.\n\n\"Yeah, to be honest with you, I can't thank the coaches here enough for all they have done to help me get to where I am today.

Caglianone, batting leadoff and playing first base, went 2 for 2 and walked three times as part of a 15-4 trouncing.\n\nOne of those hits was a sixth-inning home run that put the Gators up by 12 and served as the 75th of his collegiate career. Take a look at the homer in all its moving picture glory:\n\nCaglianone had previously been tied for the Gators career home-run record with Matt LaPorta, himself a former top-10 pick. It's notable that LaPorta required four seasons and more than 700 at-bats to reach 74, whereas Caglianone entered the day with 628 collegiate at-bats. It's also notable that LaPorta was in attendance on Wednesday to give Caglianone his flowers.\n\nCBS Sports recently ranked Caglianone as the fifth-best player in this draft class. Here's what we wrote at the time:\n\nCaglianone is the most fascinating player in the class, a freak show talent denied a better ranking by transferability concerns. He features big-time power from the left side, resulting in 62 home runs and multiple 120-plus mph exit velocities over the last two seasons. He swings at everything, but his feel for contact is such that he kept his strikeout rate to an Arraezian 8%. Zone management is also an issue on the mound, where a bloated 15.7% walk rate obscured his ability to touch into the upper-90s. Because he profiles as just a reliever in pro ball, it's hard to see him remaining a two-way player all the way to the majors. In turn, that puts more pressure on his strength and bat-to-ball skills porting to the game's highest levels. There's a real chance that his approach deficiencies cause this whole thing to fall apart. But if he can make any kind of improvements on that front, he has the kind of unteachable skills that could allow him to develop into something along the lines of Yordan Alvarez with a walk allergy or a souped-up Anthony Santander.\n\nThe Gators will now advance to their second consecutive Men's College World Series semifinals.

The Gators star infielder put up staggering numbers with an OPS of 1.419, a .419 batting average, and an SLG of 875. In 248 at-bats spanning 66 games, Caglianone recorded 104 hits, scored 83 runs, had 72 RBIs, and hit 35 home runs. He was also feared by opposing pitchers, leading to the Gators star being walked quite often in his 316 plate appearances, which happened 58 times this season.\n\nAlthough Caglianone's time at Florida has come to an end, the Gators' star will forever be remembered. Shelnut and the rest of the Gators roster will always have the memories of who he was both on and off the field.

For him, he hopes that fans recall how all-in he was for his team and for their program.\n\n\"Really just as somebody who gave it their all,\" said Caglianone. \"Day-in and day-out, I just wanted to fight for these guys next to me.\"\n\nCaglianone thinks nothing in his time at Florida could have been possible without everyone else in the dugout with him.

And Florida's NCAA baseball party lasted a lot longer than any sober person would have imagined.\n\nLast call came shortly after 11 p.m. Wednesday, when Brody Donay hit into a double play to seal a 6-0 loss to Texas A&M. If he'd have gotten on, Jack Caglianone would have been the on-deck batter.\n\nIf Cags had gotten up, he might have hit 7-run homer to win the game.\n\nYeah, it would have been the first 7-run homer in baseball history. But if any player or team could have defied the laws of baseball, it was the 2024 Gators.\n\nJust three weeks ago, skeptics were ragging on the NCAA selection committee for inviting Florida to the big party. With a 28-27 record, UF was the worst of the 11 SEC teams that got in.\n\nThe Gators were a deepfake or cheap fake of a tournament team. Then the magical postseason mystery tour began.\n\nOklahoma State was 23-5 at home and hosting the Stillwater Regional. Florida won.\n\nMore: Brilliant career of Florida baseball two-way star Jac Caglianone ends short of goal in CWS\n\nClemson had lost only five games at home going into its Super Regional. Florida won.\n\nAfter that game, someone snapped a picture of Caglianone holding up the winner's trophy. He posted it on Instagram with a caption:\n\n\"tHeY dOn't bElOnG.\"\n\nI'm not sure what the weird capitalization signified, but the overall message was clear. Florida was officially in the Chip-on-Shoulder mode.\n\nIt was clich\u00e9d and predictable, but the effect was genuine. UF wanted to prove everybody wrong. And though he never said it, Caglianone must have wanted to prove this year's Golden Spikes Award is not exactly a 24-carat model.\n\nThe Spikes is college baseball's version of the Heisman, and the three finalists were announced before the tournament. A recount is now in order.\n\nGoing into Wednesday night's game, Caglianone was batting .438 with four doubles, six home runs and 14 RBI in the NCAA tournament. He'd walked 17 times, 13 of them intentional.\n\nOpponents all but refused to pitch to Caglianone. That prompted Kevin O'Sullivan to move Caglianone to the leadoff spot Wednesday morning for the first time in his career.\n\nCags promptly did a Rickey Henderson impersonation in the elimination game, going 2-for-2 with three walks and a stolen base. Oh yeah, he also hit a home run in the 15-4 blowout over Kentucky.\n\nIt was number 35 for the season, number 75 for the career. That broke the school record held by Matt LaPorta, who was in the crowd and tipped his hat to his long-ball successor.\n\nAll in a day's work for Cags.\n\n\"It is extremely difficult to be a player like Jac and have the whole world looking at you,\" O'Sullivan said. \"Maybe people don't quite understand the amount of pressure that's being put on him to perform day-in and day-out.\"\n\nPressure?\n\nMore: Florida baseball bats silenced in season-ending loss to Texas A&M in College World Series\n\nCaglianone had the most, but there was plenty to go around. The Gators won five elimination games before Wednesday night.\n\nPlayers who struggled all season started coming up clutch. Like Pierce Coppola, who'd never pitched more than 4.1 innings in a game before Wednesday.\n\nHe stuck out nine Wildcats in five innings. Donay had two homers, including a grand slam. The game bubbled with UF's esprit de corps.\n\n\"Just playing for each other was kind of our motto, and what we've been running with this postseason,\" Caglianone said. \"Despite all the ups and downs of the regular season, none of that matters now. And now it just kind of falls, next game, just leads into that.\"\n\nThe breakfast blowout led to the dinner rematch with Texas A&M. The Aggies won 3-2 in the CWS opener thanks to a homerun-saving catch in the 9 inning. There was no such drama Wednesday night.\n\nThe Gators struck out 14 times and were 1-for-12 with runners in scoring position. All those chips on the shoulder couldn't overcome Texas A&M's pitching.\n\nBut hey, the Aggies were the No. 2 seed and supposed to be in the CWS finale. They'll meet the No. 1 seed Tennessee in the showdown most anticipated.\n\nNobody anticipated UF would be the next-to-next-to last team standing. That made a forgettable season one to remember for Florida fans and cemented a legacy for this Florida team.", "source": {"uri": "eu.gainesville.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pensacola News

It was the 75th time he'd jogged carefree around the bases, a new career record for the Florida Gators baseball program. Caglianone is also closing in on the single-season hits record. With three more hits in the College World Series, he'll own that record, too.\n\nCaglianone, despite not being named a Golden Spikes Finalist, has been Florida's best player this season and one of the best players in the entire country. Not only does he lead the Gators in every major offensive category, as well as wins as a pitcher, but he's stepped his game up another level down the stretch when his team needed him most.\n\nSince the NCAA Tournament started, Caglianone is hitting .438 (14-32) with 16 runs scores, 4 doubles (more than he had the entire regular season), 6 home runs, 14 RBI and has been walked a staggering 17 times with 13 of those being intentional walks. He's also slugging 1.438 over that 10-game stretch.\n\nIn the College World Series, Caglianone is 5-8 with four runs scored, four RBI, one double, and two home runs. He's been walked six times with three of those free passes coming intentionally.\n\nOn Wednesday, Florida manager Kevin O'Sullivan moved Jac into the leadoff spot of the lineup. Caglianone went 2-2 with three walks and stole a base for fun.\n\n\"I had an idea given the track record of the last time we played Kentucky. Sully called me last night. I kind of knew where it was going. I was all in on it,\" Caglianone said. \"Swiped a bag showed off the wheels, I was kind of the lead-off guy that everybody wanted me to be. I kind of embraced the role today.\"\n\nWhen the Gators scouted and started to recruit Caglianone, it was mostly as a pitcher. Florida signed him after Caglianone had to undergo Tommy John surgery. The plan was to have him redshirt his first season but as the Gators struggled some in 2022, the Caglianone family and O'Sullivan decided to give Caglianone a chance to hit. He immediately belted a home run against Tennessee.\n\nWhile Caglianone is pulled every which way doing dozens of interviews this week and hundreds over the course of the season, he continues to shine the light back on his teammates, the coaches, and the team.\n\n\"He's an unbelievable athlete. And I think that the thing that really sticks out to me is everything he does and says and the answers he gives is all genuine. That's who he is,\" O'Sullivan said of Cags. \"Obviously we're all extremely happy for him with how he's performed this year. But this stuff that he says and to flex all the attention towards his teammates is what I'm most proud about.\"\n\nQ. Jac, first of all, congrats, record-breaking home run today. Obviously that's a big deal. Just after the ball left your bat on that home run, just what moment do you take, whether on the field or in the dugout (indiscernible)? What moment did it hit you that you had just become the all time home run hitters?\n\nJAC CAGLIANONE: In the dugout. Chuck gave me a hug, congratulated me, and Sully (lost audio) and stuff. And all the teammates followed. It kind of hit me there. It was really cool. In the moment I was just trying to help my team add more runs to the win.\n\nQ. In your last meeting with Kentucky, you mentioned that you were a bit frustrated with some of the so-called mind games that they played in the dugout. Just bearing that in mind did that add any extra motivation today to bring it harder than ever before, for lack of a better word?\n\nJAC CAGLIANONE: No extra motivation. They beat us at home in the weekend series. We knew we had to kind of get some sort of revenge, I guess. There's no better opportunity to do it than on this stage. All the guys were pretty pumped up about it.\n\nQ. Coach always has gone back to the Georgia series to kind of where this run has started. Any other specific moment, game that you kind of realized that this is clicking and this could be a special run?\n\nJAC CAGLIANONE: Probably after we lost that one game at Oklahoma State. We knew there were no second chances after that.\n\nThat was probably when everybody kind of bared down and knew what we had to do just to keep our season alive and get us where we are now.\n\nQ. Jac, what was it like hitting lead-off for, I believe, the first time in your career? Did you talk with the coaches about it and confer about it? And just your comfort level there and the decision there to have you bat lead-off?\n\nJAC CAGLIANONE: I had an idea given the track record of the last time we played Kentucky. Sully called me last night. I kind of knew where it was going. I was all in on it.\n\nSwiped a bag showed off the wheels, I was kind of the lead-off guy that everybody wanted me to be. I kind of embraced the role today.\n\nQ. What's it like being a part of this team? All of the answers that you guys have given, they've been humble and unselfish. There's records being broken, individual pitching performances. It all circles back to the team. What's it like being a part of a team like that?\n\nJAC CAGLIANONE: Yeah, I mean, it's everything. You know, I talked about it a little while ago. It's why you come to Florida. You have a great group of guys. You know there's talent top to bottom on the roster.\n\nAnd honestly, like the biggest thing is just playing for each other was kind of our motto and what we've been running with this postseason, despite all the ups and downs of the regular season. None of that matters now. And now it just kind of falls, next game, just leads into that.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

All that surging momentum came to an abrupt halt on Wednesday night. Hours after scoring 15 runs against Kentucky, the Gators' offense managed just four hits and left eight runners on base in a 6-0 loss to Texas A&M at Charles Schwab Field.\n\n\"It's really hard to put into words,\" O'Sullivan said. \"It's like you're going full speed in a sprint and all of a sudden it just comes to an end just like that.\"\n\nTwo-way All-American Jac Caglianone was the only Gator with multiple hits against the Aggies in the Gators' worst offensive game of the season.

Fisher Jameson scattered a run in 4.2 innings of relief. Reliable reliever Brandon Neely gave up two earned runs while striking out six in three innings. Jake Clemente and Luke McNeillie also pitched less than an inning.\n\nWith the loss, Florida fell a round shy of making the championship series for the second year in a row. Members of the team took solace in the run it took to get there.\n\n\"This whole year was pretty hard on all of us,\" senior Tyler Shelnut said afterwards. \"So being here was a huge accomplishment.\"", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brady_oltmans@orlandosentinel.com", "name": "Brady Oltmans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Gators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Sullivan_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin O'Sullivan (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Schwab_Field_Omaha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Schwab Field Omaha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaxSlayer_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TaxSlayer Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A&M_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas A&M University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_LaPorta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt LaPorta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CWS-Kentucky-Florida-Baseball-2-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665926", "eventUri": "eng-9665926", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Defensively, he's just a difference maker on that side of the ball. Just -- like he runs the bases really good.\"\n\nO'Sullivan noted a few moments from Florida's final games in Omaha to highlight just how impactful Caglianone is across the game.\n\n\"We were down I think five at one point, at that point of the game and he made the right decision not to tag, because his run did not matter when the ball's hit down the left field line,\" O'Sullivan said. \"He makes really good decisions.

The postseason magic finally ran out for the Gators, who entered the NCAA Tournament a game over .500 and reeled off five consecutive wins in elimination games until losing 6-0 to the Aggies on Wednesday night. Texas A&M starter Justin Lamkin dominated the Gators for the second time in the College World Series (CWS), this time tossing five shutout innings. He allowed three hits and struck out nine. Texas A&M (52-13) advanced to face Tennessee in the CWS championship series. The Gators close the season with a 36-30 record after winning eight of 11 games in the postseason. \"This time of year is difficult. It's really hard to put into words. It's like you're going full-speed in a sprint and all of a sudden it comes to an end, just like that,\" Florida head coach Kevin O'Sullivan said after the game. \"What they did is nothing short of remarkable. Go to Clemson, lose a really tough game on Saturday. We end up beating NC State by a run. Kentucky, another national seed. We accomplished an awful lot.\" The loss to Texas A&M marks the end of a historic career for Florida junior Jac Caglianone. The Plant High School grad had two hits in his last college game, giving him 104 for the season, tying the program's single-season record (Mark Kiger and Pat Osborn in 2002). The Tampa-native finished the season with .419 batting average, and his 35 home runs are a single-season record. His 75 career long balls are also a program record. \"I'm never going to take it for granted,\" Caglianone said when asked about what it meant to wear a UF jersey. \"All these guys who've worn it before us. All we try to do is just make them proud and really appreciate what Florida's about.\" At 6'5\", 250 pounds, Jac has all the physical tools to be a dominant player. But his teammates say he's grown as a leader ever since he came to Gainesviile. \"He's a terrific kid, and he's a great teammate. I think he truly does play for this team, and he truly does want to win,\" said outfielder Tyler Shelnut. \"I can't say enough about Jac, obviously, and what he's been able to accomplish.\" Caglianone, who finished with a 5-2 record as a pitcher and plays a solid first base, is considered the best two-way player in the country. He's arguably the best all-around player in Florida history, though he says he just wants to be remembered as someone who left it all out on the field, every day. \"Really, just a somebody who gave it their all. Day in, day out, I just wanted to fight for these guys next to me,\" he added. \"To be honest with you, I can't thank the coaches here enough for all they've done to help me get to where I am today. The people that I've met along the way and played with - it's something that I won't ever take for granted.\" Caglianone is projected to be a top-five pick when the Major League Baseball draft gets underway on July 14th.\n\n\"It's too much\"\n\nThe Citizens Property Insurance Corporation's Board of Governors voted to approve a new rate package for 2025 and ABC Action News Reporter Casey Albritton spoke to homeowners to get your voice on the rate hike.\n\nFlorida residents react to potential Citizens Insurance rate hike\n\nWNBA star Cameron Brink shares emotional message after tearing ACL\n\nElina Tarkazikis\n\n1:06 PM, Jun 20, 2024\n\nTiger Woods' son, Charlie, advances to first USGA event after winning qualifier\n\nGage Jackson\n\n12:25 PM, Jun 20, 2024\n\nMLB to honor Willie Mays during game at historic Negro League baseball stadium\n\nScripps News Staff\n\n9:06 AM, Jun 20, 2024\n\nRays stop Twins' winning streak at 6 with 3-2 victory in 10th\n\nAssociated Press\n\n11:29 PM, Jun 19, 2024", "source": {"uri": "abcactionnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFTS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_lewis@abcactionnews.com", "name": "Kevin Lewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Gators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A&M_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas A&M University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_O'Sullivan_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin O'Sullivan (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kiger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_B._Plant_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry B.

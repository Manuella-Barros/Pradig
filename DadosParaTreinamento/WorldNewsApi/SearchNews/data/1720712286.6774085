Last month, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex undertook a visit to the West African country to advance mental health initiatives for military personnel and inspiring youngsters while marking the 10 year anniversary of the Invictus Games. As part of their trip, the former Suits actress received a great honour as she was presented with the traditional Yoruba name 'Adetokunbo' by Olowo of Owo, the Yoruba King of Owo, the Express reports. Soon after, the duchess dispatched a letter where she said she will \"treasure\" the title which translates as 'the crown returns from over the sea', adding that she considers Nigeria as a \"home\" to her. In Meghan's words: \"Thank you for your warm welcome to Nigeria. I am deeply humbled by your blessing of the traditional Yoruba name, Adetokunbo. \"I treasure the name and appreciate your trust in me to carry it with grace and dignity. Our visit to Nigeria was important for many reasons, not least because it gave us an opportunity to explore and understand my heritage, which extends to our children. \"We look forward to coming back home one day soon.\" Join the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages. Meghan's comments stirred up mixed reactions among royal followers, with some throwing their support behind the duke's wife, while others were less enthusiastic. One internet user commented on X: \"It's cool that Meghan's embracing her Nigerian heritage. Representation matters, and it's nice to see someone in the spotlight acknowledging.\" Another follower, conversely, wasn't convinced: \"Embracing? Nah. Just attempting to be relevant.\" Someone else wrote: \"Good to know she loves Nigeria her made up homeland from whence she did not come. If H is told to exit the USA they can return to Nigeria as promised, where she can bond with her letter writing family of prince and princess's.(sic)\". Finally, a fourth person opined: \"Those who are confident and humble don't have to advertise their titles. Meghan Markle is pretentious and fake\".

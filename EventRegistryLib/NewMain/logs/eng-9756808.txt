According to the alert, operations at Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle, Orly and Beauvais airports could be affected. The notice, which has been put in place from 5am on Friday until 7am on Saturday, was issued due to wage demands.\n\nIn recent weeks, several unions called off strike action ahead of the Olympics, however, the FO union deemed the ADP's offer, of giving workers a \u20ac300 (\u00a3252) bonus as insufficient. Instead, the FO union are calling for the bonus rate to be increased to \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3841) as one of their main demands. However, a spokesperson for the union told AFP that it \"will operate its full programme of flights\" despite the strike.\n\nHowever, with fewer workers, flight chaos is expected as the airports of Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle and Orly record a daily influx of around 350,000 travellers. On top of strikes, holidaymakers will notice a \"temporary no-fly zone\" of 150 km placed around the capital for security reasons.\n\nIt has been reported that the notice will restrict air traffic from 6.30pm to midnight on the day of the ceremony. Unfortunately for sports enthusiasts, there will be other travel disruption on the same day as the opening ceremony. According to France 24, many metro stations will remain shut until Saturday, July 27, the day after. The country has encouraged people to use the 60km bike lane network instead to avoid further frustration.\n\nLast year, the French government announced its plans to spend more than one billion pounds to double the bike network. Olivier Schneider, president of the FUB cyclists union, said at the time: \"This visionary initiative will not only transform the way our citizens commute and live but also make France a global leader in promoting cycling infrastructure and culture.\" Transport Minister Clement Beaune earlier Tweeted: \"The state's bicycle effort is unprecedented and massive.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "monica_charsley@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Monica Charsley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Workers' Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adenosine diphosphate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_A\u00e9roport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris A\u00e9roport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orly_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orly Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauvais", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beauvais"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beauvais"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles de Gaulle Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cycling infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_France", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_24", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France 24"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaune", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beaune"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beaune"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation_Authorities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation Authorities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33304085.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILES-FRANCE-OLY-PARIS-2024-TOURISM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756808", "eventUri": "eng-9756808", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 345, "textEnd": 352}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 1600, "textEnd": 1607}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The formal announcement will take place from 05:00 on Friday until 07:00 on Saturday.\n\nMonday's strike notice comes after a strike by larger groups of workers was averted last week. Only \"partial and modest gains\" were offered, said the Force Ouvriere (FO) union. It represents almost 12 per cent of ADP's workforce.\n\nUnable to make any progress, the small union, operator ADP, formally threatened to strike on Friday, the day of the Olympic opening ceremony. It rejected the latest agreement with management, which it said was inadequate. Citing a \"feeling of dissatisfaction\" among workers, the strike notice was issued for 05:00 (04:00 GMT) on Friday until 07:00 on Saturday.\n\nAs Friday is the day of the opening ceremony, no civil flights will be allowed within a 150 kilometre (90 mile) radius of Paris between 18:30 and midnight. This will limit the potential impact of the strike. Many flights cannot be cancelled because they are not legally permitted. In these circumstances, ADP could not immediately comment on the impact of the FO strike.\n\nThe strike is over the union's demand for an increase in a bonus agreed last week from \u20ac300 to \u20ac1,000, as well as other wage increases. This has not been achieved, forcing the workers into this situation during the Olympic Games.\n\nThe FO's strike warning comes as smaller unions representing Air France pilots and cabin crew are also set to walk out this week to protest plans to leave Orly, one of the capital's three airports. The company \"will operate its full flight programme\" despite the strike, a spokesman told AFP.\n\nThe threat of strikes at Paris airports has been a constant this year. In May, a strike by air traffic controllers led to disruptions. The conflict was resolved. However, the threat is always there. With all the people arriving for the Olympics and those coming for holidays to the world's most visited city, the threat of strikes at airports is something that keeps the French authorities on their toes.\n\nAt the height of the summer, Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle and Orly airports handle around 350,000 passengers a day. This year, with the arrival of the Olympic Games, that number could increase significantly.\n\nThe air traffic controllers' strike in June was called off. This was due to the early national elections. France in general, and Paris in particular, have experienced tense moments due to strike warnings at airports, and now there is another one. Tensions remain high just days before the start of the Games.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karate@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Karate", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "marcos_menocal_pareja@insidethegames.biz", "name": "Marcos Menocal Pareja", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adenosine diphosphate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orly", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orly"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orly"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles de Gaulle Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://cdn.dmcl.biz/media/image/300247/l/ORLY+OPRTADA+23+JULIO+C.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756808", "eventUri": "eng-9756808", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

UK tourists heading to the European Union holiday hotspot to catch the Summer Olympic Games, which kicks off this week, have been warned.\n\nIt comes after the Force Ouvri\u00e8re (FO) union at A\u00e9roports de Paris (ADP) issued a strike notice in line with the opening ceremony on July 26. According to the alert, operations at Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle, Orly and Beauvais airports could be affected.\n\nThe notice, which has been put in place from 5am on Friday until 7am on Saturday, was issued due to wage demands. The FO union are calling for the bonus rate to be increased to \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3841) as one of their main demands.\n\nREAD MORE HMRC checking social media pictures to see if they 'tally' with how much tax you pay\n\nA spokesperson for the union told AFP that it \"will operate its full programme of flights\" despite the strike.

The country has encouraged people to use the 60km bike lane network instead to avoid further frustration. As a result during this time, no flights will land at Orly, Charles de Gaulle, or Beauvais airports, meaning even fewer passengers would be affected by the action.\n\nA strike that may be more disruptive is the one scheduled to be held by interpretive dancers set to perform during the opening ceremony.

The Olympic opening ceremony will be held Friday on the Seine, marking the first time the ceremony will be held outside a stadium in modern Olympic history.\n\nThe union initially raised its concerns in a June 7 statement, saying dancers had alerted it to contract conditions that they alleged broke the social charter signed by Paris 2024 organizers. A second statement released last week by the union said it was referred to the Olympic Social Charter Committee and it had held prior negotiations with Paris 2024 and Paname 24 on July 3 and 9.\n\nBefore Wednesday's agreement, tensions peaked Tuesday when the entertainment union federation to which SFA-CGT is affiliated announced it planned to maintain its strike notice after negotiations on Tuesday failed to reach a strike-ending agreement.\n\nThe entertainment union federation created an online fund Tuesday to financially support any performers who chose to strike.\n\n\"While the Olympic Games are heralded a great celebration, it has a bitter taste for all those artists who feel scorned and little considered,\" the statement attached to the fundraiser read in French.\n\nAlthough this dispute reached an agreement, ongoing strike notices from other sectors, including Paris airport workers and taxi drivers, continue to raise concerns for a country known for its labor strikes as the opening ceremony draws closer.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Dancers call off strike that threatened Olympic opening ceremony", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carrie_mcdonald@aol.com", "name": "Carrie McDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_notice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike notice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flagship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_metropolitan_area", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris metropolitan area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/F2sw_sQ4ubuDOKc70CsWKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_usatoday_us_articles_590/9ba6f495c9766616d606056c032a93e4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756808", "eventUri": "eng-9756808", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "dateEnd": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 2737, "textEnd": 2749}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 2410, "textEnd": 2416}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Adding to that challenge are thousands of workers across industries who are capitalizing on the high-attention moment to exercise their constitutional right to strike.\n\nEarlier this year, rail workers, police officers, and private security guards went on strikes to demand better pay and improved working conditions during the Olympics. Meanwhile, successful negotiations have managed some strike threats: the city's garbage collectors, who had gone on strike in May, lifted a strike notice that would have overlapped with the Olympics after Paris authorities granted them an increase in allowance during and after the Games. In an attempt to stave off further discontent -- and more strikes -- in March, French authorities offered a slew of Olympic-related incentives, including bonuses and time-off compensation, to government employees.\n\nHere's a look at some of the labor disputes that have continued through this week and may still affect the Paris Olympics, which takes place from July 26 to August 11:\n\nOn Monday, around 200 performers were seen standing along the Seine with their fists raised in defiance, refusing to take part in a rehearsal as an act of protest against working conditions and inequality in the treatment of entertainment workers at the Games.\n\nThe SFA-CGT, the largest union representing workers in the entertainment industry, announced last week that it had filed a strike motion for the Opening Ceremony on July 26 and for the upcoming rehearsals for the Paralympic Games Opening Ceremony, claiming that there were \"questionable practices, glaring inequalities in treatment, and a lack of social dialogue,\" during the preparation for the ceremonies. The announcement comes after unsuccessful negotiations between the union and Paris 2024 organizers earlier this month.\n\n\"Being remembered by the spectators will not allow them to make a living from their profession,\" said the statement, which pointed to stark differences in compensation between performers.\n\nAccording to SFA-CGT, around 300 entertainment workers were hired under \"shameful\" conditions and received only \u20ac60 for broadcasting rights compared to the \u20ac1,610 given to ballet dancers. On Tuesday, the union said organizers had offered a \"timid proposal\" of increasing the rate from \u20ac60 to \u20ac180, which it described as \"well below the artists' demands.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the SFA-CGT announced that the negotiations have led to a partial victory, including an increase in compensation, and they are calling off the protest.\n\nUnionized drivers in Paris are planning to stage a protest on July 26 and have filed a strike notice from July 26 to July 29, the opening weekend of the Games. They have been demanding the right to use reserved lanes in the city that are open to taxis but closed to private hire vehicles during the Olympics, as well as an \"Olympic bonus\" that has been granted to public transport workers.\n\nA number of unionized ground staff across Paris' major airports -- Charles de Gaulle (CDG), Paris Orly (ORY), and Paris-Le Bourget (LBG), all owned by the A\u00e9roports de Paris (ADP) group -- are planning to strike from 5 a.m. (local time) on July 2 to 7 a.m. on July 27.\n\nThe impending strike comes after a strike planned for July 17 was averted, following an agreement last week between ADP and union representatives to award bonuses to all airport staff during the Olympics period. While the other unions in the agreement have promised not to strike, the Workers' Force labor union, which represents 11.5% of ADP airport workers, said that the agreement was not satisfactory.

They want the bonuses to be increased to \u20ac1,000, among other pay demands.\n\nMajor disruption is not expected, as other unions have not joined FO's strike notice.\n\nThe impact of the strike will also be minimised by a no-fly zone, which will be in place from 6:30pm until midnight during Friday's Olympics opening ceremony to avoid disruption and improve security.\n\nDuring this period, airport landings will be suspended. Airlines have already cancelled flights ahead of time to respect the ban, and passengers have been informed and rerouted as necessary.\n\nParis is preparing to welcome over 15 million visitors during the Olympic Games between 29 July and 11 August.\n\nIf you're heading to the French capital, it will pay to plan your travel beyond the airport.\n\nAs many Olympic events will take place on the Seine river, various streets and bridges near iconic monuments such as Notre Dame will be closed, warns GuruWalk, which provides free walking tours of Paris and other cities.\n\nCheck the Paris City Hall website for the latest closures and disruptions, and the official Paris 2024 site for schedules and updates.\n\nYou'll also find a list of metro and tram closures on the RATP website. Be sure to plan your route ahead of time and leave extra time for travel by public transport to account for closures and crowds. Better yet, consider walking to your destination if it is only a short distance away.\n\nFinally, download alternative navigation apps for your trip to Paris, recommends Fabien Percuha, an experienced GuruWalk guide.

filed a strike motion for July 26, the date of the opening ceremony of the 2024 Olympics.\n\n********Give us your best tip for places to visit in and around Benidorm here - and you could win a \u00a3100 Amazon voucher*********\n\nThe Force Ouvri\u00e8re (FO) union represents 11.5 per cent of workers at airports operated by the A\u00e9roports de Paris (ADP) group, including Orly and Charles de Gaulle.\n\nThe walkouts are set to take place at both airports from 5am on July 26 until 7am on July 27.\n\nThe industrial action could cause big problems for anyone hoping to head to the French capital for the start of the Olympics.\n\nThe strikes are part of an ongoing dispute over pay for the airport staff members.\n\nThere's some good news for those heading to Paris is that the strikes aren't expected to have a big impact on travel.\n\nOther unions representing similar airport workers are not backing the strike, meaning it's only a small number of people participating.\n\nAccording to Connexion France, the ADP previously said that \"even major strike action of airport staff would not disrupt flights entering the city\".\n\nHowever, they also said that it could result in \"increased transit times through the airports\".\n\nThe Paris strikes are the latest to be held in Europe this summer, with others already causing problems.\n\nAnd Air Traffic Control (ATC) strikes could bring further delays to passengers at very short notice.\n\nConsumer champions Which? have warned passengers heading to France that some could be called at the last minute.\n\nHolidaymakers due to fly over or through France could also be affected, should ATC staff there decide on taking further action.\n\nThey said: \"In France, strikes are often announced last minute, so keep your eyes peeled.\n\n\"ATC strikes in France don't just affect journeys flying into and out of the country, they also affect flights travelling over French airspace. \"\n\nStrikes have taken place in Italy already this year, as recently as last weekend.\n\nAirport staff walked out on July 5 and July 21, but the country's transport sector is forbidden from striking between July 27 and September 5, meaning no further walkouts are expected.\n\nStrikes were due to take place at both London Gatwick and two airports in Scotland, including Glasgow and Aberdeen.\n\nAround 300 security and passenger services staff were due to walk out from the London airport, while a similar number also threatened to strike across the Scottish transport hubs.\n\nHowever, both have since been called off.\n\nA public transport strike is set to take place in the Netherlands' biggest cities on September 12, while more walk outs are possible.\n\nServices in Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam are all due to be impacted.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_gray@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Ryan Gray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

The union demands a fairer distribution of airport profits, primarily seeking a pay increase in dissatisfaction with a July 16 agreement. In addition to the airport ground staff, pilot and cabin crew unions at Air France also plan to strike.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Paris Olympics, the aviation sector is preparing for an influx of arriving passengers over the next few days. In addition, though, strike action is also expected to intensify the job of airport authorities and staff as airline and airport unions announce plans to stop working.\n\nThis week, a minority union representing ground staff workers at the three Paris' airports including the main one, Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), revealed its intention to strike on none other than the opening day.\n\nPhoto: Ryken Papy | Shutterstock\n\nStrike action was always a concern in the lead up to the Olympics, as strong civil society organisations (notably unions) continue to show their weight in French decision making. Compared to other countries in the region, strike action is much more common in France as a measure called upon to push for demands that often involve pay and working conditions.\n\nForce Ouvri\u00e8re announces strikes\n\nThe Force Ouvri\u00e8re (FO) or 'Workers Force' labor union has announced its intention to strike on the opening day of the Paris Olympics. The action could cause disruption at the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle (CDG), Orly (ORY), and Le Bourget (LBG) airports. FO is a minority union, having received 11.57% of the votes in the last elections.\n\nOn Monday, FO announced that it would be striking as it was disappointed and not satisfied with the agreement signed on July 16 between the majority of unions and the airports' operator Groupe A\u00e9roports de Paris (ADP).\n\nIt says it plans to strike as of 05:00 on July 26, ending the industrial action at 07:00 the following day on July 27. The Paris Olympics opening ceremony is on July 26. In a statement declaring its intention to strike, the Union said the July 16 agreement \"generated a strong feeling of discontent\".\n\nIn order to lift the action, the union's demands primarily include an increase in pay. In an interview with BFM TV, Union Secretary Fabrice Criquet said:\n\n\"It is up to the [airport] management to respond to our demands in the interests of the Olympics Games. What are our demands? Well it's very simple, it's a fair distribution of the riches produced by the Paris airports that are [currently] distributed in a disproportionate way between the stakeholders - of which the state owns a majority - and staff.\"\n\nHe noted that it has been months now since FO has attempted to enter into negotiations to discuss its demands, but to no avail.\n\nStrikes at Air France\n\nStrikes are also to be expected on the airline side, with pilot union Alter also having announced a strike at ORY to protest Air France's deicison to ultimately leave the airport and move its operation completely to CDG with certain exceptions. The union argues that nearly a thousand jobs are to be affected by the move. They are currently on strike, having begun on July 22 with a planned end for July 25.\n\nPhoto: pio3 I Shutterstock\n\nLow-cost carrier Transavia was expected to pick up many of the routes dropped from ORY, but the union argues this is not happening fast enough.\n\n\"Transavia does not have the means to take up these routes in the anticipated timeline, growth is therefore only achieved through the use of charters from companies practicing social dumping.\"\n\nA cabin crew union at Air France will also be striking, for the same reason. The industrial action will take place from July 23 to July 29. Air France says that despite the strikes it can continue to guarantee the totality of its flight program, meaning the impact is very much limited.\n\nGet all the latest aviation news right here on Simple Flying\n\nIn October, Air France had announced it would be leaving ORY due to a fall in demand, shifting the majority to CDG. Only flights to Corsica would remain. It has just over 400 employees operating from ORY.\n\nParis airspace already closed\n\nStrikes here, there, and everywhere. A very unstable situation indeed for Paris' aviation sector in the lead-up to the Olympics. A pre-planned closure of the airspace the day of the opening ceremony is also set to enter into force on Friday evening.\n\nRelated How Will The 2024 Olympic Games Operationally Impact Paris' Major Airports?\n\nStrikes, more flights, and the 'no-fly zone' around Paris: here's all you need to know about the impact of the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\n5\n\nA no-fly zone roughly the size of neighboring Belgium will be established on July 26. Flights over all of Paris' airports are therefore banned from 18:30 to midnight local time. Authorities say this is for security reasons to allow the opening ceremony to take place as planned on the Seine river.\n\nPhoto: Markus Mainka | Shutterstock\n\nAs airlines had already been informed, schedules were adapted well in advance, meaning there would be no last-minute cancellations due to the no-fly zone.\n\nParis Charles De Gaulle AirportIATA/ICAO Code: CDG/LFPG Country: France CEO:

European Union holidaymakers have been warned over strikes at airports which could cause disruption and chaos.\n\nIn France the strikes are due to take place at both Orly and Charles de Gaulle. A union representing 11.5 per cent of airport staff at both airports. The walkouts are set to take place at both airports from 5am on July 26 until 7am on July 27.\n\nAccording to Connexion France, the ADP previously said that \"even major strike action of airport staff would not disrupt flights entering the city\". However, they also said that it could result in \"increased transit times through the airports\".\n\nREAD MORE Credit card holders warned 'pay contactless' and told 'never enter card'\n\nConsumer champions Which? have warned: \"In France, strikes are often announced last minute, so keep your eyes peeled. ATC strikes in France don't just affect journeys flying into and out of the country, they also affect flights travelling over French airspace. \"\n\nThere are also strikes in Italy where airport staff walked out on their jobs on two separate dates in July. A public transport strike is set to take place in the Netherlands' biggest cities on September 12, while more walk outs are possible.\n\nServices in Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam are all due to be impacted. Which? added: \"The good news is that if you're travelling in or out of Italy on peak summer dates, you won't get caught up in strike disruption. Industrial action impacting Italy's air transport sector is not permitted between 27 July and 5 September.\"\n\nIt went on: \"If Border Force staff strike at ports, allow extra time as queues at the UK border in France will likely be longer than usual. It's worth packing extra water and food, especially for those passengers driving, as you may be stuck in your car for an extended period. Make sure your phone is charged and you can access roaming, as you may need to rebook an alternative crossing via an app or website.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rodger@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "James Rodger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orly_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orly Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles de Gaulle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Which?", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Which?"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contactless payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation_Authorities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation Authorities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/article29605453.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_airport.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756808", "eventUri": "eng-9756808", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "dateEnd": "2024-09-05", "textStart": 1744, "textEnd": 1767}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 574, "textEnd": 581}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 595, "textEnd": 602}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-12", "textStart": 1392, "textEnd": 1404}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Workers are demanding free healthcare.\n\nOn the same day, PSNA union members in rehab agencies rallied in the evening. They plan to walk out the day the bill is passed in parliament.\n\nThe bill proposes the closure of two of the country's three remaining psychiatric hospitals, Attica Psychiatric Hospital and Thessaloniki Psychiatric Hospital as well as drug Prevention Centres, reported efsyn.\n\nPsychiatrist Roulas Georgiadis from the Psychiatric Hospital of Thessaloniki was recently sacked for an \"administrative omission\" after addressing a strike rally July 16 opposing the bill.\n\nThe ND government has just introduced a six-day working week after over a decade of austerity including that implement by Syriza (Coalition of the Radical Left) which was in power from 2015-19.\n\nDoctors walk out in Portugal for higher pay\n\nDoctors in Portugal went on a 48-hour national strike from July 23 over pay and conditions. They are implementing an overtime ban in primary healthcare until August 31.\n\nThe National Federation of Doctors members, among the worst paid in Europe, want the 35-hour week reinstated, a revised pay scale and restoration of 25 days annual leave with pay.\n\nThe government has postponed negotiations until 2025 and refuses to address the shortage of doctors. Waiting times in emergency department are interminable, and as paediatric and obstetric emergency rooms are often closed, patients must travel many kilometres to get treatment.\n\nFrench unions firefighting industrial unrest ahead of Olympic Games\n\nStrikes over pay, conditions and bonuses continue to threaten the Paris 2024 Olympic Games which open this week, despite conciliatory efforts by unions. The Games Organising Committee (Cojo) has called for a social truce.\n\nThe CGT union's Sophie Binet warned of the need for negotiations \"to avoid strikes,\" while Marylise L\u00e9on of the CFDT told media the union would not use the Games to get \"things it would not have had otherwise.\" Spokesperson Pascal Lagrue insisted Force Ouvri\u00e8re (FO) was not observing an Olympic truce, before admitting that there were no calls for striking at an inter-union level.\n\nThe result has been firefighting by the unions to call off actions even while admitting the settlements \"could have been better,\" as in the \"majority agreement\" at Aeroports de Paris (ADP) last week. The CFDT, CFE-CGC and CGT unions all agreed to a uniform 300 euro bonus to be paid to all ADP employees in September.\n\nFO subsequently issued a strike call for its members at ADP, demanding the bonus be raised to 1,000 euros and other wage concessions.\n\nEmergency workers at Georges-Pompidou Hospital are on a rolling strike, demanding a 2,000 euro weekly bonus for all mobilised workers whatever their status.\n\nThe SFA-CGT union has called off a proposed strike over pay and conditions by performers at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games on July 26. The strike would also have affected rehearsals for the opening ceremony of the Paralympics on August 28. Some 3,000 dancers, musicians and actors are involved in the Olympics opening ceremony. Dancers staged a protest during the dress rehearsal on Monday 22, freezing mid-pose with fists raised.\n\nThe strike was called over what the union called the \"shameful\" employment conditions of some dancers. The union called off the strike having won what it admits was \"not a total\" victory.\n\nThis saw an increase in the associated rights paid to the dancers because of the television broadcast of the event. This was revised to match the fee, which was not increased. Category 2 dancers, who do not appear very much will now be paid 200 euros gross pay and 200 euros in associated rights, up from 40 euros. The more central Category 1 dancers will receive 300 euros gross pay and 300 euros in associated rights, up from 60 euros.\n\nThe settlement does not address the question of travel and accommodation costs for artists from outside the Paris area, which was noted as one of the main issues in their exploitation.\n\nWhile some bonuses have been obtained for workers in Paris, workers elsewhere have not benefited. Firefighters in Lyon, where the Olympic football matches will be held, began a strike July 24, to run until the end of the Games on August 11. They are demanding \"real compensation\" for their work during the Games. They have been offered an insulting flat-rate bonus of 200 euros and have been told to book only two weeks' holiday rather than their usual three.\n\nR\u00e9my Chabbouh of the union representing firefighters in Rh\u00f4ne and Lyon said that workers in five d\u00e9partements outside Paris are in the same situation. Firefighters in Seine-et-Marne, Nord and Pas-de-Calais are also considering strike action. Firefighters in Paris will receive a 1,600 euro bonus, while Paris area police will get 1,900.\n\nThe demand for bonuses equivalent to those received in Paris has also seen strike action on Lyon transport systems. On July 24, the city's tram network was at a standstill to target the football stadium.\n\nWorkers at Istanbul food factory strike in defence of colleagues sacked for joining union\n\nWorkers at the Polonez factory in \u00c7atalca, Istanbul are striking in defence of 25 colleagues sacked for joining the Tekg\u0131da-\u0130\u015f union.\n\nThe company has attempted to prevent unionisation of workers with 10 years' seniority by offering salary increases and bonuses. Workers were dismissed on what one called \"disgraceful slanders,\" including theft. Some were also told the company was downsizing.\n\nPolonez, which produces meat products for chains like CarrefourSA and Migros, hired subcontracted untrained labour to replace the victimised workers. One sacked worker, Nuh Kaya, told press the company had \"hired 150 unregistered workers who did not know the job and had no hygiene training.\"\n\nThe workers also say the factory is not inspected, and the conditions mean the meat in the factory \"smells and turns green.\"\n\n24-hour strike by transport workers in Antwerp, Belgium\n\nA 24-hour strike saw only half the bus and tram services running in the region of Antwerp, Belgium. Workers took the action on July 11 in protest at proposed changes by De Lijn to working conditions and the journeys drivers must undertake. A De Lijn spokesman dismissed these as purely practical concerns.\n\nFertiliser workers' strike in Amsterdam called off after new offer\n\nA strike at ICL Fertilizers in Amsterdam over pay and safety conditions has been called off following a new offer from the company.\n\nAround 100 workers, members of the CNV union, were demanding an improved agreement, calling for an increase of 6.5 percent and a fixed raise of 100 euros per month.\n\nThey were also using the strike to denounce pressure of work and dangerous conditions in the factory. A warehouse roof collapsed at the factory recently. \"Fortunately there were no casualties,\" said CNV's Alptekin Akdogan, \"but management refuses to put that in writing.\"\n\nThe company offered only 4.5 percent and refused to commit to investment. The workers, said Akdogan, \"were completely done with it\" and began weeks of action. After a 24-hour strike in June, they came out for two days a fortnight ago.\n\nThe company has now revised its offer, with a 4.5 percent increase backdated to March 1 and a further 1.5 percent from January 1, 2025. There will also be an option of reduced hours for older workers, as well as 8 million euros invested in safety.\n\nAkdogan claimed this as \"a very important victory\" for the workers, but this year ICL will only pay their original offer. The union is citing the combined offer as 6 percent, but this is still below the workers' initial demand.\n\nGarbage workers in month-long pay strike in A Coruna, Spain\n\nAfter a month-long strike by garbage workers in A Coruna, Spain, mayor Ines Rey declared a health emergency. The workers walked out to demand \"fair increase\" in salaries.\n\nThe council will hire a different company to shift the huge piles of rubbish accumulating, the stipulation being it must have 13 vehicles and 32 operators.\n\nFirefighters were called to extinguish fires in containers. The STL union denied their members were to blame, reported Galici@Press.\n\nGardeners at Vigo City Council in Spain continue indefinite strike over index-linked pay rise\n\nGardeners employed by outsourced company Green Zones UTE on behalf of Vigo City Council in Spain are continuing their pay strike, begun July 15.\n\nOf the 110 workforce, 90 percent are out. The workers say the company reneged on a recent agreement to give them a pay rise in line with the consumer price index, Europa Press reports.\n\nAs garbage begins to mount in green areas and on the beach, the Popular Party of Vigo urged mayor Abel Caballero to mediate between the company and workforce, fearing the strike will impact tourism.\n\nState daycare workers' dispute continues in Berlin, Germany over staff shortages but unions delay strike ballot\n\nAfter 13 days of warning strikes, including a week-long stoppage, the state daycare workers' dispute in Berlin over staff shortages continues.\n\nWorkers are demanding an end to staff shortages and better staff training to improve quality of care and end high staff turnover. The Verdi and GEW union, however, have deferred a ballot for strike action, which requires 75 percent to go ahead, until the beginning of September.\n\nThe state-run daycare centres, which have 35,000 children in their charge, comprise ten percent or about 290 of the 2,900 daycare centres in Berlin.\n\nAcademic staff at Goldsmiths University, London strike over redundancy threat\n\nAcademic staff at Goldsmiths University in the UK capital began a week-long strike Monday.\n\nThe University and College Union (UCU) members oppose plans by the university to impose redundancies, including its Black British literature course. Originally 130 posts were due to go, since reduced to 97.\n\nUCU members are also imposing a marking boycott, begun June 3, and are asking academics not to apply for posts at the university, give lectures there or take part in conferences arranged at the university.\n\nUniversities throughout England are planning redundancies as they respond to a major funding crisis, with a third said to be in difficulty -- due to Brexit and restrictions preventing overseas students from bringing their partners and children.\n\nWhile some universities may have to close, Labour Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said they should manage their own budgets and not look for a taxpayer bailout.\n\nStrike of bus workers in southwest England over pay\n\nOver 300 bus workers employed by First South West in England began a 48-hour strike Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union members rejected a derisory pay offer for drivers. Other grades including cleaners, clerical staff, engineers and supervisors were offered no rise. Also, the proposed rise for drivers was dependent on trading terms and conditions.\n\nPicket lines were set up at bus depots and bus stations across the First South West area, including Falmouth, Penzance, Taunton, Truro and Yeovil.\n\nFurther stoppages are planned for August 9 and 12, with an overtime ban to follow this week's walkout until those in August.\n\nAccording to the RMT, the parent First Group company's latest pre-tax profits were \u00a3139 million, up by a third on the previous year. Its proposed dividends for this year are up by nearly 50 percent.\n\nStrike by veterinary staff over pay in South Wales enters second week\n\nThe strike by around 100 veterinary staff working for Valley Vets in South Wales, begun July 16, has entered its second week. Valley Vets is part of the VetPartners group.\n\nThe British Veterinary Union (BVU) members rejected a derisory pay deal, effective from April 2024. The BVU is a branch of the Unite union. They are employed as veterinary surgeons, nurses, animal care assistants and receptionists.\n\nThe stoppage is the first by veterinary workers employed in private practice. The strikers are providing emergency cover throughout the stoppage.\n\nAnnouncing the strike, Unite noted, \"Valley Vets has offered its lowest paid staff a derisory pay rise that takes them to slightly above the minimum wage. This is despite 80 per cent reporting that they regularly borrow money to meet basic living costs and five per cent reporting having to use food banks.\n\n\"Meanwhile, higher paid workers have been offered increases of between one and 1.5 per cent from April 2024. The offer is a real terms pay cut as the RPI rate of inflation was 3.3 per cent when the deal was due to be implemented.\"\n\nUnite said VetPartners made gross profits of over \u00a3550 million in 2023, an increase of over \u00a3100 million on the previous year. VetPartners acquired around 100 practices in the last financial year. It is owned by private equity company BC Partners, which has a North American and European wide portfolio worth \u00a3138 billion.\n\nWith the increasing gobbling up of small and independent vet practices by big corporate entities, the BVU has become the fastest growing Unite union branch.\n\nUnite union calls off planned strike by light rail system workers in Manchester, England pushing through pay offer workers previously rejected\n\nA three-day stoppage by around 600 UK workers employed by the Manchester Metrolink light rail system due to begin Thursday has been called off by the Unite union.\n\nWorkers accepted a new pay offer negotiated by the union. While the deal was sold by the union as a \"substantial\" rise, 14 percent over three years, this is just 4.46 percent a year. The workers, employed in business support, customer service, drivers and engineer, had rejected a previous 4.5 percent pay offer, arguing it did not make up for years of below-inflation pay rises.\n\nA Unite press release outlined the offer: \"Customer service representatives at the bottom of the pay scales will see a minimum pay increase of 14 per cent over the next three years and those at the top of their pay scales will receive a minimum of nine per cent.\"\n\nAs a sweetener, drivers will be able to move up to the top of the pay scale within three years rather than the current four years.\n\nMiddle East\n\nSaturday saw protests by nurses at the Moheb Kausar hospital in Iran's capital Tehran against the firing of nurses. The same day medics protested outside the Governorate office in the Kurdish city of Ilam. They were protesting arrears of wages and benefits.\n\nThe wave of protests over working and social conditions is continuing. On Tuesday, Tehran saw a demonstration by residents of the city outside the city council building. They were protesting ongoing encroachments of the city's parks with trees being uprooted.\n\nWomen prisoners in Karaj and Tehran protested that day as part of ongoing \"No to Execution Tuesday\" demonstrations against the death penalty and torture. Prisoners at another 16 prisons joined in with hunger strikes.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the city of Yasuj in the southwest of the country saw women from surrounding villages protesting the ongoing water outages.\n\nIn Tabriz in northwest Iran, Shaskam Telecommunications Company employees held protests over wage arrears the same day. In Pars Abad Moghan Agro-Industrial workers protested the running of the company and called for the resignation of the CEO.\n\nIn Shiraz in central Iran, university medical students protested over being used as cheap labour and at poor education standards.\n\nThe economy is collapsing, exacerbated by US sanctions, with an inflation rate of 35 percent. President Masoud Pezeshkian favours rapprochement with the US. None of the competing factions, however, can answer US war plans against Iran, part of NATO's widening wars in the Middle East, against Russia in the Ukraine and ultimately China.\n\nAfricaMoroccan doctors and nurses strike at government-run hospitals\n\nMoroccan doctors and nurses belonging to eight different unions at government-run hospitals began a five-day strike on July 22.\n\nPolice previously dispersed a July 10 protest held by doctors and nurses demanding a pay rise in front of the parliament building in the capital, Rabat.\n\nLast week, the government announced a monthly increase to the wages of health sector workers, but this did not make up for the rising cost of living.\n\nMorocco is suffering from rising inflation, high unemployment and is highly indebted.\n\nHundreds of casual municipal workers in Durban, South Africa protest for permanent contracts\n\nMore than 300 Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) workers with the eThekwini municipality, South Africa have been demonstrating daily outside Durban city hall since July 19 in protest at summary redundancies and to demand permanent employment.\n\nThe Municipal and Allied Trade Union of South Africa workers are employed on month-to-month rolling contracts, some for more than 10 years, but now their contracts will not be renewed even though the municipality is hiring other people to do their work.\n\nThe EPWP is a discredited African National Congress government scheme in which previously unemployed people are exploited in temporary public sector jobs but without the salary or benefits given to permanent employees.\n\nSouth African government employees strike over pay and employment changes\n\nTwo hundred workers employed by the South African Bureau of Standards went on indefinite strike Monday, holding demonstrations daily outside the statutory body's headquarters in Pretoria.\n\nThe National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union members are responsible for testing the safety, quality, and reliability of products and services across the country.

of Nigerian students from the Federal College of Education in Akoka, Lagos, protested the dilapidated buildings used as medical facilities, sports amenities and hostels.\n\nThe protesters complained

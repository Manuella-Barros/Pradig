Newsom touted that his administration has spent roughly $24 billion aimed at cleaning up streets and housing people but acknowledged the stubbornness of the issue. Newsom's administration has also come under fire recently after a state audit found that the state didn't consistently track whether the huge outlay of public money actually improved the situation.\n\nNewsom has worked hard to address the issue.

Harris entered the race over the weekend after President Joe Biden's announced that he would not seek reelection. Newsom himself has presidential ambitions.\n\nThe timing of the executive order is \"curious,\" said California political analyst Brian Sobel, but he doubts Newsom's move would have much impact on Harris' campaign.\n\n\"Harris' problem isn't in California, because California is a done deal,\" he said. \"Where she needs to do well on issues like this are in swing states.\"\n\nRather, the order is a logical step for Newsom, who called himself the state's \"homeless czar\" and made homelessness a signature policy issue the last few years, said Wesley Hussey, a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento.\n\n\"I don't think it's being motivated by the presidential race as much as it's definitely something that Newsom cared a lot about,\" Hussey said. \"If you're going to put it in a political context of the election, this isn't going to magically fix the problem.\"\n\nNewsom's decision have garnered praises from local elected officials and business groups, who said they were left with no options to address homeless encampments before the Supreme Court's ruling. San Francisco Mayor London Breed recently said the city will start an \"aggressive\" campaign to clear encampments across the city in August. Her office noted that the governor's order does not affect the city's operations.\n\n\"I applaud Governor Newsom's emphasis on urgency,\" Kathryn Barger, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors said in a statement. \"He rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals. Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by County government.\"\n\nHomeless people and their advocates say the sweeps are cruel and a waste of taxpayer money. They say the answer is more housing, not crackdowns.\n\nUnder Newsom's direction, state agencies - including state parks and department of transportation - would be required to prioritize clearing encampments that pose safety risks, such as those camping along waterways.

Gavin Newsom orders sweep of homeless encampments", "body": "The order from California Governor Gavin Newsom would direct state agencies on how to remove thousands of tents and makeshift shelters across the state.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO - The homeless encampments that have joined the Golden Gate Bridge and Hollywood sign as recognizable features of the California landscape will soon be swept away if Gov. Gavin Newsom has his way.\n\nArmed with last month's Supreme Court decision allowing cities and states to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public areas, Newsom directed agencies Thursday to clear out the encampments that have proliferated in the state's urban centers, most noticeably in San Francisco, Los Angeles and the capital city of Sacramento. Authorities would have to provide a two-day notice before taking action.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court's ruling on the Grants Pass case, a lower court's decision had thwarted municipalities' efforts to remove encampments.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them - and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,'' Newsom said in a statement. \"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets. There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.''\n\nNewsom can't dictate what local governments do regarding homeless encampments, but he can apply pressure through the power of the purse, granting or withholding funding.\n\nWith a seemingly intractable housing shortage and some of the highest housing costs in the nation, California has long been contending with homelessness, an issue that has become more prominent with the emergence of encampments and is often used by Republicans to bash the deep-blue state.\n\nIn a December 2023 report to Congress, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development said California had 181,000 of the country's estimated 653,000 homeless people, or more than 27%. The state's population of 39 million represents just under 12% of the national total.\n\nHomeless advocates have argued that banning people from sleeping outside criminalizes their inability to find a home. In her dissent on the Grants Pass ruling, Justice Sonia Sotomayor called punishing someone for being homeless \"unconscionable and unconstitutional.''\n\n\"Sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime. For some people, sleeping outside is their only option,\" she said.\n\nSan Francisco's Coalition on Homelessness issued a statement in response to Newsom's executive order, saying: \"Previous attempts to evict people living in encampments have failed to reduce the number of people forced to sleep outside in our state. Displacing, destabilizing and dispossessing people without real offers of permanent housing makes homelessness worse.''\n\nNewsom's office said that under his leadership the state has spent more than $24 billion in homeless and housing reforms, including more than $1 billion to address homeless encampments. Now he wants to see them removed.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything more urgent and more frustrating than addressing the issue of encampments in the state of California,'' Newsom said in a video. \"It's time to move with urgency at the local level to clean up these sites.''", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Sign", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood Sign"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Gate Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_the_purse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power of the purse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Housing and Urban Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/30/USAT/73913331007-s-fhomeless-2.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5229,2943,x0,y271&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom is ordering state agencies to begin sweeping homeless encampments on public property, using newfound authority after the U.S. Supreme Court's OK in an Oregon case last month.\n\nIn an executive order, the governor directs agencies to remove encampments that pose a risk to \"life, health and safety.\"\n\nThe order could impact tens of thousands of people living in tent encampments across California. The latest count showed roughly 180,000 people in the state were living without shelter on any given night.\n\nThe Newsom administration has invested $24 billion in recent years to try to shrink that number but it has only grown.\n\nNewsom's order is aimed at the thousands of tents and makeshift shelters across the state that line freeways, clutter shopping center parking lots and fill city parks. The order makes clear that the decision to remove the encampments remains in local hands.\n\nThe order comes after a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this summer allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces. The case, which arose from Grants Pass, was the most significant on the issue to come before the high court in decades and comes as cities across the country have wrestled with the politically complicated issue of how to deal with a rising number of people without a permanent place to live and public frustration over related health and safety issues.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nWhile Newsom cannot order local authorities to act, his administration can apply pressure by withholding money for counties and cities.\n\nIn Oregon, a state law passed in 2021 requires that local rules regulating where people experiencing homelessness can sit, lie or sleep outdoors on public property must be \"objectively reasonable\" in their \"time, place and manner.\" Courts have not yet ruled on what is \"objectively reasonable\" under the law, which muted any effect of the Supreme Court decision on Portland's current practices.\n\nCalifornia is home to roughly one-third of the nation's population of homeless people, a problem that has dogged Newsom since he took office. Newsom touted that his administration has spent roughly $24 billion aimed at cleaning up streets and housing people but acknowledged the stubbornness of the issue. Newsom's administration has also come under fire recently after a state audit found that the state didn't consistently track whether the huge outlay of public money actually improved the situation.\n\nNewsom has worked hard to address the issue. He threw all of his political weight behind a ballot measure earlier this year to allow the state to borrow nearly $6.4 billion to build 4,350 housing units, which passed with a razor-thin margin.\n\nThe order comes as Republicans have stepped up their criticisms of California and its homelessness crisis as Vice President Kamala Harris -- a former California district attorney, attorney general and senator -- launches her presidential campaign. Harris entered the race over the weekend after President Joe Biden's announced that he would not seek reelection. Newsom himself has presidential ambitions.\n\nUnder Newsom's direction, state agencies -- including state parks and department of transportation -- would be required to prioritize clearing encampments that pose safety risks, such as those camping along waterways. Officials should give advance notice to vacate, connect homeless people to local services and help store their belongings for at least 60 days. Local cities and counties are urged to adopt similar protocols.\n\nThe order urges agencies to provide at least 48 hours notice before clearing an encampment and to label and store any personal belongings collected during the sweep for at least 60 days.\n\n--Tribune News Service and The Associated Press contributed", "source": {"uri": "oregonlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oregon Live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/VDCPRFKTBBBUZJUTOMXWXMF6HU.jpg?auth=d9b1f3b6f34a2d603b844e858406b8957b2b0cb633e0a6a9cc7edc1f2565294d&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Local cities and counties are urged to adopt similar protocols.\n\nMore from this section\n\nInformative Research Enhances Verification Platform through Expanded Integration with The Work Number\u00ae from Equifax\n\nAlliance Group's Oscar Lievano Joins the Georgia First Generation Foundation to Empower First-Generation Students\n\nSalt Lake City celebrates announcement that it will host the 2034 Winter Olympics", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_Number", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Work Number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equifax", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equifax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/custom/image/ebec0578-57d0-11ee-978f-b7da313020af.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom ordered California state officials today to begin dismantling thousands of homeless encampments, the nation's most sweeping response to a recent Supreme Court ruling that gave governments greater authority to remove homeless people from their streets.\n\nHomeless encampments have vexed California, where housing costs are among the nation's highest, more than any other state. An estimated 180,000 people were homeless last year in California, and most of them were unsheltered. Unlike New York City, most jurisdictions in California do not guarantee a right to housing.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat, called on state and local leaders to \"humanely remove encampments from public spaces\" in an urgent manner, prioritizing those that most threaten health and safety.\n\nHis executive order could divide Democratic local leaders in California, some of whom have already begun to clear encampments while others have denounced the decision from conservative justices as opening the door to inhumane measures to solve a complex crisis.\n\nThe order also comes as Democrats are uniting around Vice President Kamala Harris, a former senator and prosecutor from California, to replace President Joe Biden on the ballot this fall. Republicans have frequently pointed to homelessness in California as an example of the state's purported decline under Newsom and other Democrats, and they are expected to do the same with Harris in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision on June 28 upheld an Oregon city's ban on homeless residents sleeping outdoors. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had found in earlier opinions that it was unconstitutional to punish people for sleeping in public spaces when they had no other legal place to spend the night.\n\nEncampments spread as the 9th Circuit, which covers nine Western states, limited the ability of cities to tackle homelessness with arrests and citations. Many politicians from both parties blamed the appellate court's rulings, and Newsom was among a host of leaders who begged the Supreme Court to intervene.\n\nThe justices granted their request, taking the case that originated in Grants Pass, Oregon, and subsequently ruled 6-3 along ideological lines that the city had not violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment by ticketing homeless campers. Advocates for the rights of homeless people denounced the decision as cruel and predicted that it would incite a \"race to the bottom\" as cities cracked down.\n\nIn his executive order, Newsom advised California cities and counties on how best to ramp up enforcement on a signature issue of his administration. He cannot force them to take action, but can exert political pressure through billions of dollars the state controls for municipalities to address homelessness.\n\nThe order also expanded to other state agencies an approach that the California Department of Transportation has used to clear encampments alongside freeways in the state. Newsom mandated that state officials not simply move campers along, but also work with local governments to house people and provide services into which the state has pumped billions of dollars.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses,\" he said. \"It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nSome state agencies are poised to immediately ramp up enforcement, said Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for the governor's office, while others must develop policies and plans for enforcement, which could take a couple of weeks.\n\nNewsom, who is widely viewed as having presidential aspirations, has channeled about $24 billion into homelessness since he took office in 2019. His administration says it helped move more than 165,000 homeless people into temporary or permanent housing two fiscal years ago, the most recent period for which data is available.\n\nSome local Democratic leaders, including Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, have criticized the ruling. Bass has had early success in reducing the homeless population by moving people off the streets and into motels and shelters, where they receive supportive services.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, Bass said the decision \"must not be used as an excuse for cities across the country to attempt to arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail.\"\n\nBut others have welcomed the ruling.\n\nIn San Francisco, Mayor London Breed, a Democrat, said last week that city officials planned to become \"very aggressive and assertive in moving encampments\" starting next month and might start citing homeless people who refused offers of shelter. The Republican mayor of Lancaster, California, said after the ruling that his community was eager to get moving. \"I'm warming up the bulldozer,\" Mayor R. Rex Parris said.\n\nMost local governments, however, have been torn since the decision over whether to aggressively enforce laws against homelessness. The Supreme Court ruling left many civil protections intact, including prohibitions on excessive fines and violations of due process, and civil liberties groups have warned local governments that they would sue over mistreatment of vulnerable people living on the street.\n\nResearch also indicates that clearing encampments may be of limited value. One recent study of three Los Angeles encampments, by the Rand Corp., found that dismantling them cleaned up the area for a few months but seemed to have little or no long-term effect on a city's homeless population. Another survey, conducted last year by the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California, San Francisco, found that 75% of homeless adults in California were local residents who had become homeless in the county where they had last been housed.\n\nAdministration officials, who spoke on background before the executive order was issued, said it had been drawn up as a regulatory template for government entities that still must deal with encampments, which continue to sprawl across sidewalks, peek from rural wild lands and crop up nightly along beaches and waterways.\n\nSo many people have sought shelter near freeways, for example, that the California Department of Transportation has developed its own protocol and dedicated employees for clearing encampments. From one-person pup tents pitched near offramps to large encampments sheltering dozens of people beneath overpasses, Caltrans, as the department is known, has cleared more than 11,000 campsites since 2021, removing more than 248,000 cubic yards of debris, Newsom administration officials said.\n\nThe governor's directive ordered other state agencies -- including California State Parks and the Department of Fish and Wildlife, both of which oversee immense tracts of land -- to adopt versions of the approach being used at Caltrans. Under that approach, the departments will first target encampments that pose a health and safety risk. The state will provide 48-72 hours of advance notice, and state officials will work with local service providers to connect homeless campers with services and housing. Personal property collected at each site will be bagged, tagged and stored for at least 60 days.\n\nEric Tars, senior policy director at the National Homelessness Law Center in Washington, D.C., called the executive order \"a misdirection of a systemic problem onto the victims.\"\n\n\"The only way to end homeless encampments in California is to end the need for homeless encampments,\" he said. \"California has an affordable housing crisis, and unless Newsom's executive order is coming with sufficient resources to address that, this new push isn't going to work.\"\n\nHe noted that the order does not explicitly mandate that alternative shelter be provided for homeless campers, although it does require agencies and urge local leaders to connect people with service providers.\n\n\"Any policy that doesn't provide for where people can actually be will prolong how long people are on the streets and increase encampments, exactly contrary to their goal,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered state agencies Thursday to start removing homeless encampments on state land in his boldest action yet following a Supreme Court ruling allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces.\n\nThis executive order directs state agencies \"to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.\" It also provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same, which applies pressure on them, though they are not legally bound to the order.\n\nCalifornia is home to roughly one-third of the nation's population of homeless people, a problem that has dogged Newsom since he took office. There are thousands of tents and makeshift shelters across the state that line freeways, and fill parking lots and public parks.\n\nUnder Newsom's direction, state agencies -- including state parks and the department of transportation -- would be required to prioritize clearing encampments that pose safety risks, such as those along waterways. Officials should give \"reasonable\" advance notice to homeless people, offer to connect them to local services and help store their belongings for at least 60 days. Local cities and counties are urged to adopt similar protocols.\n\nLast month the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that said governments could not force people to leave encampments if there weren't any shelter beds available. The case was the most significant on the problem to come before the high court in decades. Cities across the country have been wrestling with the politically complicated task of how to deal with a rising number of people without a permanent place to live and public frustration over related health and safety issues.\n\nNewsom's administration wrote in support of cities' arguments that previous rulings, including one that barred San Francisco from clearing encampments, have prevented the state from solving a critical problem.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part,\" Newsom said in a statement Thursday.\n\nNewsom's decision garnered praise from some local elected officials and business groups, who said they were left with no options to address homeless encampments before the Supreme Court's ruling. San Francisco Mayor London Breed recently said the city will start an \"aggressive\" campaign to clear encampments across the city in August. Her office noted that the governor's order does not affect the city's operations.\n\n\"I applaud Governor Newsom's emphasis on urgency,\" Kathryn Barger, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors said in a statement. \"He rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals. Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by County government.\"\n\nEven Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly blasted Newsom over his handling of the crisis, are rallying behind the order Thursday.\n\n\"Homelessness is one of the biggest challenges we face today and it is imperative we take swift, decisive and effective action to address it,\" Republican Senator Roger Niello said in a statement. \"This executive order is a good step but it will require significant follow-through to ensure its effectiveness.\"\n\nHomeless people and advocates say the sweeps are cruel and a waste of taxpayer money. They say the answer is more housing, not crackdowns.\n\n\"You get your highway off-ramp clean for a moment only,\" Democratic Assemblymember Alex Lee said on social media. \"Without meaningful services and housing, all sweeps do is making a prominent inequality less visible.\"\n\nWhile Newsom cannot order local authorities to act, his administration can apply pressure by withholding money for counties and cities. In 2022, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in homelessness spending from local governments over the lack of progress.\n\nNewsom touted that his administration has spent roughly $24 billion cleaning up streets and housing people but acknowledged the persistent issue. Newsom's administration has also come under fire recently after a state audit found that the state didn't consistently track whether the huge amount of public money spent on this actually improved the situation.\n\nEarlier this year, Newsom threw all of his political weight behind a ballot measure to allow the state to borrow nearly $6.4 billion to build 4,350 housing units, which passed with a razor-thin margin.\n\nThe order comes as Republicans have stepped up their criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris -- a former California district attorney, attorney general and senator who just launched her presidential campaign. Harris entered the race over the weekend after President Joe Biden's announced that he would not seek reelection.\n\nNewsom himself has presidential ambitions, though he's said he wouldn't run against Harris or Biden. He has long been a top Biden campaign surrogate.\n\nThe timing of the executive order is \"curious\" given recent developments in the 2024 presidential race, California political analyst Brian Sobel said. He doubts though that Newsom's move would have much impact on Harris' campaign.\n\n\"Harris' problem isn't in California, because California is a done deal,\" he said. \"Where she needs to do well on issues like this are in swing states.\"\n\nRather, the order is a logical step for Newsom, who called himself the state's \"homeless czar,\" said Wesley Hussey, a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento.\n\n\"I don't think it's being motivated by the presidential race as much as it's definitely something that Newsom cared a lot about,\" Hussey said. \"If you're going to put it in a political context of the election, this isn't going to magically fix the problem.\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

(AP) -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered state agencies Thursday to start removing homeless encampments on state land in his boldest action yet following a Supreme Court ruling allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces.\n\nThis executive order directs state agencies \"to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.\" It also provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same, which applies pressure on them, though they are not legally bound to the order.\n\nCalifornia is home to roughly one-third of the nation's population of homeless people, a problem that has dogged Newsom since he took office. There are thousands of tents and makeshift shelters across the state that line freeways, and fill parking lots and public parks.\n\nUnder Newsom's direction, state agencies -- including state parks and the department of transportation -- would be required to prioritize clearing encampments that pose safety risks, such as those along waterways. Officials should give \"reasonable\" advance notice to homeless people, offer to connect them to local services and help store their belongings for at least 60 days. Local cities and counties are urged to adopt similar protocols.\n\nLast month the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that said governments could not force people to leave encampments if there weren't any shelter beds available. The case was the most significant on the problem to come before the high court in decades. Cities across the country have been wrestling with the politically complicated task of how to deal with a rising number of people without a permanent place to live and public frustration over related health and safety issues.\n\nNewsom's administration wrote in support of cities' arguments that previous rulings, including one that barred San Francisco from clearing encampments, have prevented the state from solving a critical problem.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part,\" Newsom said in a statement Thursday.\n\nNewsom's decision garnered praise from some local elected officials and business groups, who said they were left with no options to address homeless encampments before the Supreme Court's ruling. San Francisco Mayor London Breed recently said the city will start an \"aggressive\" campaign to clear encampments across the city in August. Her office noted that the governor's order does not affect the city's operations.\n\n\"I applaud Governor Newsom's emphasis on urgency,\" Kathryn Barger, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors said in a statement. \"He rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals. Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by County government.\"\n\nEven Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly blasted Newsom over his handling of the crisis, are rallying behind the order Thursday.\n\n\"It's about damn time! Letting people live and die on the streets or in our parks is unsafe and unsanitary,\" Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones said in a statement. He added, \"I am cautiously optimistic that the governor has finally taken note of the urgency of this problem, albeit many years later than needed.\"\n\nHomeless people and advocates say the sweeps are cruel and a waste of taxpayer money. They say the answer is more housing, not crackdowns.\n\n\"You get your highway off-ramp clean for a moment only,\" Democratic Assemblymember Alex Lee said on social media. \"Without meaningful services and housing, all sweeps do is making a prominent inequality less visible.\"\n\nWhile Newsom cannot order local authorities to act, his administration can apply pressure by withholding money for counties and cities. In 2022, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in homelessness spending from local governments over the lack of progress.\n\nNewsom touted that his administration has spent roughly $24 billion cleaning up streets and housing people but acknowledged the persistent issue. Newsom's administration has also come under fire recently after a state audit found that the state didn't consistently track whether the huge amount of public money spent on this actually improved the situation.\n\nEarlier this year, Newsom threw all of his political weight behind a ballot measure to allow the state to borrow nearly $6.4 billion to build 4,350 housing units, which passed with a razor-thin margin.\n\nThe order comes as Republicans have stepped up their criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris -- a former California district attorney, attorney general and senator who just launched her presidential campaign. Harris entered the race over the weekend after President Joe Biden's announced that he would not seek reelection.\n\nNewsom himself has presidential ambitions, though he's said he wouldn't run against Harris or Biden. He has long been a top Biden campaign surrogate.\n\nThe timing of the executive order is \"curious\" given recent developments in the 2024 presidential race, California political analyst Brian Sobel said. He doubts though that Newsom's move would have much impact on Harris' campaign.\n\n\"Harris' problem isn't in California, because California is a done deal,\" he said. \"Where she needs to do well on issues like this are in swing states.\"\n\nRather, the order is a logical step for Newsom, who called himself the state's \"homeless czar,\" said Wesley Hussey, a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento.\n\n\"I don't think it's being motivated by the presidential race as much as it's definitely something that Newsom cared a lot about,\" Hussey said. \"If you're going to put it in a political context of the election, this isn't going to magically fix the problem.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors":

(AP) -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered state agencies Thursday to start removing homeless encampments on state land in his boldest action yet following a Supreme Court ruling allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces.\n\nThis executive order directs state agencies \"to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.\" It also provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same, which applies pressure on them, though they are not legally bound to the order.\n\nCalifornia is home to roughly one-third of the nation's population of homeless people, a problem that has dogged Newsom since he took office. There are thousands of tents and makeshift shelters across the state that line freeways, and fill parking lots and public parks.\n\nUnder Newsom's direction, state agencies -- including state parks and the department of transportation -- would be required to prioritize clearing encampments that pose safety risks, such as those along waterways. Officials should give \"reasonable\" advance notice to homeless people, offer to connect them to local services and help store their belongings for at least 60 days. Local cities and counties are urged to adopt similar protocols.\n\nLast month the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that said governments could not force people to leave encampments if there weren't any shelter beds available. The case was the most significant on the problem to come before the high court in decades. Cities across the country have been wrestling with the politically complicated task of how to deal with a rising number of people without a permanent place to live and public frustration over related health and safety issues.\n\nNewsom's administration wrote in support of cities' arguments that previous rulings, including one that barred San Francisco from clearing encampments, have prevented the state from solving a critical problem.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part,\" Newsom said in a statement Thursday.\n\nNewsom's decision garnered praise from some local elected officials and business groups, who said they were left with no options to address homeless encampments before the Supreme Court's ruling. San Francisco Mayor London Breed recently said the city will start an \"aggressive\" campaign to clear encampments across the city in August. Her office noted that the governor's order does not affect the city's operations.\n\n\"I applaud Governor Newsom's emphasis on urgency,\" Kathryn Barger, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors said in a statement. \"He rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals. Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by County government.\"\n\nEven Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly blasted Newsom over his handling of the crisis, are rallying behind the order Thursday.\n\n\"Homelessness is one of the biggest challenges we face today and it is imperative we take swift, decisive and effective action to address it,\" Republican Senator Roger Niello said in a statement. \"This executive order is a good step but it will require significant follow-through to ensure its effectiveness.\"\n\nHomeless people and advocates say the sweeps are cruel and a waste of taxpayer money. They say the answer is more housing, not crackdowns.\n\n\"You get your highway off-ramp clean for a moment only,\" Democratic Assemblymember Alex Lee said on social media. \"Without meaningful services and housing, all sweeps do is making a prominent inequality less visible.\"\n\nWhile Newsom cannot order local authorities to act, his administration can apply pressure by withholding money for counties and cities. In 2022, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in homelessness spending from local governments over the lack of progress.\n\nNewsom touted that his administration has spent roughly $24 billion cleaning up streets and housing people but acknowledged the persistent issue. Newsom's administration has also come under fire recently after a state audit found that the state didn't consistently track whether the huge amount of public money spent on this actually improved the situation.\n\nEarlier this year, Newsom threw all of his political weight behind a ballot measure to allow the state to borrow nearly $6.4 billion to build 4,350 housing units, which passed with a razor-thin margin.\n\nThe order comes as Republicans have stepped up their criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris -- a former California district attorney, attorney general and senator who just launched her presidential campaign. Harris entered the race over the weekend after President Joe Biden's announced that he would not seek reelection.\n\nNewsom himself has presidential ambitions, though he's said he wouldn't run against Harris or Biden. He has long been a top Biden campaign surrogate.\n\nThe timing of the executive order is \"curious\" given recent developments in the 2024 presidential race, California political analyst Brian Sobel said. He doubts though that Newsom's move would have much impact on Harris' campaign.\n\n\"Harris' problem isn't in California, because California is a done deal,\" he said. \"Where she needs to do well on issues like this are in swing states.\"\n\nRather, the order is a logical step for Newsom, who called himself the state's \"homeless czar,\" said Wesley Hussey, a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento.\n\n\"I don't think it's being motivated by the presidential race as much as it's definitely something that Newsom cared a lot about,\" Hussey said. \"If you're going to put it in a political context of the election, this isn't going to magically fix the problem.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nMMI Taps Dan Jones as Chief Data Officer as It Expands Data

Gavin Newsom ordered California state officials on Thursday to begin dismantling thousands of homeless encampments, the nation's most sweeping response to a recent Supreme Court ruling that gave governments greater authority to remove homeless people from their streets.\n\nHomeless encampments have vexed California, where housing costs are among the nation's highest, more than any other state. An estimated 180,000 people were homeless last year in California, and most of them were unsheltered. Unlike New York City, most jurisdictions in California do not guarantee a right to housing.\n\nMr. Newsom, a Democrat, called on state and local leaders to act on the Supreme Court ruling, which was issued in June, \"with urgency and dignity.\" His executive order could divide Democratic local leaders in California, some of whom have already planned to clear encampments while others have denounced the decision from conservative justices as opening the door to inhumane measures to solve a complex crisis.\n\nThe order also comes as Democrats are uniting around Vice President Kamala Harris, a former senator and prosecutor from California, to replace President Biden on the ballot this fall. Republicans have frequently pointed to homelessness in California as an example of the state's purported decline under Mr. Newsom and other Democrats, and they are expected to do the same with Ms. Harris in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision on June 28 upheld an Oregon city's ban on homeless residents sleeping outdoors. The Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit had found in earlier opinions that it was unconstitutional to punish people for sleeping in public spaces when they had no other legal place to spend the night.\n\nEncampments spread as the Ninth Circuit, which covers nine Western states, limited the ability of cities to tackle homelessness with arrests and citations. Many politicians from both parties blamed the appellate court's rulings, and Mr. Newsom was among a host of leaders who begged the court to intervene.\n\nThe justices granted their request, taking the case that originated in Grants Pass, Ore., and subsequently ruled 6 to 3 along ideological lines that the city had not violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment by ticketing homeless campers. Advocates for the rights of homeless people denounced the decision as cruel and predicted that it would incite a \"race to the bottom\" as cities cracked down.\n\nIn his executive order, Mr. Newsom advised California cities and counties on how best to ramp up enforcement on a signature issue of his administration. He cannot force them to take action, but can exert political pressure through billions of dollars the state controls for municipalities to address homelessness.\n\nThe order also expanded to other state agencies an approach that the California Department of Transportation has used to clear encampments alongside freeways in the state. Mr. Newsom mandated that state officials not simply move campers along, but also work with local governments to house people and provide services into which the state has pumped billions of dollars.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Mr. Newsom said in a statement.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses,\" he added. \"It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nMr. Newsom, who is widely viewed as having presidential aspirations, has channeled about $24 billion into homelessness since he took office in 2019. His administration says it helped move more than 165,000 homeless people into temporary or permanent housing two fiscal years ago, the most recent period for which data is available.\n\nSome local Democratic leaders, including Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, have echoed that opinion. Ms. Bass has had early success in reducing the homeless population by moving people off the streets and into motels and shelters, where they receive supportive services.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, Ms. Bass said the decision \"must not be used as an excuse for cities across the country to attempt to arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail.\"\n\nBut others have welcomed the ruling.\n\nIn San Francisco, Mayor London Breed, a Democrat, said last week that city officials planned to become \"very aggressive and assertive in moving encampments\" starting next month and might start citing homeless people who refused offers of shelter. The Republican mayor of Lancaster, Calif., said after the ruling that his community was eager to get moving. \"I'm warming up the bulldozer,\" Mayor R. Rex Parris said.\n\nMost local governments, however, have been torn since the decision over whether to aggressively enforce laws against homelessness. The Supreme Court ruling left many civil protections intact, including prohibitions on excessive fines and violations of due process, and civil liberties groups have warned local governments that they would sue over mistreatment of vulnerable people living on the street.\n\nResearch also indicates that clearing encampments may be of limited value. One recent study of three Los Angeles encampments, by the RAND Corporation, found that dismantling them cleaned up the area for a few months but seemed to have little or no long-term effect on a city's homeless population. Another survey, conducted last year by the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California, San Francisco, found that 75 percent of homeless adults in California were local residents who had become homeless in the county where they had last been housed.\n\nAdministration officials, who spoke on background before the executive order was issued, said it had been drawn up as a regulatory template for government entities that still must deal with encampments, which continue to sprawl across sidewalks, peek from rural wild lands and crop up nightly along beaches and waterways.\n\nSo many people have sought shelter near freeways, for example, that the California Department of Transportation has developed its own protocol and dedicated employees for clearing encampments. From one-person pup tents pitched near offramps to large encampments sheltering dozens of people beneath overpasses, Caltrans, as the department is known, has cleared more than 11,000 campsites since 2021, removing more than 248,000 cubic yards of debris, Newsom administration officials said.\n\nThe governor's directive ordered other state agencies -- including California State Parks and the Department of Fish and Wildlife, both of which oversee immense tracts of land -- to adopt versions of the approach being used at Caltrans. Under that approach, the departments will first target encampments that pose a health and safety risk. The state will provide 48 to 72 hours of advance notice, and state officials will work with local service providers to connect homeless campers with services and housing. Personal property collected at each site will be bagged, tagged and stored for at least 60 days.\n\nAdministration officials said that Caltrans could immediately accelerate enforcement and that other

Newsom's administration has poured about $24 billion into the homeless issue since 2019.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court's decision, Newsom said the ruling \"provides state and local officials the definitive authority to implement and enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments from our streets.\"\n\n\"This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities,\" the governor said at the time, adding that California remains \"committed to respecting the dignity and fundamental human needs of all people.\"\n\nHomelessness has plagued California for years. The state has the highest homeless population in the country by far. About 180,000 people were homeless last year across the state, and about 123,000 are unsheltered on a given night, according to the latest homeless count.\n\nLast week, San Francisco Democratic Mayor London Breed announced the city plans to be \"very aggressive and assertive in moving encampments.\"\n\nThe city has struggled for years with rampant homelessness, crime, and open-air drug use driven by fentanyl, all of which have driven people and businesses out of downtown. About 38,000 people are homeless in the Bay Area on a given night. That's up 35% since 2019.\n\nHomeless encampments near freeways, under overpasses, and near exit ramps have also become so common that California's transportation department now has its own protocol and workers for clearing encampments.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Breed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Breed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/07/GettyImages-1338935607.jpg?w=1200&h=800&ixlib=react-9.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom ordered state agencies Thursday to start removing homeless encampments on state land in his boldest action yet following a Supreme Court ruling allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces.\n\nBanks said the governor is turning his back on the homeless.\n\n\"The governor is basically putting his foot on someone's necks that don't have a choice. Their only crime is being alive. They haven't done anything wrong. They are just trying to make it,\" he said.\n\nBanks, 38, has been homeless off and on since he was a teenager.\n\nHe said the governor's order will just force homeless people like him to keep moving around.\n\n\"First you could sleep in parks, so we slept in parks. Then the rangers came through and said 'You can't be in parks. You can't sleep here.' So, we went there. They tell us to keep going, and we keep going,\" Banks said.\n\nThe executive order directs state agencies \"to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.\" It also provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same, which applies pressure on them, though they are not legally bound to the order.\n\nCalifornia is home to roughly one-third of the nation's population of homeless people, a problem that has dogged Newsom since he took office.\n\nThere are thousands of tents and makeshift shelters across the state that line freeways and fill parking lots and public parks.\n\nUnder Newsom's direction, state agencies -- including state parks and the Department of Transportation -- would be required to prioritize clearing encampments that pose safety risks, such as those along waterways.\n\nOfficials should give \"reasonable\" advance notice to homeless people, offer to connect them to local services and help store their belongings for at least 60 days. Local cities and counties are urged to adopt similar protocols.\n\nLast month the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that said governments could not force people to leave encampments if there weren't any shelter beds available. The case was the most significant on the problem to come before the high court in decades.\n\nCities across the country have been wrestling with the politically complicated task of how to deal with a rising number of people without a permanent place to live and public frustration over related health and safety issues.\n\nNewsom's administration wrote in support of cities' arguments that previous rulings, including one that barred San Francisco from clearing encampments, have prevented the state from solving a critical problem.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part,\" Newsom said in a statement Thursday.\n\nNewsom's decision garnered praise from some local elected officials, including San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, and business groups, who said they were left with no options to address homeless encampments before the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\n\"San Diegans are very familiar with the fact that there are large encampments on our Caltrans right of ways up and down our county. This direction to his departments will be helpful in making sure we align,\" Gloria said. \"San Diegans don't like encampments and that is why we have passed unsafe camping ordinance that has successfully reduced the number of encampments in downtown San Diego.\"\n\nMeanwhile, San Francisco Mayor London Breed recently said the city will start an \"aggressive\" campaign to clear encampments across the city in August. Her office noted that the governor's order does not affect the city's operations.\n\n\"I applaud Governor Newsom's emphasis on urgency,\" Kathryn Barger, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors said in a statement. \"He rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals. Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by county government.\"\n\nEven Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly blasted Newsom over his handling of the crisis, are rallying behind the order.\n\n\"It's about damn time! Letting people live and die on the streets or in our parks is unsafe and unsanitary,\" Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones said in a statement. \"I am cautiously optimistic that the governor has finally taken note of the urgency of this problem, albeit many years later than needed.\"\n\nHomeless people and advocates say the sweeps are cruel and a waste of taxpayer money. They say the answer is more housing, not crackdowns.\n\n\"You get your highway off-ramp clean for a moment only,\" Democratic Assemblymember Alex Lee said on social media. \"Without meaningful services and housing, all sweeps do is making a prominent inequality less visible.\"\n\nWhile Newsom cannot order local authorities to act, his administration can apply pressure by withholding money for counties and cities. In 2022, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in homelessness spending from local governments over the lack of progress.\n\nNewsom touted that his administration has spent roughly $24 billion cleaning up streets and housing people but acknowledged the persistent issue. Newsom's administration has also come under fire recently after a state audit found that the state didn't consistently track whether the huge amount of public money spent on this actually improved the situation.\n\nIn San Diego, Banks, who has been living under the freeway, said he and his girlfriend finally got a spot in San Diego's Tent City and will soon be leaving the state land.\n\nHe said others are not as fortunate.\n\n\"Not everyone is a bum. Some people just don't have a place to stay,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "10news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGTV"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Newsom orders state officials to ramp up homeless camp sweeps across California", "body": "A month after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling granted officials new authority to police homelessness, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered state agencies to ramp up encampment sweeps and urged local governments to do the same.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nWhile Newsom's executive order only applies to encampments on state property and doesn't require cities or counties take action, it aims to provide local officials a blueprint for responding to street homelessness while \"respecting the dignity and well-being of all Californians.\"\n\n\"We're eager to work with the state to responsibly and quickly remove encampments from state property in San Jose, especially those adjacent to neighborhoods and in dangerous areas along our freeways and on- and off-ramps,\" said San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan in a statement.\n\nMahan has pushed the city to take a tougher stance on encampments while also building new temporary homeless shelters, including tiny homes.\n\n\"Here in San Jose we're working around the clock to stand up safe, managed placements and require they be used -- we appreciate Governor Newsom's order signaling that the state is also ready to solve this crisis with both compassion and urgency,\" Mahan said.\n\nAcross California, some 181,000 people experience homelessness on a given night, almost 30% of the nation's unhoused population. The nine-county Bay Area has an estimated 37,000 homeless residents.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision last month, the Supreme Court's conservative majority agreed to give state and local officials broad power to clear homeless encampments even when those living on the street have nowhere else to go.\n\nSince 2018, lower court rulings had prevented officials in California and throughout the West from arresting or fining people for sleeping on public property if beds weren't available in homeless shelters.\n\nWhen officials moved to shut down an encampment, they were generally expected to offer everyone living there \"adequate shelter.\" But few cities have the resources to move all their homeless residents indoors.\n\nOfficials across party lines from San Francisco to San Diego argued the shelter requirement had hamstrung efforts to close dangerous tent and vehicle camps. Under growing public pressure to move homeless people from parks, creeks and city sidewalks, they urged the high court to allow more flexibility in clearing and managing encampments -- and many, including Newsom, celebrated last month's ruling.\n\nAdvocates for homeless people, however, argue the decision could clear the way for officials to \"criminalize homelessness\" without addressing the root causes of the crisis.\n\nFollowing the ruling, most Bay Area cities haven't indicated whether they will start disbanding more encampments. One notable exception is San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who said city officials plan to launch a \"very aggressive\" crackdown on camps next month. Breed and Mahan have also said their cities could soon start fining homeless people who turn down shelter beds.\n\nOn Thursday, Newsom said the high court's decision cleared the way for the order, which directs state agencies, including the California Department of Transportation, to work with local governments to identify and shut down encampments. The order instructs officials to reach out to service providers to help campers but does not require agencies to offer shelter or housing before carrying out a sweep.\n\nNewsom also touted the $1 billion the state has sent to local governments in recent years to close encampments and help move people to shelter or housing. Over the past five years, California has spent about $24 billion on various homeless programs, but a scathing state audit found officials have failed to track whether the money is actually helping solve the crisis.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mahan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Mahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_shelter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homeless shelter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Breed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Breed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/299/29936/2993613.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom (D) ordered the removal of homeless encampments in the state following the recent Supreme Court ruling that empowers cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public.\n\nNewsom's executive order directs state agencies and departments to develop \"clear policies\" to \"urgently address\" the thousands of homeless encampments located across California, his office said Thursday.\n\nThe order requires agencies to prioritize clearing encampments with safety risks and to provide advance notice of the clearance. Officials were also told to work with local service providers who can support the people at the encampments and help store their belongings for at least 60 days.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything more urgent and more frustrating than addressing the issue of encampments in the state of California,\" Newsom said Thursday in a video.\n\nThe governor noted that the courts previously prevented the local government and state from cleaning up the encampments, but the Supreme Court decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson changes things.\n\nIn the decision, the high court ruled cities can ticket homeless people for camping in public even when there is no alternative shelter available.\n\nThe justices sided 6-3 with the Oregon city of Grants Pass, which asked the high court to review a lower court's decision blocking the enforcement of a public camping ordinance.\n\nThe lower court initially determined banning camping where shelter beds were limited amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, but Grants Pass officials argued the restrictions imposed by the decision prevented them from implementing \"common sense\" laws against camping in some public places.\n\n\"Today I announced an executive order to move the process forward. We're done, it's time to move with urgency at the local level to clean up these sites, to focus on public health and focus on public safety. There are no longer any excuses,\" Newsom said. \"We now have no excuse with the Supreme Court decision.\"\n\nCalifornia has so far invested more than $1 billion in encampment resolution grants to clean up homeless encampments and address the underlying issues, per the governor.\n\nCalifornia has about one-third of the nation's population of homeless people, and Newsom has been a vocal advocate for addressing the issue. His office touted his administration has spent about $24 billion total to clean up the streets and house people.\n\nEarlier this year, he supported a ballot measure to allow the state to borrow about $6.4 billion to build 4,350 housing units, which passed with a thin margin, The Associated Press reported.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miranda_nazzaro@thehill.com", "name": "Miranda Nazzaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/AP24193819201750-e1721929594755.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom after the Democrat issued an executive order to shut down homeless encampments on state property and to incentivize local authorities to do the same.\n\nThe order marks the first notable state policy shift to result from a momentous U.S. Supreme Court ruling on June 28, decided 6-3 on ideological lines, that the liberal dissenting justices argued criminalized homelessness.\n\nEric Tars, a policy director at the National Homelessness Law Center, toldThe New York Times that the executive order effectively blamed the victims of a systemic problem.\n\n\"The only way to end homeless encampments in California is to end the need for homeless encampments,\" he said. \"California has an affordable housing crisis, and unless Newsom's executive order is coming with sufficient resources to address that, this new push isn't going to work.\"\n\nIn a direct response to Newsom on social media, Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said that the governor hadn't provided the fundamental ingredient needed to solve the homelessness problem.\n\n\"You didn't provide the needed affordable housing,\" she wrote. \"You're choosing political expediency over real solutions. That's not leadership, it's cowardice. This will only worsen homelessness.\"\n\nEchoing the need for more housing, Nina Turner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, called the Newsom decision \"shameful,\" while Jordan Chariton, a journalist at Status Coup, a progressive media outlet, called it \"disgusting,\" saying Newsom's solution was to \"sweep them all up like it's taking out the trash.\"\n\nMel Buer, a reporter for The Real News Network, indicated on social media that the decision was in keeping with the political approach of the governor, who is widely believed to have presidential ambitions.\n\n\"Saw this one coming from a mile off,\" Buer wrote of Thursday's executive order. \"Newsom's a fucking heartless dipshit who would rather court billionaire donors to his 2028 presidential run than be a real human being.\"\n\nCritics of last month's Supreme Court ruling in City of Grants Pass, Oregon v. Johnson argued that it would lead to a crackdown on homelessness throughout the country. The conservative justices ruled that the Oregon city could ban sleeping in public places -- sidewalks, streets, parks -- overturning a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision that the local law was unconstitutional.\n\nThe San Francisco-based 9th Circuit is one of the most liberal courts in the country and had issued a number of rulings in favor of the rights of homeless people in recent years, frustrating Republicans and some Democrats including Newsom.\n\nCalifornia is home to roughly one-third of the nation's homeless population and the reasons for the problem are the subject of fierce ideological debate, as are the solutions. This was evident in the response to the Supreme Court ruling, which led one Republican mayor in California to declare that he was \"warming up the bulldozer.\"\n\nNewsom welcomed the ruling but other Democrats, such as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, expressed dismay and concern.\n\n\"This ruling must not be used as an excuse for cities across the country to attempt to arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail,\" Bass said a statement at the time.\n\nNewsom doesn't have the power to force local authorities such as Bass to remove homeless encampments but could wield influence at the municipal level because of his control over billions in funding to address homelessness, The New York Timesreported.\n\nNewsom's administration has spent $24 billion in responding to the homelessness crisis since he took office in 2019, including $1 billion to help municipalities remove encampments and $3.3 billion to expand housing for homeless people, the executive order says.\n\nHomeless people still have civil rights, advocacy groups say, warning that they will sue local governments that mistreat the unsheltered. They also point to research showing that sweeping encampments is ineffective, as it doesn't address the root problems of homelessness. A Rand Corporation survey last year showed that sweeps affect homeless populations in an area only temporarily.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"},

Gavin Newsom issued an executive order on July 25 directing state departments and agencies to start clearing encampments.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Mr. Newsom said in a statement accompanying the order.\n\nWhile he cannot force local governments to act in their jurisdictions, he urged officials to adopt policies that allow for the removal of homeless camps to help protect public safety.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nThe executive order noted the impact of legal action and injunctions that have prevented local officials from removing encampments in the past, thus \"leaving officials without the tools or guidance necessary to address the crisis on their streets.\"\n\nThe Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in a case known as Grants Pass issued in September 2022 blocked local governments from clearing encampments and enforcing their laws, with justices declaring such would be \"cruel and unusual punishment\" if sufficient shelter space were not available.\n\nBut the high court's 6-3 ruling on June 28 overturned the decision.\n\n\"Though doubtless well intended ... answers to questions such as what constitutes 'involuntarily' homelessness or when a shelter is 'practically available' cannot be found in the cruel and unusual punishments clause\" of the U.S. Constitution, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the majority opinion. \"Nor do federal judges enjoy any special competence to provide them.\"\n\nWith the legal obstacles now removed, the governor is ordering agencies and departments under his authority to immediately begin clearing encampments from state property.\n\nOfficials are instructed to follow guidelines in the California Department of Transportation's Maintenance Policy Directive, working in partnership with local agencies while prioritizing removing encampments.\n\nSite assessments will determine if encampments pose imminent threats -- including those to \"life, health, safety, or infrastructure\" -- and if any are found, the encampments are to be immediately cleared.\n\nFor encampments where no such threats are identified, officials are ordered to post a notice to vacate sites at least 48 hours before sweeps begin.\n\nOutreach services for those living at the camps will be provided.\n\nFor personal items cleared from the encampments, officials will collect, label, and store property for at least 60 days.\n\nDepartments and agencies not under the governor's direct authority are requested to follow similar guidelines.\n\nSimilarly, local governments are \"encouraged\" to adopt the policies and to take advantage of available resources and infrastructure \"to take action with the urgency this crisis demands to humanely remove encampments from public spaces,\" the executive order states.\n\nSan Francisco recently announced that leaders are crafting new guidelines to remove encampments, but other cities such as Los Angeles have expressed reluctance to do so. It remains to be seen which cities and counties will follow the governor's orders.\n\nThe California Interagency Council on Homelessness will oversee the implementation of policies consistent with the executive order.\n\nMr. Newsom said the new directive is needed because the state is dealing with homelessness that has grown in recent decades -- with more than 180,000 people affected, including 123,000 living unsheltered on the street, with some in tents, vehicles, and trailers.\n\nThat presents a danger to homeless individuals, according to the executive order, subjecting people to \"extreme weather, fires, predatory and criminal activity, and widespread substance use, harming their health, safety, and well-being.\"\n\nThe governor said he has prioritized eradicating homelessness since the first year of his administration. He also issued an executive order in 2020 directing departments to identify how to use resources for short-term shelters.\n\nSince July 2021, the California Department of Transportation has removed 11,188 encampments on state property and 248,275 cubic yards of debris from those encampments, according to the newly released order.\n\nSince Mr. Newsom took office, California has spent more than $24 billion addressing homelessness -- including nearly $5 billion in Homeless Housing, Assistance, and Prevention grants; $1 billion in encampment resolution funding; and $3.3 billion to house individuals in hotels and other locations as part of the state's Homekey program.\n\nCiting a need to improve accountability, the governor and the Legislature passed the 2024-2025 budget with trailer bills that call for increased metrics and reporting that allow officials to better follow the money and identify which programs are providing benefits and which ones are failing to meet expectations.\n\nThe order declares that the new guidelines prioritizing shelter and services are a necessary step to removing encampments while respecting the \"dignity of every Californian and [providing] meaningful paths to ending homelessness.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/id1007032-EpochImages-8200824592-xl-SB.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 197, "textEnd": 204}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 1425, "textEnd": 1432}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom will order California state officials on Thursday to begin dismantling thousands of homeless encampments, according to members of his administration, calling on government leaders to act on a recent Supreme Court decision \"with urgency and dignity.\"\n\nThe executive order, which is expected to affect tens of thousands of people, represents the nation's most sweeping response to a June ruling that gave governments greater authority to remove homeless people from their streets.\n\nHomeless encampments have vexed California, where housing costs are among the nation's highest, more than any other state. An estimated 180,000 people were homeless last year in California, the most in the nation, and about 123,000 homeless people on any given night were unsheltered, according to the most recent count. Unlike New York City, most jurisdictions in California do not guarantee a right to housing.\n\nNewsom will advise California cities and counties on how best to ramp up enforcement on a signature issue of his administration, but he cannot force them to take action. He also will mandate that state agencies not simply move campers along, but also work with local governments to house people and provide services into which the state has pumped billions of dollars.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses,\" he said. \"It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nNewsom, who is widely viewed as having presidential aspirations, has channeled about $24 billion into homelessness since he took office in 2019. His administration says it helped move more than 165,000 homeless people into temporary or permanent housing two fiscal years ago, the most recent period for which data is available.\n\nThe governor's directive this week follows a Supreme Court decision on June 28 that upheld an Oregon city's ban on homeless residents sleeping outdoors. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had found in earlier opinions that it was unconstitutional to punish people for sleeping in public spaces when they had no other legal place to spend the night.\n\nEncampments spread as the 9th Circuit, which covers nine Western states, limited the ability of cities to tackle homelessness with arrests and citations. Many politicians from both parties blamed the rulings, even as cities spent heavily on homeless services and affordable housing to address a suddenly visible problem. Newsom was among a host of leaders who begged the Supreme Court to intervene.\n\nThe justices granted their request, taking the case that originated in Grants Pass, Oregon, and subsequently ruled 6-3 along ideological lines that the city had not violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment by ticketing homeless campers. Advocates for homeless people denounced the decision as cruel and predicted that it would incite a \"race to the bottom\" as cities cracked down.\n\nSome local leaders, including Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, have echoed that opinion. But others have welcomed the decision.\n\nIn San Francisco, Mayor London Breed, a Democrat, said last week that city officials planned to become \"very aggressive and assertive in moving encampments\" starting next month and might start citing homeless people who refused offers of shelter. The Republican mayor of Lancaster, California, said after the ruling that his community was eager to get moving. \"I'm warming up the bulldozer,\" Mayor R. Rex Parris said.\n\nMost local governments, however, have been torn since the decision over whether to aggressively enforce laws against homelessness. The Supreme Court ruling left many civil protections intact, including prohibitions on excessive fines and violations of due process, and civil liberties groups have warned local governments that they would sue over mistreatment of vulnerable people living on the street.\n\nResearch also indicates that clearing encampments may be of limited value. One recent study, by the RAND Corp., found that dismantling them had little or no long-term effect on a city's homeless population. Another survey, conducted last year by the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California, San Francisco, found that 75% of homeless adults in California were local residents who had become homeless in the county where they had last been housed.\n\nAdministration officials, who spoke on background because the executive order had not yet been issued, said it had been drawn up as a regulatory template for government entities that still must deal with encampments, which continue to sprawl across sidewalks, peek from rural wild lands and crop up nightly along beaches and waterways.\n\nSo many people have sought shelter near freeways, for example, that the California Department of Transportation has developed its own protocol and dedicated employees for clearing encampments. From one-person pup tents pitched near offramps to large encampments sheltering dozens of people beneath overpasses, Caltrans, as the department is known, has cleared more than 11,000 campsites since 2021, removing more than 248,000 cubic yards of debris, Newsom administration officials said.\n\nThe governor's directive will order other state agencies -- including California State Parks and the Department of Fish and Wildlife, both of which oversee immense tracts of land -- to adopt versions of the approach being used at Caltrans. Under that approach, the departments will first target encampments that pose a health and safety risk. The state will provide 48-72 hours of advance notice, and state officials will work with local service providers to connect homeless campers with services and housing. Personal property collected at each site will be bagged, tagged and stored for at least 60 days.\n\nAdministration officials said Caltrans could immediately accelerate enforcement and that other state agencies should have the new rules in place within a couple of weeks.\n\nThe state cannot legally force cities to adopt the Caltrans system. But Newsom and state lawmakers can pressure local leaders because they control billions of dollars of funding intended to address homelessness.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType":

Gavin Newsom will order California officials on Thursday to begin dismantling thousands of homeless encampments, according to officials in his administration, calling on government leaders to act on a recent Supreme Court decision \"with urgency and dignity.\"\n\nThe executive order, which is expected to affect tens of thousands of people, represents the nation's most sweeping response to a June ruling that gave governments greater authority to remove homeless people from their streets.\n\nHomeless encampments have vexed California, where housing costs are among the nation's highest, more than any other state. An estimated 180,000 people were homeless last year in California, the most in the nation, and about 123,000 homeless people on any given night were unsheltered, according to the most recent count. Unlike New York City, most jurisdictions in California do not guarantee a right to housing.\n\nGovernor Newsom will instruct California cities and counties on how best to ramp up enforcement on a signature issue of his administration. He also will mandate that state agencies not simply move campers along, but also work with local governments to house people and provide services into which the state has pumped billions of dollars.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Mr. Newsom said in a statement.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses,\" he added. \"It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nMr. Newsom, who is widely viewed as having presidential aspirations, has channeled about $24 billion into homelessness since he took office in 2019. His administration says it helped move more than 165,000 homeless people into temporary or permanent housing two fiscal years ago, the most recent period for which data is available.\n\nThe governor's directive this week follows a Supreme Court decision on June 28 that upheld an Oregon city's ban on homeless residents sleeping outdoors. The Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit had found in earlier opinions that it was unconstitutional to punish people for sleeping in public spaces when they had no other legal place to spend the night.\n\nEncampments spread as the Ninth Circuit, which covers nine Western states, limited the ability of cities to tackle homelessness with arrests and citations. Many politicians from both parties blamed the rulings, even as cities spent heavily on homeless services and affordable housing to address a suddenly visible problem. Mr. Newsom was among a host of leaders who begged the court to intervene.\n\nThe justices granted their request, taking the case that originated in Grants Pass, Ore., and subsequently ruled 6 to 3 along ideological lines that the city had not violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment by ticketing homeless campers. Advocates for homeless people denounced the decision as cruel and predicted that it would incite a \"race to the bottom\" as cities cracked down.\n\nSome local leaders, including Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles, have echoed that opinion. But others have welcomed the decision.\n\nIn San Francisco, Mayor London Breed, a Democrat, said last week that city officials planned to become \"very aggressive and assertive in moving encampments\" starting next month and might start citing homeless people who refused offers of shelter. The Republican mayor of Lancaster, Calif., said after the ruling that his community was eager to get moving. \"I'm warming up the bulldozer,\" Mayor R. Rex Parris said.\n\nMost local governments, however, have been torn since the decision over whether to aggressively enforce laws against homelessness. The Supreme Court ruling left many civil protections intact, including prohibitions on excessive fines and violations of due process, and civil liberties groups have warned local governments that they would sue over mistreatment of vulnerable people living on the street.\n\nResearch also indicates that clearing encampments may be of limited value. One recent study, by the RAND Corporation, found that dismantling them had little or no long-term effect on a city's homeless population. Another survey, conducted last year by the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at the University of California, San Francisco, found that 75 percent of homeless adults in California were local residents who had become homeless in the county where they had last been housed.\n\nAdministration officials, who spoke on background because the executive order had not yet been issued, said it had been drawn up as a regulatory template for government entities that still must deal with encampments, which continue to sprawl across sidewalks, peek from rural wild lands and crop up nightly along beaches and waterways.\n\nSo many people have sought shelter near freeways, for example, that the California Department of Transportation has developed its own protocol and dedicated employees for clearing encampments. From one-person pup tents pitched near offramps to large encampments sheltering dozens of people beneath overpasses, Caltrans, as the department is known, has cleared more than 11,000 campsites since 2021, removing more than 248,000 cubic yards of debris, Newsom administration officials said.\n\nThe governor's directive will order other state agencies -- including California State Parks and the Department of Fish and Wildlife, both of which oversee immense tracts of land -- to adopt versions of the approach being used at Caltrans. Under that approach, the departments will first target encampments that pose a health and safety risk. The state will provide 48 to 72 hours of advance notice, and state officials will work with local service providers to connect homeless campers with services and housing. Personal property collected at each site will be bagged, tagged and stored for at least 60 days.\n\nAdministration officials said that Caltrans could immediately accelerate enforcement and that other state agencies should have the new rules in place within a couple of weeks.\n\nThe state cannot legally force cities to adopt the Caltrans system. But Mr. Newsom and state lawmakers can pressure local leaders because they control billions of dollars of funding intended to address homelessness.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType":

Gavin Newsom issues executive order for removal of homeless encampments in California", "body": "(CNN) -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom, buoyed by a recent US Supreme Court decision, issued an executive order Thursday calling on state officials to begin taking down homeless encampments.\n\nThe move to begin dismantling thousands of encampments throughout California comes after the high court ruled last month in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside. The ruling rejected arguments that such \"anti-camping\" ordinances violated the Constitution's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newson said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nThe order calls on state officials \"to adopt humane and dignified policies to urgently address encampments on state property.\"\n\nCalifornia has the largest homeless population - more than 180,000 people - in the nation, according to a 2023 homelessness assessment report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nAn estimated 653,100 people were experiencing homelessness nationwide - a jump of around 12% since 2022, according to the report.\n\nCalifornia's policies following the Supreme Court decision are being closely watched by other cities and states, and Newsom's order has drawn the ire of some homeless advocates and elected officials.\n\n\"Newsom could have issued this order before the (Supreme Court) decision. The only difference now is that states and localities are free to confine and arrest people even when there is no shelter available,\" said Chris Herring, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California Los Angeles.\n\n\"So before the Supreme Court ruling cities were in the position where they would have to provide shelter offers before removing encampments. Now ... they will be able to carry out these encampment sweeps with the very real threat of issuing people incredibly expensive fines of which people cannot pay and often results in a warrant or an arrest or can result in incarceration.\"\n\nHerring said the timing of the order wasn't surprising as Newsom seeks to \"politically clear his name of the homeless crisis, especially as he's in the national spotlight right now amid the presidential election.\"\n\nMichael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent organization of the Housing is a Human Right initiative, accused Newsom of \"criminalizing poverty\" and \"doubling down on failed policies.\"\n\n\"Governor Newsom, where do you expect people to go? This is a shameful moment in California history,\" Weinstein said in a statement Thursday.\n\nOrder is 'a punch in the gut,' advocate says\n\nIn San Francisco, a spokesperson for Mayor London Breed said the city had already started to take action.\n\n\"Our city encampment teams and street outreach staff have been going out every day to bring people indoors, and to clean and clear encampments,\" spokesperson Parisa Safarzadeh told CNN in a statement. \"This is why we are seeing a five year low in the City's tent count on our streets.\"\n\nBut Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, called Newsom's executive order \"a punch in the gut.\"\n\nShe said there are already thousands of people on a waitlist for housing, and all shelter beds in San Francisco are already full.\n\n\"They want to basically crack down on folks who have no other choice,\" she said.\n\nStudy shows cleanups do little to change number of homeless\n\nLate last month, the results of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority's point-in-time count - conducted in January - showed the homeless population in Los Angeles had dropped for the first time in six years. It showed overall homelessness and in particular unsheltered homelessness was down in both Los Angeles County and the city. According to the count, homelessness was down 2.2% in the Los Angeles and 0.27% in the county.\n\nThere were still 45,253 homeless people counted in the city and 75,312 people unhoused in the county, the authority reported.\n\n\"For the first time in years, unsheltered homelessness has decreased in Los Angeles because of a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Thursday.\n\n\"Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work.\"\n\nIn fact, a new study by the Rand Corp's Center on Housing and Homelessness found encampment clearing efforts in Los Angeles had no long-term effect on the number of people on the streets.\n\nThe researchers looked at encampment cleanups in Venice, Hollywood and Skid Row in Los Angeles and \"observed temporary declines in the unsheltered population that lasted two to three months on average\" before returning to previous levels, according to the study.\n\nIn Venice, for instance, encampment removals meant \"the share of unhoused people living literally unsheltered (e.g., without a tent) increased from 20 percent to 46 percent,\" the study said.\n\nNewsom last month praised the high court's ruling, saying it \"provides state and local officials the definitive authority to implement and enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments from our streets.\"\n\n\"This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities,\" Newsom added.\n\nThe case was the most significant appeal involving unhoused Americans to reach the Supreme Court in decades.\n\nLA County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said Newsom \"rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals.\"\n\n\"Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by County government,\" Barger said in a statement. \"This formula, which is largely based on partnerships, is how we can deliver permanent results. No single entity can achieve that.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Carter", "body": "California Governor Gavin Newsom has directed state officials to remove homeless encampments across the state following a recent Supreme Court ruling. As California continues to grapple with one of the highest homelessness rates in the country, the Court's decision in June affirmed that local governments have the right to ban public camping and impose fines on violators, clearing a legal path for stricter measures on encampments.\n\nIn an executive order announced on Thursday, Newsom advised cities to enforce the removal of encampments from public property while simultaneously providing social services and housing alternatives for the displaced individuals, reports National Review. The order, given by liberal Democrat Newsom, is a huge shift from the progressive state governments actions over the last decade.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nUntil the Supreme Court's decision, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had restricted local governments from banning public camping if cities lacked sufficient shelter beds. This restriction had been a significant barrier for cities attempting to address the growing issue of homelessness. In 2023, California was estimated to have 180,000 people experiencing homelessness, a number that has continued to climb despite various efforts to mitigate the crisis.\n\nNewsom's executive order calls for a balanced approach, emphasizing both enforcement and support. Cities are encouraged to crack down on encampments while also providing necessary social services and housing solutions to those affected.\n\nWhile the order signals a tough stance on encampments, it also claims to ensure that affected individuals are not simply displaced without assistance by providing housing alternatives and social services.\n\nCritics of the move argue that simply removing encampments without addressing the underlying causes of homelessness -- such as lack of affordable housing, mental health issues, and substance abuse -- will not provide a long-term solution. Advocates for the homeless stress the importance of comprehensive support services alongside enforcement measures.\n\nProponents, however, argue that the visible presence of encampments poses public health and safety risks and that the new measures will help restore order to public spaces while still offering support to those in need.", "source": {"uri": "saraacarter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sara A.

Gavin Newsom issues executive order for removal of homeless encampments in California", "body": "By Ray Sanchez, Cheri Mossburg and Stephanie Becker, CNN\n\n(CNN) -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom, buoyed by a recent US Supreme Court decision, issued an executive order Thursday calling on state officials to begin taking down homeless encampments.\n\nThe move to begin dismantling thousands of encampments throughout California comes after the high court ruled last month in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside. The ruling rejected arguments that such \"anti-camping\" ordinances violated the Constitution's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newson said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nThe order calls on state officials \"to adopt humane and dignified policies to urgently address encampments on state property.\"\n\nCalifornia has the largest homeless population - more than 180,000 people - in the nation, according to a 2023 homelessness assessment report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nAn estimated 653,100 people were experiencing homelessness nationwide - a jump of around 12% since 2022, according to the report.\n\nCalifornia's policies following the Supreme Court decision are being closely watched by other cities and states, and Newsom's order has drawn the ire of some homeless advocates and elected officials.\n\n\"Newsom could have issued this order before the (Supreme Court) decision. The only difference now is that states and localities are free to confine and arrest people even when there is no shelter available,\" said Chris Herring, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California Los Angeles.\n\n\"So before the Supreme Court ruling cities were in the position where they would have to provide shelter offers before removing encampments. Now ... they will be able to carry out these encampment sweeps with the very real threat of issuing people incredibly expensive fines of which people cannot pay and often results in a warrant or an arrest or can result in incarceration.\"\n\nHerring said the timing of the order wasn't surprising as Newsom seeks to \"politically clear his name of the homeless crisis, especially as he's in the national spotlight right now amid the presidential election.\"\n\nMichael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent organization of the Housing is a Human Right initiative, accused Newsom of \"criminalizing poverty\" and \"doubling down on failed policies.\"\n\n\"Governor Newsom, where do you expect people to go? This is a shameful moment in California history,\" Weinstein said in a statement Thursday.\n\nIn San Francisco, a spokesperson for Mayor London Breed said the city had already started to take action.\n\n\"Our city encampment teams and street outreach staff have been going out every day to bring people indoors, and to clean and clear encampments,\" spokesperson Parisa Safarzadeh told CNN in a statement. \"This is why we are seeing a five year low in the City's tent count on our streets.\"\n\nBut Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, called Newsom's executive order \"a punch in the gut.\"\n\nShe said there are already thousands of people on a waitlist for housing, and all shelter beds in San Francisco are already full.\n\n\"They want to basically crack down on folks who have no other choice,\" she said.\n\nLate last month, the results of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority's point-in-time count - conducted in January - showed the homeless population in Los Angeles had dropped for the first time in six years. It showed overall homelessness and in particular unsheltered homelessness was down in both Los Angeles County and the city. According to the count, homelessness was down 2.2% in the Los Angeles and 0.27% in the county.\n\nThere were still 45,253 homeless people counted in the city and 75,312 people unhoused in the county, the authority reported.\n\n\"For the first time in years, unsheltered homelessness has decreased in Los Angeles because of a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Thursday.\n\n\"Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work.\"\n\nIn fact, a new study by the Rand Corp's Center on Housing and Homelessness found encampment clearing efforts in Los Angeles had no long-term effect on the number of people on the streets.\n\nThe researchers looked at encampment cleanups in Venice, Hollywood and Skid Row in Los Angeles and \"observed temporary declines in the unsheltered population that lasted two to three months on average\" before returning to previous levels, according to the study.\n\nIn Venice, for instance, encampment removals meant \"the share of unhoused people living literally unsheltered (e.g., without a tent) increased from 20 percent to 46 percent,\" the study said.\n\nNewsom last month praised the high court's ruling, saying it \"provides state and local officials the definitive authority to implement and enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments from our streets.\"\n\n\"This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities,\" Newsom added.\n\nThe case was the most significant appeal involving unhoused Americans to reach the Supreme Court in decades.\n\nLA County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said Newsom \"rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals.\"\n\n\"Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by County government,\" Barger said in a statement. \"This formula, which is largely based on partnerships, is how we can deliver permanent results. No single entity can achieve that.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

She's not the only one.\n\nThe New York Times reports that Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Thursday morning directing state agencies to clear encampments, in what the Times calls \"the nation's most sweeping response\" to the Supreme Court decision.\n\nYou may recall that the state transportation agency Caltrans was involved with clearing Oakland's notorious Wood Street encampment in the summer of 2022. Newsom's executive order Thursday declares that other state agencies like California State Parks and the Department of Fish and Wildlife would also be involved with encampment clearing.\n\nNewsom's announcement was accompanied by a Twitter video where he's donning a pair of Joe Biden-style aviator sunglasses and seen picking up and carrying trash, looking like Mister Very Hands-On.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything more urgent and more frustrating than addressing the issue of encampments in the state of California,\" Newsom says in his video. \"We're done. It's time to move with urgency at the local level to clean up these sites.\"\n\nBut Newsom also engages in his signature advance-blaming of cities if his new order has little impact. \"We have now no excuse with the Supreme Court decision. This executive order is about pushing that paradigm further and getting the sense of urgency that's required of local government to do their job,\" he adds.\n\nAs the Associated Press points out, it's still up to cities to order the encampments' removal, and state agencies would just help with the grunt work. That outlet reports that Newsom's order provides guidelines that \"direct state agencies on how to remove\" the encampments, but those state agencies would still take their marching orders from local governments. The AP notes that \"The order makes clear that the decision to remove the encampments remains in the hands of local authorities.\"\n\nAnd some of those local authorities might push back. After the Supreme Court decision, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the ruling \"must not be used as an excuse for cities across the country to attempt to arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail,\" according to the Times.\n\nCalifornia currently has an estimated 180,000 unsheltered people statewide. And Newsom's order is big on announcing more aggressive encampment clearing, but has very little to say in terms of resources for, you know, providing those people with someplace to go once all their stuff has been hauled away.\n\nAnd there is certainly the political angle here of how California's homelessness problems can be weaponized against Kamala Harris's presidential campaign. While the highest state office Harris ever held was California Attorney General, which is not a job that has much jurisdiction over the homelessness issue, there's sure to be plenty of California \"failed state\" rhetoric from the Trump camp in the months to come.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Newsom's executive order is going to be able to haul away or clear that sentiment.", "source": {"uri": "sfist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SFist - San Francisco News, Restaurants, Events, & Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Breed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Breed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.sfist.com/2024/07/newsom-wood-street.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Newsom orders state agencies to clear homeless encampments", "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom today ordered state agencies to remove homeless camps throughout California, his first major show of force since the Supreme Court granted state and local authorities more power to clear encampments.\n\nNewsom's executive order mandates that state agencies and departments adopt policies to clear camps on state property. It also encourages local governments to do the same.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newsom said in a news release. \"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets. There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nThe move comes almost a month after the U.S. Supreme Court upended six years of protections for residents of homeless encampments in California and other western states. Previously, cities were prohibited from punishing people for sleeping outside if they had nowhere else to go. As a result, local courts ordered several cities, including San Francisco, to halt or pause encampment sweeps.\n\nReversing that precedent in Grants Pass v. Johnson, the justices last month found it is not unconstitutional for a city to ban homeless encampments, even if there is no shelter available. The ruling, which Newsom cheered, gives city leaders broad authority to crack down on camps.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass, who opposed the Grants Pass ruling last month, also was critical of Newsom's new order.\n\n\"Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work,\" she said in an emailed statement. \"We thank the Governor for his partnership thus far and hope that he will continue collaboration on strategies that work.\"\n\nBut business interests applauded the governor for taking action.\n\n\"Getting our many thousands of unhoused residents indoors and out of unsafe, unhealthy and inhumane outdoor encampments is critical to ending California's homelessness crisis,\" Jim Wunderman, President and CEO of the business-backed public policy group the Bay Area Council, said in an emailed statement. \"California cities must now rise to meet this moment, to grab this opportunity and provide the shelter and housing that can end our long homelessness nightmare and restore a sense of order and civility to our streets, sidewalks and other public spaces.\"\n\nPer Newsom's new order, state agencies are to model their encampment policies around one that Caltrans has used for several years to remove camps on highway on and off ramps, under overpasses and on other land maintained by the transit agency. State agencies should warn residents at least 48 hours before clearing a camp. They also are required to store residents' belongings for at least 60 days, and to request services for displaced residents from local organizations. If an encampment poses an \"imminent threat\" to life, health, safety or infrastructure, the agency can remove a camp immediately.\n\nCaltrans has cleared 11,188 encampments since July 2021, according to the governor's office. Newsom has personally attended some of those cleanups, wearing a baseball hat and gloves to help pick up trash left behind.\n\nBut Caltrans has faced backlash for the way it handles encampment cleanups. In 2020, the agency agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle a lawsuit that accused it of destroying property belonging to homeless Alameda County residents.\n\nNewsom took a softer tone with local governments, urging them to voluntarily adopt policies similar to the one used by Caltrans. He also promised the state, via the California Interagency Council on Homelessness, will provide guidance and technical assistance to help local leaders set up programs.\n\nClearing, also known as \"sweeping,\" encampments is a controversial strategy for dealing with homelessness. Without moving people into housing, all sweeps do is make homelessness less visible without actually solving the problem, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, said on X in response to Newsom's order.\n\n\"You get your highway off ramp clean for a moment only,\" he said.\n\nIt's unclear how the order will be enforced, and whether there will be any penalties for cities and counties that don't ramp up efforts to clear homeless camps. Newsom could withhold funding from local governments that he feels are not meeting his expectations, as he's done in the past. In 2022, he briefly rescinded $1 billion from cities and counties after accusing them of failing to take big enough steps to reduce homelessness.\n\nThis month, Newsom's office clawed back $10 million that had been allocated to San Diego County to set up 150 tiny homes for homeless residents. The county took too long to come up with a plan for the tiny homes, according to the governor's office. Those 150 tiny homes were supposed to be part of a larger effort to deploy 1,200 state-funded tiny homes throughout California. In May, CalMatters reported that delays and about-faces had stymied the program, and only 150 of the small dwellings had been purchased.\n\nCalMatters has requested additional details from the governor's office regarding the scope of his executive order and how it will be enforced, and will update this story with more information.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Gavin Newsom will order state officials to dismantle thousands of homeless encampments across the state, as first reported by the New York Times on Thursday.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of a recent Supreme Court decision that gave local and state governments more latitude to remove people experiencing homelessness from their streets.\n\nNewsom can't force cities and counties to dismantle homeless encampments but is advising local authorities the best way to take action.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses,\" Newsom told the New York Times. \"It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nHow Newsom's homelessness order may affect California\n\nThe governor's new homelessness directive will order other state agencies, such as Caltrans, California State Parks and the Department of Fish and Wildlife, to first target encampments that pose a health and safety risk, the New York Times reports.\n\nThose agencies will give 48 to 72 hours of advance notice to people in the encampments while working with local homeless organizations to give help to the people experiencing homelessness. Personal property collected at each site will be bagged, tagged, and stored for at least 60 days, the New York Times reports.\n\nThe state cannot legally force cities to adopt this policy, though.\n\nNewsom's office has not returned messages from the USA TODAY Network on the new policy.\n\nSome California cities are already making homelessness policy changes\n\nEven before Newsom's announcement about the state's crackdown on homeless encampments, other cities across California have made initial moves to address homelessness on their streets.\n\nIn Palm Springs, the City Council passed a sweeping new homeless enforcement ordinance in early July that grants police new power to arrest people who build encampments or sleep in public areas.\n\nLast week, San Francisco Mayor London Breed announced that city would begin \"very aggressive\" sweeps of homeless encampments in August.\n\nOther cities, including Lancaster, Fresno, Chico, Stockton and Folsom, are considering or already developing new homelessness policies.\n\nNewsom's homelessness policy change comes after passage of Proposition 1\n\nIn March, woters narrowly passed the Newsom-backed Proposition 1, which authorized the state to borrow $6.38 billion to build 4,350 housing units and add 6,800 mental health and addiction treatment beds across the state.\n\nNewsom's ambitious measure is intended to improve and expand the state's mental health services, representing one of the most significant statewide investments to manage the growing homelessness crisis.\n\nCalifornia has nearly half of the nation's unsheltered population, and nationwide surveys suggest at least 21% of those experiencing homelessness report having a serious mental illness, and 16% report having a substance use disorder. Studies and point-in-time surveys have estimated an even larger proportion of the homeless and unsheltered population have or have a history of mental health conditions or substance abuse.", "source":

Gavin Newsom ordered state agencies to begin sweeping homeless encampments on public property, using newfound authority after the U.S. Supreme Court's OK last month.\n\nIn an executive order issued Thursday morning, the governor directs agencies to remove encampments that pose a risk to \"life, health and safety.\"\n\nThe order could impact tens of thousands of people living in tent encampments across California. The latest count showed roughly 180,000 people in the state were experiencing homelessness on any given night. About 123,000 were unsheltered and sleeping in tents, vehicles or exposed to the elements.\n\nThe Newsom administration has invested $24 billion in recent years to try to shrink that number but it has only grown.\n\nNow the governor is using a new set of tools provided by a recent Supreme Court ruling that allows state and local governments to arrest or fine people camping on public property.\n\nNewsom had written a brief in support of Grants Pass, an Oregon town at the center of the case, arguing previous rulings had \"tied the hands of state and local governments to address this issue.\"\n\nBefore the ruling, cities were required to offer shelter to people sleeping on public property before citing or arresting them.\n\nUnder the new order, state agencies are still urged to partner with local governments to facilitate shelter and other supportive services before removing encampments.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets. There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nAdvocates for the unsheltered blasted the directive and said leaders need to do more to get to the root of California's stubborn homelessness problem: a severe lack of affordable housing.\n\n\"The order itself is an attempt to misdirect attention away from the people who are responsible for that affordable housing crisis, the state and local elected leaders who have permitted it to grow so bad, and to put the focus back on the individuals who are actually the victims of that failure,\" said Eric Tars, senior policy director for the National Homelessness Law Center.\n\nWhile Newsom initially campaigned for governor in 2017 on a pledge to build 3.5 million new homes, he has fallen far short of that promise.\n\nThe order directs agencies to create policies for removing encampments from state properties including parks and roadways.\n\nIt urges agencies to provide at least 48 hours notice before clearing an encampment and to label and store any personal belongings collected during the sweep for at least 60 days.\n\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg did not immediately comment on the order, but it is not expected to mark a significant shift in Sacramento's homelessness strategy.\n\nBoth the city and county adopted policies in 2022 that banned camping on public sidewalks and along the American River Parkway. Another ordinance allows officers to ticket people for storing personal items on public property. Law enforcement regularly sweeps encampments under those rules.\n\nGillian Brassil and Theresa Clift contributed reporting.\n\n____", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Homelessness_Law_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Homelessness Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_River_Parkway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American River Parkway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrell_Steinberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darrell Steinberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sidewalk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/299/29935/2993545.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom issues executive order for removal of homeless encampments in California", "body": "By Ray Sanchez, Cheri Mossburg and Stephanie Becker\n\n(CNN) -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom, buoyed by a recent US Supreme Court decision, issued an executive order Thursday calling on state officials to begin taking down homeless encampments.\n\nThe move to begin dismantling thousands of encampments throughout California comes after the high court ruled last month in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside. The ruling rejected arguments that such \"anti-camping\" ordinances violated the Constitution's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newson said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nThe order calls on state officials \"to adopt humane and dignified policies to urgently address encampments on state property.\"\n\nCalifornia has the largest homeless population - more than 180,000 people - in the nation, according to a 2023 homelessness assessment report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nAn estimated 653,100 people were experiencing homelessness nationwide - a jump of around 12% since 2022, according to the report.\n\nCalifornia's policies following the Supreme Court decision are being closely watched by other cities and states, and Newsom's order has drawn the ire of some homeless advocates and elected officials.\n\n\"Newsom could have issued this order before the (Supreme Court) decision. The only difference now is that states and localities are free to confine and arrest people even when there is no shelter available,\" said Chris Herring, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California Los Angeles.\n\n\"So before the Supreme Court ruling cities were in the position where they would have to provide shelter offers before removing encampments. Now ... they will be able to carry out these encampment sweeps with the very real threat of issuing people incredibly expensive fines of which people cannot pay and often results in a warrant or an arrest or can result in incarceration.\"\n\nHerring said the timing of the order wasn't surprising as Newsom seeks to \"politically clear his name of the homeless crisis, especially as he's in the national spotlight right now amid the presidential election.\"\n\nIn San Francisco, a spokesperson for Mayor London Breed said the city had already started to take action.\n\n\"Our city encampment teams and street outreach staff have been going out every day to bring people indoors, and to clean and clear encampments,\" spokesperson Parisa Safarzadeh told CNN in a statement. \"This is why we are seeing a five year low in the City's tent count on our streets.\"\n\nBut Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, called Newsom's executive order \"a punch in the gut.\"\n\nShe said there are already thousands of people on a waitlist for housing, and all shelter beds in San Francisco are already full.\n\n\"They want to basically crack down on folks who have no other choice,\" she said.\n\nLate last month, the results of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority's point-in-time count - conducted in January - showed the homeless population in Los Angeles had dropped for the first time in six years. It showed overall homelessness and in particular unsheltered homelessness was down in both Los Angeles County and the city. According to the count, homelessness was down 2.2% in the Los Angeles and 0.27% in the county.\n\nThere were still 45,253 homeless people counted in the city and 75,312 people unhoused in the county, the authority reported.\n\n\"For the first time in years, unsheltered homelessness has decreased in Los Angeles because of a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Thursday.\n\n\"Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work.\"\n\nIn fact, a new study by the Rand Corp's Center on Housing and Homelessness found encampment clearing efforts in Los Angeles had no long-term effect on the number of people on the streets.\n\nThe researchers looked at encampment cleanups in Venice, Hollywood and Skid Row in Los Angeles and \"observed temporary declines in the unsheltered population that lasted two to three months on average\" before returning to previous levels, according to the study.\n\nIn Venice, for instance, encampment removals meant \"the share of unhoused people living literally unsheltered (e.g., without a tent) increased from 20 percent to 46 percent,\" the study said.\n\nNewsom last month praised the high court's ruling, saying it \"provides state and local officials the definitive authority to implement and enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments from our streets.\"\n\n\"This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities,\" Newsom added.\n\nThe case was the most significant appeal involving unhoused Americans to reach the Supreme Court in decades, and it was closely watched by cities and states across the nation wrestling with a sharp increase in homelessness.\n\nLA County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said Newsom \"rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals.\"\n\n\"Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by County government,\" Barger said in a statement. \"This formula, which is largely based on partnerships, is how we can deliver permanent results. No single entity can achieve that.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\n\"It is imperative to act with urgency to address dangerous encampments, which subject unsheltered individuals living in them to extreme weather, fires, predatory and criminal activity, and widespread substance use, harming their health, safety, and well-being, and which also threaten the safety and viability of nearby businesses and neighborhoods and undermine the cleanliness and usability of parks, water supplies, and other public resources,\" he noted in his executive order.\n\nNewsom's office said the governor has made record-level investments to address the housing crisis, investing over 24 billion U.S. dollars across multiple state agencies and departments, including billions of dollars in funding to assist local jurisdictions in providing services and wrap-around support to people living in encampments.\n\nIn Fiscal Year 2022-2023, these investments helped lift more than 165,000 people out of homelessness and into interim or permanent housing, the news release added.\n\nThe order came weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court decision ruled in June that local governments have the authority to ban people from sleeping and camping in public places.\n\nCalifornia had 181,399 homeless people in January 2023, an increase of 5.8 percent from 2022, according to a national report released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last December. According to the report, California's homeless population accounted for 28 percent of the nation's total, by far the largest among all 50 states and Washington, D.C.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Housing and Urban Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 13, "textEnd": 20}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered state agencies to remove homeless encampments from public property in one of the most sweeping reactions to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing such bans.\n\nNewsom said he issued the executive order because the makeshift camps, which lack electricity and running water, pose an urgent public health and safety hazard.\n\nThe move was met with skepticism from homeless services providers who said it would do nothing to solve the crisis in a state with some of the most expensive housing in the country and with applause from some cities and counties that said they would follow suit and clear their own streets and sidewalks.\n\n\"That has been the biggest concern all along,\" said John Maceri, CEO of the Los Angeles-based social services provider The People Concern. \"The broom theory of sweeping people from here to there, it doesn't solve anybody's problem.\"\n\nThe executive order requires state agencies, such as the California State Parks department, to prioritize clearing encampments that pose the greatest safety risks and directs them to provide notice and to connect people living in the encampments with service providers that can help them store their belongings for at least 60 days.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses,\" Newsom said in his announcement. \"It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nMaceri said he was encouraged by Newsom's emphasis on including service providers as part of the overall solution, but cautioned the order could embolden cities and counties that chose to criminalize homelessness.\n\nThe governor's office did not respond to a request for comment about where the homeless people would go once the encampments were cleared.\n\nCalifornia has the country's largest homeless population, at 180,000, and it has poured $24 billion into cleaning up streets and finding housing for people, according to Newsom's office.\n\nDespite those efforts, tents and cardboard shelters remain visible throughout the state in large urban centers, suburban cities and rural communities.\n\nLast month, Los Angeles City Council President Paul Krekorian released a video showing police officers from neighboring Burbank abandoning an injured homeless man outside his office, saying such acts of \"dumping\" were a growing problem in his district.\n\nNewsom's order provides guidance to cities and counties, and some local officials said they would follow suit in light of last month's Supreme Court decision, which rejected a constitutional challenge to ordinances in Grants Pass, Oregon, that punish homeless people for sleeping on public property.\n\nThe justices ruled in favor of Grants Pass, saying the measures do not violate the Constitution's Eighth Amendment barring cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed said recently that her city will start an \"aggressive\" campaign next month to clear encampments.\n\n\"San Francisco is already doing what the Governor is calling for, with efforts well underway since long before the Grants Pass ruling,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"We've made significant investments in shelter and housing, and consistent daily outreach continues to offer services and support. This proactive approach has led to a five-year low in our street tent count.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass responded to Newsom's directive by saying the state's largest city does not criminalize homelessness as a means to solve to the crisis.\n\n\"For the first time in years, unsheltered homelessness has decreased in Los Angeles because of a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization,\" she said in a statement. \"Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work.\"\n\nIn a social media post, former Los Angeles City Council member Mike Bonin said the order was \"horrible,\" while California Assembly Member Alex Lee said sweeping away encampments is both ineffective and \"morally wrong.\"\n\nBut Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger struck a different tone, applauding Newsom and saying state agencies have a duty to solve the crisis.\n\n\"Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by County government,\" she said in an emailed statement. \"This formula, which is largely based on partnerships, is how we can deliver permanent results. No single entity can achieve that.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom",

Gavin Newsom (D) is set to sign an executive order to push state officials to start dismantling the vast homeless encampments that plague the state, following the recent Supreme Court (SCOTUS) ruling that doing so is not \"cruel and unusual punishment\" under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nMembers of Newsom's administration said that agencies around the state will be ordered to act \"with urgency and dignity\" on Thursday, the New York Times reported.\n\nWhile the executive order cannot force local Californian governments to ramp up the anti-encampment enforcement, Newsom is reportedly set to \"exert political pressure through billions of dollars the state controls for municipalities to address homelessness.\"\n\nThe move comes after the late June City of Grants Pass v. Johnson ruling, which stemmed from an Oregon city's ban on homeless residents sleeping outdoors being challenged.\n\nIn writing for the majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch expressed sympathy for homeless people and the complexity of the issue but said that laws against encampments were \"commonplace\" and argued that the Eighth Amendment was a \"poor foundation\" on which to challenge them.\n\nGorsuch opined that the right forum in which to debate responses to homelessness was in democratically elected governments, not federal courts.\n\n\"Today's ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court provides state and local officials the definitive authority to implement and enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments from our streets,\" Newsom said in a June 28 press release. \"This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities.\"\n\n\"California remains committed to respecting the dignity and fundamental human needs of all people and the state will continue to work with compassion to provide individuals experiencing homelessness with the resources they need to better their lives,\" the governor added.\n\nWhile Newsom approved of the ruling, some mayors around his state expressed disappointment.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D) denounced the SCOTUS decision as an \"excuse\" for cities to \"arrest their way\" out of the homelessness crisis:\n\nToday's decision is not surprising given the make-up of the Court but disappointing nonetheless. This ruling must not be used as an excuse for cities across the country to attempt to arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail. Neither will work, neither will save lives and that route is more expensive for taxpayers than actually solving the problem.\n\nThe only way to address this crisis is to bring people indoors with housing and supportive services. In the City of Los Angeles, we will continue leading with this approach, which helped move thousands more Angelenos inside last year than the year before. We cannot go backwards - we must continue innovating and moving with intention and urgency until every person experiencing homelessness is able to access housing, services and support.\n\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed (D), on the other hand, has signaled her support for the ruling and Newsom's incoming anti-encampment policies, saying that city officials plan to become \"very aggressive and assertive in moving encampments\" starting in August and might start citing homeless people who refuse offers of shelter.\n\nLancaster Mayor R. Rex Parris (R) said he began \"warming up the bulldozer\" after the SCOTUS decision, the Times reported.\n\nThe outlet estimated that 180,000 people were homeless in California in 2023 -- most of them without shelter.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said in a statement that the publication obtained.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses.

It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nWhile Newsom's executive order does not force cities or counties to clear out more camps, it aims to provide a blueprint for responding to street homelessness while \"respecting the dignity and well-being of all Californians.\"\n\n\"We're eager to work with the state to responsibly and quickly remove encampments from state property in San Jose, especially those adjacent to neighborhoods and in dangerous areas along our freeways and on- and off-ramps,\" said San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan in a statement.\n\nMahan has pushed the city to take a tougher stance on encampments while also building new temporary homeless shelters, including tiny homes.\n\n\"Here in San Jose we're working around the clock to stand up safe, managed placements and require they be used - we appreciate Governor Newsom's order signaling that the state is also ready to solve this crisis with both compassion and urgency,\" Mahan said.\n\nAcross California, some 181,000 people experience homelessness on a given night, almost 30% of the nation's unhoused population. The nine-county Bay Area has an estimated 37,000 homeless residents.\n\nThe Supreme Court's 6-3 decision in June granted officials broad authority to clear homeless encampments even when those living on the street have nowhere else to go.\n\nSince 2018, lower court rulings had prevented local governments in California and throughout the West from arresting or fining people for sleeping on public property if beds weren't available in homeless shelters. When cities moved to shut down an encampment, they were generally expected to offer everyone living there \"adequate shelter.\"\n\nOfficials across party lines from San Francisco to San Diego argued the shelter requirement had hamstrung efforts to close dangerous tent and vehicle camps and exacerbated the crisis. They had urged the high court to allow more flexibility in clearing and managing encampments - and many, including Newsom, celebrated the high court's ruling.\n\nAdvocates for homeless people, however, argue the ruling could clear the way for officials to \"criminalize homelessness\" without addressing the root causes of the crisis.", "source": {"uri": "heraldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_varian@heraldonline.com", "name": "Ethan Varian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mahan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Mahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_shelter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homeless shelter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Officiating", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Runaways", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Runaways", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/5ez7np/picture290426639/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/8095d03d-774d-4afe-b121-ab3e469c7fd4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

(Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., is using the legal shield provided by a recent Supreme Court decision to formally grant legal authorities the right to clear homeless encampments from public spaces, The New York Times reported Thursday.\n\nIn an executive order, Newsom instructed California officials to begin dismantling thousands of such homeless encampments, according to officials in his administration, instructing state and local authorities to act on the recent Supreme Court decision.\n\n\"We must act with urgency to address dangerous encampments, which subject unsheltered individuals living in them to extreme weather, fires, predatory and criminal activity, and widespread substance use, harming their health, safety, and well-being, and which also threaten the safety and viability of nearby businesses and neighborhoods, and undermine the cleanliness and usability of parks, water supplies, and other public resources,\" Newsome wrote.\n\nIn June, the Supreme Court considered whether authorities can criminalize people without homes from sleeping and camping in public places, NPR News reported. In a 6-3 ruling, the court's right-wing majority decided that homelessness can indeed be defined as a crime and people punished for sleeping outside, even when there are no available alternatives for those experiencing extreme poverty.\n\nAt the time, Newsom released a statement praising the court's ruling: \"This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities.\"\n\nNewsom's praise contrasted with liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor's take on what she termed an \"unconscionable\" decision.\n\n\"It is possible to acknowledge and balance the issues facing local governments, the humanity and dignity of homeless people, and our constitutional principles,\" Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. \"Instead, the majority focuses almost exclusively on the needs of local governments and leaves the most vulnerable in our society with an impossible choice: Either stay awake or be arrested.\"\n\nHomeless encampments have been a persistent issue in California for quite some time. The state has the highest unhoused population in the country, with about 180,000 people sleeping on the streets last year. A recent count showed that approximately, 123,000 people were unsheltered on any given night, the Times reported.\n\nIn his State of the State address on Thursday, Newsom addressed the issue of homelessness and said he remains committed to providing the state's unhoused population with alternatives to living on the street.\n\n\"No state has done as much as California in addressing the pernicious problem of homelessness that too many politicians have ignored for too long,\" he said. \"While the causes of homelessness are indeed complex, the solution is rather simple: housing and supportive services.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extreme poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_State_address", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of the State address"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2024/07/gavin_newsom_2095082610_v02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom issues executive order for removal of homeless encampments in California - WSVN 7News | Miami News, Weather, Sports | Fort Lauderdale", "body": "(CNN) -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom, buoyed by a recent US Supreme Court decision, issued an executive order Thursday calling on state officials to begin taking down homeless encampments.\n\nThe move to begin dismantling thousands of encampments throughout California comes after the high court ruled last month in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside. The ruling rejected arguments that such \"anti-camping\" ordinances violated the Constitution's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newson said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nThe order calls on state officials \"to adopt humane and dignified policies to urgently address encampments on state property.\"\n\nThe move has drawn the ire of homeless advocates and elected officials.\n\n\"Newsom could have issued this order before the (Supreme Court) decision. The only difference now is that states and localities are free to confine and arrest people even when there is no shelter available,\" said Chris Herring, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California Los Angeles.\n\n\"So before the Supreme Court ruling cities were in the position where they would have to provide shelter offers before removing encampments. Now ... they will be able to carry out these encampment sweeps with the very real threat of issuing people incredibly expensive fines of which people cannot pay and often results in a warrant or an arrest or can result in incarceration.\"\n\nHerring said the timing of the order wasn't surprising as Newsom seeks to \"politically clear his name of the homeless crisis, especially as he's in the national spotlight right now amid the presidential election.\"\n\nIn San Francisco, a spokesperson for Mayor London Breed said the city had already started to take action.\n\n\"Our city encampment teams and street outreach staff have been going out every day to bring people indoors, and to clean and clear encampments,\" spokesperson Parisa Safarzadeh told CNN in a statement. \"This is why we are seeing a five year low in the City's tent count on our streets.\"\n\nStudy shows cleanups do little to change numbers of homeless\n\nLate last month, the results of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority's point-in-time count - conducted in January - showed the homeless population in Los Angeles had dropped for the first time in six years. It showed overall homelessness and in particular unsheltered homelessness was down in both Los Angeles County and the city. According to the count, homelessness was down 2.2% in the Los Angeles and 0.27% in the county.\n\nThere were still 45,253 homeless people counted in the city and 75,312 people unhoused in the county, the authority reported.\n\n\"For the first time in years, unsheltered homelessness has decreased in Los Angeles because of a comprehensive approach that leads with housing and services, not criminalization,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Thursday.\n\n\"Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work.\"\n\nIn fact, a new study by the Rand Corp's Center on Housing and Homelessness found encampment clearing efforts in Los Angeles had no long-term effect on the number of people on the streets.\n\nThe researchers looked at encampment cleanups in Venice, Hollywood and Skid Row in Los Angeles and \"observed temporary declines in the unsheltered population that lasted two to three months on average\" before returning to previous levels, according to the study.\n\nIn Venice, for instance, encampment removals meant \"the share of unhoused people living literally unsheltered (e.g., without a tent) increased from 20 percent to 46 percent,\" the study said.\n\nNewsom last month praised the high court's ruling, saying it \"provides state and local officials the definitive authority to implement and enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments from our streets.\"\n\n\"This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities,\" Newsom added.\n\nThe case was the most significant appeal involving unhoused Americans to reach the Supreme Court in decades, and it was closely watched by cities and states across the nation wrestling with a sharp increase in homelessness.\n\nLA County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said Newsom \"rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals.\"\n\n\"Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by County government,\" Barger said in a statement. \"This formula, which is largely based on partnerships, is how we can deliver permanent results. No single entity can achieve that.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

But once in a while, even a blind squirrel finds a nut, and California Governor Gavin Newsom illustrated that idiom on Thursday when, leveraging a recent Supreme Court decision, he ordered a cleanup of the homeless encampments that are plaguing the Golden State.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom will order California state officials on Thursday to begin dismantling thousands of homeless encampments, according to members of his administration, the nation's most sweeping response to a recent Supreme Court ruling that gave governments greater authority to remove homeless people from their streets.\n\nHomeless encampments have vexed California, where housing costs are among the nation's highest, more than any other state. An estimated 180,000 people were homeless last year in California, and most of them were unsheltered. Unlike New York City, most jurisdictions in California do not guarantee a right to housing.\n\nGavin Newsom's record as California's Governor has been mixed, at best; he has never seen a tax increase he wasn't in favor of, he favors economy-wrecking \"green\" energy policies, and he seems to have his eye firmly fixed on national office, neglecting California in the process.\n\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: 1) Agencies and departments subject to my authority shall adopt policies, generally consistent with California Department of transportation's Maintenance Policy Directive 1001-R1, to address encampments on state property, including through partnerships with other state and local agencies, and shall prioritize efforts to address encampments consistent with such policy.\n\n\"Addressing\" these encampments, as you look through the entire order, may be interpreted to mean, \"Enough is enough -- we aren't going to allow you to camp on the streets and in public parks any longer.\"\n\nThis new policy is based on a Supreme Court decision, \"City of Grants Pass, Oregon v. Johnson et al.\"\n\nSee Related: Supreme Court Rules Homeless Do Not Have a Right to Camp on Public Property\n\nWhile it remains to be seen how rigorously this will be enforced, it's a good first step. The homeless encampments that have, as the New York Times piece linked above aptly puts it, vexed California for years have to be addressed. There are not only criminal issues arising from these camps, with everything from retail theft to trespassing to drug dealing, but there are also serious public health issues involved. These encampments are vectors of typhus, tuberculosis, and bubonic plague, as well as norovirus, the various forms of hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases, and parasites.\n\nThere may have been a Supreme Court decision enabling this, but it's long overdue, and it's hard to credit the idea that the grave public health concerns didn't make this a mandatory reaction well before this. But at least now, it's happening, which begs the question:\n\nWhere will they put all the people in these encampments? Ay, that's the rub. Governor Newsom's order doesn't seem to have much to say about where the displaced people will be moved to; California likely doesn't have enough shelter space to house a little over 181,000 homeless people.\n\nThe cynical among us may well think that many of the displaced will head to Oregon, where Portland also has a sizable homeless encampment problem.\n\nThis is a start. It's good to see Gavin Newsom, for once, engaging in a policy that makes a certain amount of sense. It will be interesting to see how many other blue-state governors follow suit.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered state agencies to ramp up encampment sweeps and urged local governments to do the same.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nWhile Newsom's executive order would not force cities or counties to clear out more camps, it aims to provide a blueprint for responding to street homelessness while \"respecting the dignity and well-being of all Californians.\"\n\n\"We're eager to work with the state to responsibly and quickly remove encampments from state property in San Jose, especially those adjacent to neighborhoods and in dangerous areas along our freeways and on- and off-ramps,\" said San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan in a statement.\n\nMahan, who's pushed the city to take a tougher stance on encampments while also building new temporary homeless shelters, including tiny homes.\n\n\"Here in San Jose we're working around the clock to stand up safe, managed placements and require they be used -- we appreciate Governor Newsom's order signaling that the state is also ready to solve this crisis with both compassion and urgency.\"\n\nAcross California, some 181,000 people experience homelessness on a given night, almost 30% of the nation's unhoused population. The nine-county Bay Area has an estimated 37,000 homeless residents.\n\nThe Supreme Court's 6-3 decision in June granted officials broad authority to clear homeless encampments even when those living on the street have nowhere else to go.\n\nSince 2018, lower court rulings had prevented local governments in California and throughout the West from arresting or fining people for sleeping on public property if beds weren't available in homeless shelters. When cities moved to shut down an encampment, they were generally expected to offer everyone living there shelter or housing.\n\nOfficials across party lines from San Francisco to San Diego argued the shelter requirement had hamstrung efforts to close dangerous tent and vehicle camps and exacerbated the crisis. They had urged the high court to allow more flexibility in clearing and managing encampments -- and many, including Newsom, celebrated the high court's ruling.\n\nAdvocates for homeless people, however, argue the ruling could clear the way for officials to \"criminalize homelessness\" without addressing the root causes of the crisis.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_varian@mercurynews.com", "name": "Ethan Varian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mahan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Mahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_shelter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homeless shelter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24174661663315.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom, buoyed by a recent US Supreme Court decision, issued an executive order Thursday calling on state officials to begin taking down homeless encampments.\n\nThe move to begin dismantling thousands of encampments throughout California comes after the high court ruled last month in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside. The ruling rejected arguments that such \"anti-camping\" ordinances violated the Constitution's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newson said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\" ... The order calls on state officials \"to adopt humane and dignified policies to urgently address encampments on state property.\"\n\nThe move has drawn the ire of homeless advocates and elected officials. ... \"Newsom could have issued this order before the (Supreme Court) decision. The only difference now is that states and localities are free to confine and arrest people even when there is no shelter available,\" said Chris Herring, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California Los Angeles.\n\n{snip}\n\nRead more: https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/gavin-newsom-executive-order-homeless-encampments/index.html", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ordinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local ordinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sociology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom urged local authorities to use a recent Supreme Court decision to aggressively clear encampments, but several Los Angeles County leaders said they don't plan on changing their approach to homelessness in response to the ruling.\n\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court's decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson gave municipalities the right to enforce anti-camping laws and ticket people for sleeping in public.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and L.A. County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath condemned the decision, saying it would criminalize homeless people and shuffle people from community to community without addressing the overal crisis.\n\nBut Newsom has issued an executive order to state agencies to use the decision to adopt policies that \"urgently address encampments on state property\" and strongly encouraged local municipalities to follow suit.\n\n\"In the past the courts have denied the ability for local government, including the state, to clean up many of these encampments,\" Newsom said, arguing that this left unhoused people exposed to criminal activity, widespread substance use and fire danger.\n\n\"It's time to move with urgency at the local level to clean up these sites, to focus on public health, focus on public safety,\" he continued. \"There are no longer any excuses.\"\n\nWhile Newsom cannot order local authorities to act, his administration can apply pressure -- by withholding money for counties and cities.\n\nNewsom's executive order does not require that state agencies or municipalities use anti-camping laws to clear encampments, but rather that they develop their own policies to quickly dismantle the tent cities and RV encampments.\n\nBut some leaders and homeless service providers are concerned about how the order will be applied in practice.\n\nKatie Tell, chief external affairs officer for People Assisting the Homeless (PATH), criticized Newsom's order and that homeless service providers were not consulted.\n\n\"We worry the executive order is likely to push vulnerable residents off State property into cities and counties without any financial or housing support for those localities and their homeless service provider partners,\" she said in a Tuesday morning statement. \"Without resources dedicated to interim and permanent housing, this policy will not only be counterproductive but will set our efforts back tremendously.\"\n\nOn the other hand, L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said, \"I applaud Governor Newsom's emphasis on urgency.\"\n\n\"He rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals,\" Barger said. \"Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by county government.\"\n\nIn July, Mayor Karen Bass said L.A. would not change its approach to clearing encampments in response to the Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\"This ruling must not be used as an excuse for cities across the country to attempt to arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail,\" Bass said after the Supreme Court's decision. \"Neither will work, neither will save lives and that route is more expensive for taxpayers than actually solving the problem.\"\n\nBass has long touted her model of clearing encampments under the \"Inside Safe Program,\" which does not use anti-camping laws, but offers every targeted homeless person a guaranteed temporary housing placement.\n\nSince its launch in December 2022, Inside Safe has cleared 52 encampments and moved more than 2,800 people indoors without issuing citations for camping in public. In August, 2023 the L.A. County Board of Supervisors launched a similar program called Pathway Home.\n\nLast month, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) announced the total yearly count of homeless people in the Los Angeles region had dropped slightly in 2024, reversing a five-year trend of growth.\n\nCounty officials were quick to say that was evidence that their approach is working.\n\n\"For so many years, the count has shown increases in homelessness, and we have all felt that in our neighborhoods,\" Bass said when the results of the count were announced. \"But we leaned into change. And we have changed the trajectory of this crisis and have moved L.A. in a new direction.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "clara_harter@dailynews.com", "name": "Clara Harter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karen Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recreational vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Homeless_Services_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Barger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kathryn Barger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/LPT-L-HOMELESS-LB-0629-02.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Local agencies are \"encouraged\" to do the same. The order notes the state has provided \"historic investments and intervention programs\" to address homelessness.\n\nThe order gives some guidance for what those policies should look like:\n\nUnless there's an \"imminent threat to life, health, safety or infrastructure,\" officials are directed to give those in encampments at least 48 hours warning before the area is cleared. Officials are also directed to contact homelessness outreach services providers and to collect, label and store personal items taken from the camps for at least 60 days, unless they're found to be health or safety hazards.\n\nThe order notes that an estimated 180,000 Californians experience homelessness every night in California. That's about 455 people per 100,000 California residents.\n\nNewsom's announcement follows a June 28 U.S. Supreme Court decision, City of Grants Pass, Oregon v.

to address the crisis on their streets.\"\n\nBut following the Grants Pass decision, \"there is no longer any barrier to local governments utilizing the substantial resources provided by the state, in tandem with federal and local resources, to address encampments with both urgency and humanity, or excuse for not doing so,\" Newsom writes in the order.\n\nThe news release issued by Newsom's office notes the \"unprecedented\" amount of resources available to help local governments combat homelessness.\n\nWhat this all means for efforts in Riverside and San Bernardino counties is unclear.\n\n\"The county will determine if the governor's announcement suggests anything beyond what the county and its partners are already doing,\" San Bernardino County spokesperson David Wert wrote in an email Thursday.\n\nSan Bernardino County's current efforts already include using state, federal and local funding \"to create housing and shelter opportunities; addressing the root causes of homelessness such as mental health and substance use disorder; reaching out directly to the unsheltered where they are living to deliver services; and clearing out encampments where they create a threat of wildfire,\" he noted.\n\nJust clearing encampments isn't going to solve the state's homelessness crisis, Riverside County Fifth District Supervisor Yxstian Gutierrez said Thursday\n\n\"Studies are out there that just cleaning out encampments doesn't fix everything -- you have to provide employment and housing, too,\" Gutierrez said.\n\nThe number of people living without permanent housing in the Inland Empire has dramatically risen over the last decade.\n\nIn Riverside County's 2023 Point In Time Count of homeless residents, the last year the county conducted such a canvass, an estimated 3,725 county residents did not have a permanent place to live, up from 2,978 in 2013.\n\nAccording to San Bernardino County's 2024 Point In Time Count of homeless residents, an estimated 3,055 county residents were living without permanent shelter, up from 2,321 in 2013.\n\nUsing 2023 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates, that means about 149 out of every 100,000 Riverside County residents and about 139 of every 100,000 San Bernardino County residents do not have a consistent place to live.", "source": {"uri": "sbsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Gavin Newsom is calling on local governments such as San Jose to use state funds for urgent action to address \"dangerous\" homeless encampments.\n\nNewsom's executive order on Thursday suggests notifying homeless residents at least 48 hours before an incoming sweep. Locally, San Jose tends to give more notice, as officials want to enforce a scaled approach. First, the city offers resources and shelter repeatedly to homeless people living in camps. Those who refuse services will be swept and lastly, unhoused people can be cited or arrested. The city is in the process of clearing and finding housing for hundreds of people living along its waterways.\n\nThe executive order comes weeks after a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court ruled cities can legally ban homeless residents from sleeping on public property -- and it could be the start of Newsom's push to appear tough on encampments as his name is floated for vice president.\n\n\"It sounds like Newsom is posturing for a role in the potential Kamala Harris administration,\" Todd Langton, executive director of homeless advocacy nonprofit Agape Silicon Valley, told San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight. \"He knows he's got baggage, so to speak, with California homelessness, crime and all of that. I believe he's making this big declaration to appear more conservative.\"\n\nThursday's executive order also said state agencies should make plans to clear homeless camps from state property. Newsom is directing agencies to model their sweeps after Caltrans. California has cleared out more than 11,000 encampments since July 2021.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said. \"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nCaltrans spokesperson Edward Barrera said Newsom's executive order won't affect the transit agency's existing encampment removal operations, but hopes it will encourage more local agencies to ramp up their efforts.\n\n\"Caltrans is responsible for maintaining the state's transportation network, including protecting and maintaining the highway infrastructure, and understands that to solve the state's homelessness crisis, it takes state and local agencies working collaboratively to devise sustainable, equitable solutions,\" he told San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight.\n\nNewsom's announcement makes no mention of permanent housing, though recommendations from advocates in groups like Santa Clara County's homelessness task force said more permanent housing is needed to truly address homelessness. For every one household in the county that is housed, nearly two become homeless.\n\nA study cited by the task force also showed the county spends more than $500 million per year addressing homelessness.\n\nIn San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan and councilmembers voted earlier this year to invest millions more in Measure E funds to tackle encampments along the creeks and provide emergency temporary housing. A state audit found between fiscal years 2020 and 2023 San Jose spent more than $302 million on homeless support services -- about $88.6 million came from state funds.\n\nBut Newsom said local governments now have the necessary tools and authority to take on encampments in light of the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nMahan said he and fellow city officials are working around the clock to develop safe, managed placements and require they be used.\n\n\"We're eager to work with the state to responsibly and quickly remove encampments from state property in San Jose, especially those adjacent to neighborhoods and in dangerous areas along our freeways and on- and off-ramps,\" he told San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight. \"We appreciate Gov. Newsom's order signaling that the state is also ready to solve this crisis with both compassion and urgency.\"\n\nLangton said he supports Mahan's efforts to launch more temporary housing and safe sleeping sites, but the process needs to speed up.\n\n\"We don't need those sites a year or two from now, we need them immediately -- especially with the accelerated program Newsom wants to launch,\" Langton told San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight.", "source": {"uri": "sanjosespotlight.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vicente_vera@sanjosespotlight.com", "name": "Vicente Vera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jose, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jos\u00e9,_Costa_Rica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Costa Rica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mahan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Mahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://sanjosespotlight.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20180626/IMG_3599-1200x630.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., is using the legal shield provided by a recent Supreme Court decision to formally grant legal authorities the right to clear homeless encampments from public spaces, The New York Times reported Thursday.\n\nIn an executive order, Newsom instructed California officials to begin dismantling thousands of such homeless encampments, according to officials in his administration, instructing state and local authorities to act on the recent Supreme Court decision.\n\n\"We must act with urgency to address dangerous encampments, which subject unsheltered individuals living in them to extreme weather, fires, predatory and criminal activity, and widespread substance use, harming their health, safety, and well-being, and which also threaten the safety and viability of nearby businesses and neighborhoods, and undermine the cleanliness and usability of parks, water supplies, and other public resources,\" Newsome wrote.\n\nIn June, the Supreme Court considered whether authorities can criminalize people without homes from sleeping and camping in public places, NPR News reported. In a 6-3 ruling, the court's right-wing majority decided that homelessness can indeed be defined as a crime and people punished for sleeping outside, even when there are no available alternatives for those experiencing extreme poverty.\n\nAt the time, Newsom released a statement praising the court's ruling: \"This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities.\"\n\nNewsom's praise contrasted with liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor's take on what she termed an \"unconscionable\" decision.\n\n\"It is possible to acknowledge and balance the issues facing local governments, the humanity and dignity of homeless people, and our constitutional principles,\" Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. \"Instead, the majority focuses almost exclusively on the needs of local governments and leaves the most vulnerable in our society with an impossible choice: Either stay awake or be arrested.\"\n\nHomeless encampments have been a persistent issue in California for quite some time. The state has the highest unhoused population in the country, with about 180,000 people sleeping on the streets last year. A recent count showed that approximately, 123,000 people were unsheltered on any given night, the Times reported.\n\nIn his State of the State address on Thursday, Newsom addressed the issue of homelessness and said he remains committed to providing the state's unhoused population with alternatives to living on the street.\n\n\"No state has done as much as California in addressing the pernicious problem of homelessness that too many politicians have ignored for too long,\" he said. \"While the causes of homelessness are indeed complex, the solution is rather simple: housing and supportive services.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extreme poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_State_address", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of the State address"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Q08uKpMLsv.JQWpiyUBbvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/salon_articles_879/20d0f1853286ec98f00e06796f2bfc89", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom issued an executive order impacting California's homeless population.\n\nThe governor officially directed state agencies on how to remove homeless encampments across the Golden State. Put simply, the order allows local governments to decide if makeshift tent communities and shelters will be banned in their jurisdictions. This also means they can be dismantled.\n\nThis executive order comes about a month after a Supreme Court ruling allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces. Here at home in San Diego, the court's ruling influenced the legality of the city's sidewalk camping ban, which police started to enforce in July of last year.\n\nRegarding the Supreme Court's decision, Mayor Gloria previously stated, \"This ruling brings much-needed clarity to how the city can enforce our laws against unsafe encampments; however, it will not change our strategy on homelessness.\"\n\nWhile responding to the governor's executive order regarding the issue on Thursday, San Diego's mayor expressed similar sentiments. He released the following statement:\n\n\"California's Big City Mayors welcome the Governor's renewed direction and sense of urgency to address homelessness with tangible and meaningful action. The state's large cities have been leading on resolving unsafe and unsanitary encampments while simultaneously ensuring that vulnerable unsheltered residents have options available to them to move off the streets, into care and on a path to housing and better quality of life.\n\n\"All of us - mayors, other local elected officials, state leaders and housed community members - must be united in acting with purpose to create more shelter options and housing for those in need.\"\n\nMeanwhile, plans for a proposed mega shelter and another site for the unhoused appear to be moving forward in San Diego, despite growing criticism from some in the surrounding communities.\n\nWhat's next for the homeless encampments scattered along the sides of freeways, shopping centers, public parks and parking lots remains to be seen. Under Newsom's order, however, state agencies would be required to prioritize clearing encampments that pose safety risks.", "source": {"uri": "fox5sandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSWB 5/69"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amber_coakley@fox5sandiego.com", "name": "Amber Coakley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_San_Diego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of San Diego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Gloria", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Todd Gloria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KUSI-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KUSI-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://fox5sandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/05/homeesss.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom Orders Removal of Homeless Encampments", "body": "In a significant move to address the ongoing homelessness crisis in California, Governor Gavin Newsom has issued an executive order for the removal of homeless encampments across the state this Thursday. This decision comes in the wake of a recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which allows cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces.\n\nGovernor Newsom's order provides an outline to state agencies on how to effectively remove the thousands of tents and makeshift shelters that currently line freeways, clutter shopping center parking lots, and occupy city parks. However, it is important to note that the decision to remove these encampments ultimately remains in the hands of local authorities.\n\nTaking to Twitter, Governor Newsom stated, \"No more excuses. We've provided the time. We've provided the funds. Now it's time for locals to do their job.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court case, which is considered one of the most significant on the issue in decades, has sparked a nationwide debate on how to tackle the rising number of individuals without permanent housing. Cities across the country have been dealing with the politically complex issue, as public frustration over related health and safety concerns continues to mount.\n\nRELATED:Wow: Supreme Court Allows Cities To Ban Homeless Camps -- Says It Does Not Violate Constitution\n\nRELATED:Hollywood Unlocked UNCENSORED: Serge Ibaka Talks Homelessness, Keri Hilson & What He's Hiding In His Grey Sweats\n\nHomelessness has become a signature issue for Governor Newsom since taking office. Earlier this year, he campaigned for a ballot measure that would allow the state to borrow nearly $6.4 billion to construct 4,350 housing units. The timing of this order coincides with increased criticism from Republicans towards California and its handling of the homelessness crisis.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, a former California district attorney, attorney general, and senator, recently launched her presidential campaign. As she enters the race, Republicans have seized the opportunity to highlight the state's challenges with homelessness.\n\nEffectively balancing compassion for homeless individuals with the need to enforce laws and regulations can be challenging for cities. However, there are several approaches that can help achieve this balance. But while Governor Newsom believes his latest executive order is this the most strategic move to start addressing the homelessness crisis in California, organizations and groups strongly disagree.\n\nSocialites, what are your thoughts on this?

Officials should give \"reasonable\" advance notice to homeless people, offer to connect them to local services and help store their belongings for at least 60 days. Local cities and counties are urged to adopt similar protocols.\n\nLast month the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that said governments could not force people to leave encampments if there weren't any shelter beds available. The case was the most significant on the problem to come before the high court in decades. Cities across the country have been wrestling with the politically complicated task of how to deal with a rising number of people without a permanent place to live and public frustration over related health and safety issues.\n\nNewsom's administration wrote in support of cities' arguments that previous rulings, including one that barred San Francisco from clearing encampments, have prevented the state from solving a critical problem.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part,\" Newsom said in a statement Thursday.\n\nNewsom's decision garnered praise from some local elected officials and business groups, who said they were left with no options to address homeless encampments before the Supreme Court's ruling. San Francisco Mayor London Breed recently said the city will start an \"aggressive\" campaign to clear encampments across the city in August. Her office noted that the governor's order does not affect the city's operations.\n\n\"I applaud Governor Newsom's emphasis on urgency,\" Kathryn Barger, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors said in a statement. \"He rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals. Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by County government.\"\n\nEven Republican lawmakers, who have repeatedly blasted Newsom over his handling of the crisis, are rallying behind the order Thursday.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Homelessness is one of the biggest challenges we face today and it is imperative we take swift, decisive and effective action to address it,\" Republican Senator Roger Niello said in a statement. \"This executive order is a good step but it will require significant follow-through to ensure its effectiveness.\"\n\nHomeless people and advocates say the sweeps are cruel and a waste of taxpayer money. They say the answer is more housing, not crackdowns.\n\n\"You get your highway off-ramp clean for a moment only,\" Democratic Assemblymember Alex Lee said on social media. \"Without meaningful services and housing, all sweeps do is making a prominent inequality less visible.\"\n\nWhile Newsom cannot order local authorities to act, his administration can apply pressure by withholding money for counties and cities. In 2022, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in homelessness spending from local governments over the lack of progress.\n\nNewsom touted that his administration has spent roughly $24 billion cleaning up streets and housing people but acknowledged the persistent issue. Newsom's administration has also come under fire recently after a state audit found that the state didn't consistently track whether the huge amount of public money spent on this actually improved the situation.\n\nEarlier this year, Newsom threw all of his political weight behind a ballot measure to allow the state to borrow nearly $6.4 billion to build 4,350 housing units, which passed with a razor-thin margin.\n\nThe order comes as Republicans have stepped up their criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris -- a former California district attorney, attorney general and senator who just launched her presidential campaign. Harris entered the race over the weekend after President Joe Biden's announced that he would not seek reelection.\n\nNewsom himself has presidential ambitions, though he's said he wouldn't run against Harris or Biden. He has long been a top Biden campaign surrogate.\n\nThe timing of the executive order is \"curious\" given recent developments in the 2024 presidential race, California political analyst Brian Sobel said. He doubts though that Newsom's move would have much impact on Harris' campaign.\n\n\"Harris' problem isn't in California, because California is a done deal,\" he said. \"Where she needs to do well on issues like this are in swing states.\"\n\nRather, the order is a logical step for Newsom, who called himself the state's \"homeless czar,\" said Wesley Hussey, a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento.\n\n\"I don't think it's being motivated by the presidential race as much as it's definitely something that Newsom cared a lot about,\" Hussey said. \"If you're going to put it in a political context of the election, this isn't going to magically fix the problem.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nThe Democratic governor issued an executive order to direct state agencies \"to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.\"\n\nDespite the governor's order, local jurisdictions are not required to follow suit, leading to a debate among the state's Democrats, who remain divided on the issue.\n\nLike Newsom, San Francisco Mayor London Breed shares a tough approach to homelessness, saying last week the northern California city is \"going to be very aggressive and assertive in moving encampments\" beginning in August.\n\nThe head of the famously liberal city has long complained about the legal protections granted to homeless residents given prior court rulings which prevented municipalities from regulating people who camped or lived outdoors.\n\nThe US Supreme Court took up the issue from a lawsuit filed by the small town of Grants Pass, in neighboring state Oregon, which had passed two \"anti-camping\" ordinances to ban homeless residents from sleeping outdoors.\n\nWhile a US District Court had ruled in 2022 that the ordinances went against the US Constitution's prohibition of \"cruel and unusual punishment,\" the conservative-majority Supreme Court overturned the decision in late June.\n\nThe ruling was celebrated by Republicans who frequently criticize Democrats for being too lax on homelessness.\n\nUnlike her northern California counterpart, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass denounced the Supreme Court's ruling, saying it allowed \"the criminalization of people for sleeping outside when they have no other safe place to go.\"\n\nBass's homelessness policy for Los Angeles, which has the highest number of homeless residents in California, has been to increase efforts to place people in shelters.\n\nHer efforts have paid off, resulting in a 10.4 percent decrease this year in the number of residents sleeping outside.\n\nrfo/jgc/mlm", "source":

Gavin Newsom today ordered state agencies to remove homeless camps throughout California, his first major show of force since the Supreme Court granted state and local authorities more power to clear encampments.\n\nNewsom's executive order mandates that state agencies and departments adopt policies to clear camps on state property. It also encourages local governments to do the same.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newsom said in a news release. \"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets. There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nThe move comes almost a month after the U.S. Supreme Court upended six years of protections for residents of homeless encampments in California and other western states. Previously, cities were prohibited from punishing people for sleeping outside if they had nowhere else to go. As a result, local courts ordered several cities, including San Francisco, to halt or pause encampment sweeps.\n\nReversing that precedent in Grants Pass v. Johnson, the justices last month found it is not unconstitutional for a city to ban homeless encampments, even if there is no shelter available. The ruling, which Newsom cheered, gives city leaders broad authority to crack down on camps.\n\nPer Newsom's new order, state agencies are to model their encampment policies around one that Caltrans has used for several years to remove camps on highway on and off ramps, under overpasses and on other land maintained by the transit agency. State agencies should warn residents at least 48 hours before clearing a camp. They also are required to store residents' belongings for at least 60 days, and to request services for displaced residents from local organizations. If an encampment poses an \"imminent threat\" to life, health, safety or infrastructure, the agency can remove a camp immediately.\n\nCaltrans has cleared 11,188 encampments since July 2021, according to the governor's office. Newsom has personally attended some of those cleanups, wearing a baseball hat and gloves to help pick up trash left behind.\n\nBut Caltrans has faced backlash for the way it handles encampment cleanups. In 2020, the agency agreed to pay $5.5 million to settle a lawsuit that accused it of destroying property belonging to homeless Alameda County residents.\n\nNewsom took a softer tone with local governments, urging them to voluntarily adopt policies similar to the one used by Caltrans.

Newsom could withhold funding from local governments that he feels are not meeting his expectations, as he's done in the past.

Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Thursday greenlighting the removal of homeless encampments throughout the state.\n\nThe order requires state agencies and departments to adopt policies outlining removal processes for encampments on state property, which includes assessing the camp beforehand and providing advanced notice to vacate. The order follows a June Supreme Court ruling that determined states have the authority to regulate such camps.\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets. There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nNewsom's executive order requires officials to give a 48 notice to vacate when \"no exigent circumstances exist,\" according to the order. Officials are also required to store any personal belongings removed from the site for up to 60 days and direct individuals toward state resources that help combat homelessness.\n\nCalifornia has the highest homelessness rate of any state, accounting for almost 30% of the country's total homelessness, according to U.S. News and World Report, citing 2023 estimates of the Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to Congress. (RELATED: Dems Strolling Into Chicago For Convention Could End Up Getting A Taste Of The Border Crisis)\n\nCalifornia has removed over 11,000 encampments and cleared 248,275 cubic yards of debris from its streets since 2021, according to the executive order. The state has invested more than $24 billion into California's homelessness crisis since Newsom took office in 2019.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in Grants Pass v. Johnson that \"the enforcement of generally applicable laws regulating camping on public property does not constitute 'cruel and unusual punishment' prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.\" An appeals court ruled earlier this month that San Francisco could clear out its homeless camps in light of the higher court decision, lifting a December 2022 injunction that required the city to offer immediate shelter prior to taking any action.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Newsom Issues Executive Order to Remove Homeless Encampments - MyNewsLA.com", "body": "Southland elected officials were weighing in Thursday on Gov. Gavin Newsom's decision to issue an executive order for the removal of homeless encampments in the state while adding that local authorities will decide on the removals.\n\nThe guidance follows a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this summer allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses.\"\n\nNewsom's order directs state agencies to move urgently to address encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them. It also provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same.\n\n\"We must act with urgency to address dangerous encampments,\" Newsom said.\n\nThe governor added that homeless people are subjected to living in \"extreme weather, fires, predatory and criminal activity, and widespread substance use.\"\n\nWhile Newsom lacks the authority to mandate action, he can influence local decisions through the allocation of billions in state funds for homelessness initiatives.\n\n\"I applaud Governor Newsom's emphasis on urgency,\" Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said in a statement.\n\n\"He rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals. Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by county government. This formula, which is largely based on partnerships, is how we can deliver permanent results. No single entity can achieve that.\"\n\nLindsey Horvath, chair of the county Board of Supervisors and the L.A. Homeless Services Authority Commission, also commended the governor's decision.\n\n\"Los Angeles County's Pathway Home Program is doing exactly what this state order calls for -- urgent and humane encampment resolution,\" Horvath said in a statement. \"Los Angeles County is -- and has been -- all in on doing our part under our homelessness emergency.\"\n\nHorvath added that she looks forward to next week's Board of Supervisors meeting, which will discuss how the county will continue to \"coordinate and scale a regional response that delivers lasting results.\"\n\nSupervisor Hilda Solis echoed Horvath's sentiments, adding the homelessness crisis can \"only be solved with a coordinated and unified response.\" Solis said she would introduce a motion at the board's next meeting, aimed at developing a countywide strategy for addressing encampments. The proposal aims to affirm the county's \"Care First\" approach to encampment resolution, ensure that county jails will not be used to hold people arrested due to anti-camping laws, among other things.\n\n\"Moving people from one community to another does not resolve their homelessness,\" Solis said in a statement.\n\nSupervisor Janice Hahn described encampments as \"not safe\" for anyone or residents around them. Similarly to Horavth, Hahn claimed Newsom is ordering state agencies mirror what the county is doing with its Pathway Home Program and bringing people inside.\n\n\"I have asked our county departments to double down on this effort and I am celebrating the $51 million grant we received from Gov. Newsom's administration to use this strategy to address encampments along the 105 freeway. This work needs to begin as quickly as possible,\" Hahn said in a statement.\n\nIn Paris for the Olympic Games, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said that unsheltered homelessness has decreased in the city for the first time in years, citing an approach that lead with housing and services and not \"criminalization.\"\n\n\"Strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work,\" Bass said in a statement. \"We thank the governor for his partnership thus far and hope that he will continue collaboration on strategies that work.\"\n\nIn reaction to Newsom's announcement, the Republican Party of Los Angeles County posted on X, urging Mayor Bass to \"do what is necessary.\" The social media post continued, \"No more avoiding it. Do your job!\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's 6-3 decision on June 28 reversed a ruling by a San Francisco appeals court that found outdoor sleeping bans amount to cruel and unusual punishment when there is no available shelter space for the homeless. The ruling of the Supreme Court's majority found the 8th Amendment does not apply to outdoor sleeping bans.\n\nThe case originated in the rural Oregon town of Grants Pass, which appealed a ruling striking down local ordinances that fined people $295 for sleeping outside after tents began crowding public parks. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over nine Western states, ruled in 2018 that such bans violate the 8th Amendment of those who are in areas where there are not enough shelter beds.\n\n\"This ruling must not be used as an excuse for cities across the country to attempt to arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail,\" Bass said following the Supreme Court's decision. \"Neither will work, neither will save lives and that route is more expensive for taxpayers than actually solving the problem.\"\n\nLast month, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) announced the total number of people experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles region had dropped slightly in 2024, reversing a five-year upward trend -- though the numbers remain significant.\n\nSpecifically, there were 75,312 unhoused people in Los Angeles County in 2024 compared to 75,518 in 2023, a dip of 0.27%; and there were 45,252 unhoused individuals in the city of L.A. in 2024 compared to 46,260 in 2023, a drop of 2.2%.\n\nThose numbers were gathered during an annual point-in-time survey conducted by hundreds of volunteers all across the region from Jan. 24-26.", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nHis order came a month after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that cities could prohibit sleeping outside in public spaces.\n\nCalifornia's roughly 171,000 unhoused people make up a third of the homeless population of the United States. New federal data suggests the number has only increased, up 6% to 181,000 last year, the Mercury News reported in January. Many of them live in tents and makeshift shelters along freeways, in retailer parking lots and in city parks, prompting concerns about sanitation and safety.\n\nNewsom's order includes \"respecting the dignity and well-being of all Californians.\"\n\nOfficials must provide advance notice, connect those being evicted to local services, and help them store their possessions for a minimum of 60 days.

There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nExcept, you know, Newsom already made an effort to clear encampments involving state agencies. It failed because no one audited the $24 billion or kept track of stats.\n\n1) Agencies and departments subject to my authority shall adopt policies, generally consistent with California Department of Transportation's Maintenance Policy Directive 1001-R1, to address encampments on state property, including through partnerships with other state and local agencies, and shall prioritize efforts to address encampments consistent with such policy. Such policies shall include the following:\n\na. Whenever feasible, site assessment in advance of removal operations to determine whether an encampment poses an imminent threat to life, health, safety or infrastructure such that exigent circumstances require immediate removal of the encampment.\n\nb. Where exigent circumstances exist, as much advance notice to vacate as reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nc. Where no exigent circumstances exist, posting of a notice to vacate at the site at least 48 hours prior to initiating removal.\n\nd. Contacting of service providers to request outreach services for persons experiencing homelessness at the encampment.\n\ne. Collection, labeling, and storage for at least 60 days of personal property collected at the removal site that is not a health or safety hazard.\n\nLocal governments can apply for a $3.3. billion grant \"to expand the behavioral health continuum and provide appropriate care to individuals experiencing mental health conditions and substance use disorders.\"\n\nThe $3.3 billion comes from Proposition 1, which has $6.4 billion to treat and house those with severe mental illnesses and $950 million on housing interventions.\n\nRemember when the left lost their minds when SCOTUS ruled that cities could remove homeless encampments after a 24-hour notice?\n\nDo you think Newsom will receive the same outrage? I doubt it.\n\nWell, they might go crazy on Newsom. He admits in his EO that he urged SCOTUS to review City of Grants Pass v. Johnson.\n\nLeslie has done a great job keeping us updated on the homeless problem in California, including the $24 billion failure.\n\nSo, again, how is Newsom's E.O. any different or better than his other efforts to tackle the homeless problem?\n\nCoronado Mayor Richard Bailey, a Republican, ended the city's homeless problem in 2023.\n\nThe city doesn't tolerate any basic code violations but works with police to get people the help they need:\n\nBailey explained that the city works with the police department and a homeless service provider to give the homeless only one option -- to get the help they need.\n\nCoronado funds \"reasonable\" services to help those struggling get \"back on their feet,\" but noted the city also has a no-tolerance policy for violating municipal codes.\n\nUnfortunately, many homeless people have mental health problems.

Gavin Newsom's decision to issue an executive order for the removal of homeless encampments in the state while adding that local authorities will decide on the removals.\n\nThe guidance follows a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this summer allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses.\"\n\nNewsom's order directs state agencies to move urgently to address encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them. It also provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same.\n\n\"We must act with urgency to address dangerous encampments,\" Newsom said.\n\nThe governor added that homeless people are subjected to living in \"extreme weather, fires, predatory and criminal activity, and widespread substance use.\"\n\nWhile Newsom lacks the authority to mandate action, he can influence local decisions through the allocation of billions in state funds for homelessness initiatives.\n\n\"I applaud Governor Newsom's emphasis on urgency,\" Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said in a statement.\n\n\"He rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals. Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by county government. This formula, which is largely based on partnerships, is how we can deliver permanent results. No single entity can achieve that.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's 6-3 decision on June 28 reversed a ruling by a San Francisco appeals court that found outdoor sleeping bans amount to cruel and unusual punishment when there is no available shelter space for the homeless. The ruling of the Supreme Court's majority found the 8th Amendment does not apply to outdoor sleeping bans.\n\nThe case originated in the rural Oregon town of Grants Pass, which appealed a ruling striking down local ordinances that fined people $295 for sleeping outside after tents began crowding public parks. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over nine Western states, ruled in 2018 that such bans violate the 8th Amendment of those who are in areas where there are not enough shelter beds.\n\n\"This ruling must not be used as an excuse for cities across the country to attempt to arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said following the Supreme Court's decision. \"Neither will work, neither will save lives and that route is more expensive for taxpayers than actually solving the problem.\"\n\nLast month, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) announced the total number of people experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles region had dropped slightly in 2024, reversing a five-year upward trend -- though the numbers remain significant.\n\nSpecifically, there were 75,312 unhoused people in Los Angeles County in 2024 compared to 75,518 in 2023, a dip of 0.27%; and there were 45,252 unhoused individuals in the city of L.A. in 2024 compared to 46,260 in 2023, a drop of 2.2%.\n\nThose numbers were gathered during an annual point-in-time survey conducted

The order comes in response to a recent Supreme Court ruling that expanded local government authority to remove homeless people from their streets, citing that encampment removal does not violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nHomelessness has long troubled California, the state with the highest median home price in the nation. The state's estimated homeless population of 180,000 makes up roughly one-third of the nation's total. According to the 2024 Santa Barbara County point-in-time count -- an annual census that takes a snapshot of people experiencing homelessness -- an estimated 2,119 people were experiencing homelessness in the county, a 12% increase from the 2023 count. Of those without homes in Santa Barbara County, the county findings show that 1,332 were unsheltered.\n\nNewsom's order is the most sweeping response to the Supreme Court ruling, which allows cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces. \"No more excuses,\" the Governor wrote on social media Thursday morning. \"We've provided the time. We've provided the funds. Now it's time for locals to do their job.\"\n\nGov. Newsom, who calls himself the state's \"homeless czar,\" has made the topic a signature policy issue during his term. His administration has spent roughly $24 billion on various programs to address the crisis, including $3.5 billion to convert rundown motels into homeless housing. In a ballot measure earlier this year, which Newsom threw all of his political weight behind, the state was allowed to borrow $6.4 billion to build 4,350 housing units. \"It is time to move with urgency at the local level to clean up these sites,\" Newsom stated in a video posted to social media.\n\nHomeless advocates claim that sweeps are cruel and a waste of taxpayer money, insisting that the solution is rooted in more housing, not in cracking down.\n\nPrioritizing areas that most threaten health and safety, Gov. Newsom called on state and local leaders to \"humanely remove encampments from public spaces,\" such as those camping along waterways. In Santa Maria, most of the individuals experiencing homelessness live in the riverbed, with estimates identifying roughly 120 individuals along the water. Yet only a portion of the riverbed population lies within Santa Barbara County, with the majority lying across the boundary in San Luis Obispo county, making it difficult to provide services.\n\nWhile the governor cannot order local authorities to act, his administration can apply pressure by withholding money for cities and counties across California. Officials, Newsom directed, should give notice to vacate, connect homeless campers to local services, and help store their belongings for at least 60 days.", "source": {"uri": "independent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Santa Barbara Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aidan_kenney@independent.com", "name": "Aidan Kenney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Barbara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santa Maria, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Maria, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Luis Obispo County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Luis Obispo County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-at-2.57.09\u202fPM.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Approximately 181,000 people in the state are estimated to be homeless, making California home to the largest population of unhoused people in the country.\n\nCities and counties across the state have approached the encampment problem from various angles but with mixed results.\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court essentially gave cities the go-ahead to enact ordinances that target homelessness by punishing people for sleeping outside on public property. The conservative majority of the court said that a set of rules that allow law enforcement to ticket, fine or jail people sleeping outside did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nNewsom praised the ruling, saying it would allow officials to \"enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments\" and lifted limitations on \"their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities.\"\n\nBut human rights groups condemned the ruling, saying it was not a proper solution to homelessness.\n\n\"We cannot arrest our way out of homelessness,\" Scout Katovich, an ACLU attorney in the Trone Center for Justice and Equality, said in a statement last month.\n\n\"It is hard to imagine a starker example of excessive punishment than fining and jailing a person for the basic human act of sleeping,\" Katovich added.\n\nAnn Olivia, the CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said the Supreme Court's ruling set a \"dangerous precedent\" and allowed elected officials to \"shift the burden\" of homelessness solutions on law enforcement.\n\nNewsom's executive order cannot force cities to take action but will serve as a

Gavin Newsom (D-CA) will issue an order on Thursday for officials to start dismantling thousands of homeless encampments around California.\n\nIn June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision that cities can begin to ban people from sleeping and camping in public areas. The ruling overturned a lower court decision that called it cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment to punish those sleeping outside if they had nowhere else to go.\n\nNewsom's move is the most sweeping response to date following that decision.\n\nNewsom's executive order will affect thousands of people in his state, which has the highest housing costs and the highest number of homeless people in the country.\n\nLast year, 180,000 people were homeless. About 123,000 Californians were unsheltered on any given night, according to a recent count. Unlike New York City, which guarantees people the right to housing, California does not.\n\n\"Where do people experiencing homelessness go if every community decides to punish them for their homelessness,\" asked Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\nNewsom's order states agencies should adopt policies to prioritize efforts to address encampments by providing notice to vacate at least 48 hours in advance. They should also contact service providers, collect personal property from removal sites, and store it for at least 60 days.\n\nThe Democratic governor's order also notes that state agencies aren't allowed to simply move campers from one location to another but that they should work with local officials to start housing people and provide services that will allow them to leave the streets for good.\n\nCalifornia has spent billions of dollars to curb its homelessness problem, with little success.\n\nThe streets of San Francisco's Tenderloin district are lined with people who are homeless. Some are addicted to drugs and alcohol while others have mental problems. There are also those who simply can't keep up with the high rental rates in an area that caters to Silicon Valley billionaires.\n\nLos Angeles's Skid Row is home to one of the largest populations of homeless people in the United States. More than 4,400 men, women, and children sleep on drug- and disease-infested streets and under dirty tarps where crime, prostitution, and beatings take place in broad daylight. Skid Row started to take shape in the 1930s and has morphed into a modern-day nightmare.\n\nSince taking office in 2019, Newsom has directed $24 billion to California's homelessness problem.

Newsom in Sudden Rush to Scrape Homeless Off CA Streets and From Under Highways", "body": "Something's in the air. And oleaginous Gov having Newsom has caught a whiff of it and likes the smell. It's called \"clean and safe streets.\"\n\nNow, it is a little strange that the Randall Flagg clone has suddenly been moved by some impulse to dive into the homeless problem. It's not like he hasn't made the issue a centerpiece of his campaigns, like, forever and truly been the most successful politician in America at covering his streets with tents, needles, the addicts to go with them, poop, and garbage so deep the rats are grossed out.\n\nPeople are just cynical enough to wonder if it doesn't have to do with the recent SCOTUS decision untying homeless clean-up efforts and annotating a former California AG, senator, and now US VP as the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nNewsom wasn't so hep before Sunday. He spoke not a word about it and the SCOTUS decision's been out for a while. Within two days of Kamala's coronation...the streets must be swept of human refuse?\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Thursday for the removal of homeless encampments in his state.\n\nNewsom's order would direct state agencies on how to remove the thousands of tents and makeshift shelters across the state that line freeways, clutter shopping center parking lots and fill city parks. The order makes clear that the decision to remove the encampments remains in the hands of local authorities.\n\nThe guidance comes after a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this summer allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces. The case was the most significant on the issue to come before the high court in decades and comes as cities across the country have wrestled with the politically complicated issue of how to deal with a rising number of people without a permanent place to live and public frustration over related health and safety issues.\n\n\"We must act with urgency to address dangerous encampments,\" Newsom said in a statement.\n\nThings are definitely shaking in San Francisco. London Breed was already making noises about sweeping homeless camps off city streets, but her motives are pretty obvious - she's in a dogfight to keep her mayor's seat this fall. She's got to do something, even if it runs contrary to her progressive impulses or she's out of a schweet gig.\n\nNow she has SCOTUS cover when the howls start, as does Newsom. Especially when they start talking about \"cutting off the opportunities.\" What? The handouts, etc?\n\nYowsahs.\n\nIn a Mayoral election debate last week, San Francisco Mayor London Breed vowed to combat homelessness in the city soon. Specifically, she noted that she will be targeting homeless encampments beginning in August.\n\n\"The problem is not going to be solved by building permanent supportive housing or shelter alone; we have to start cutting off the opportunities that exist in San Francisco,\" said Breed last Thursday. \"Effective August, we are going to be very aggressive and assertive in moving encampments, which may even include criminal penalties. We have had to move from a compassionate city to a city of accountability. Citations, penalties and criminal penalties. We now have the ability to enforce the law.\"\n\nWhile Breed's action follow years of stop and go actions against the homeless in the city, her announcement on Thursday was in response to two major things. The first was her main opponent in the race: Former Mayor Mark Farrell. Farrell currently holds a slight lead in Mayoral polls, with all polls showing him ahead to some degree in a final Farrell v. Breed decision. Farrell, as well as Levi Strauss heir and fellow candidate David Lurie, have been particularly in favor of removing encampments. Breed, meanwhile, has been more pausing about this issue, saying that the number of encampments has gone down and that camping on the streets is already prohibited. Despite that, Farrell's bullish approach has helped him leap up in the polls, causing Breed to give chase.\n\nThe second are the courts. In a one-two punch in the last month, the Supreme Court ruled in City of Grants Pass v. Johnson that cities could more easily take down homeless encampments, with an Appellate Court order restricting homeless encampment sweeps being thrown out. With San Francisco now having the green light to ramp up their encampment sweeps, Breed waited until the debate last week to announce the new crackdown.\n\nThis is 100% political, trying to spruce up Kamala's CA origin story. The place is a dumpster fire, and her policies as AG helped make it that way, so again, the situation calls for the application of more lipstick.\n\nAs for \"Newsom couldn't do anything until the SCOTUS decision!\" what a load of hooey.\n\nYou could eat off the streets when they held the Asian-Pacific Economic Conference in San Francisco last November, and Xi Jinping got the red carpet treatment.\n\nWell isn't this special?\n\nGavin Newsom and London Breed, Mayor of San Francisco, went to great trouble to clean up the trash (and excrement) on San Francisco's streets, and somehow move along the homeless folks who were doing the trashing.\n\nNewsom admitted they did this to \"impress the neighbors,\" meaning that the residents of San Francisco may not be good enough to live in a clean and safe city, but when foreigners like Xi Jinping come to visit for the APEC summit the city needs to look nice and tidy.\n\nNewsom didn't give two hoots about homeless advocates or homeless rights when he booted the addicts and hosed down all those city blocks to kiss Xi's Winnie Poo asterisk. He doesn't give two hoots now.\n\nIt's all party politics.\n\nAs someone pointed out in comments on X, if Newsom actually wanted to \"solve\" homelessness in any of the 20 years he's been running on it, he'd also deprive himself and his minions of the greatest money laundering operation they have going out there. Billions have been poured into the untraceable black homeless hole.\n\nWho'd want to \"solve\" that? Certainly not the NGO's and CA state agencies who get paid so handsomely to look for solution and provide assistance to the ever burgeoning population of \"needy.\"\n\nI hope Harris appreciates what Gavin's pretending to do for her if she survives the trials ahead intact and makes it to the DNC as the presumptive nominee.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"},

It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nThe Democratic governor issued an executive order to direct state agencies \"to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them.\"\n\nDespite the governor's order, local jurisdictions are not required to follow suit, leading to a debate among the state's Democrats, who remain divided on the issue.\n\nLike Newsom, San Francisco Mayor London Breed shares a tough approach to homelessness, saying last week the northern California city is \"going to be very aggressive and assertive in moving encampments\" beginning in August.\n\nThe head of the famously liberal city has long complained about the legal protections granted to homeless residents given prior court rulings which prevented municipalities from regulating people who camped or lived outdoors.\n\nMore from this section Head of Myanmar Junta Assumes Presidential Powers as Civil War Drags On - TaiwanPlus News Trump Finally Reveals What Biden Told Him After Assassination Attempt: 'You're Lucky To...' | US News Olympics chance for USA to 'come together', says flagbearer Gauff\n\nThe US Supreme Court took up the issue from a lawsuit filed by the small town of Grants Pass, in neighboring state Oregon, which had passed two \"anti-camping\" ordinances to ban homeless residents from sleeping outdoors.\n\nWhile a US District Court had ruled in 2022 that the ordinances went against the US Constitution's prohibition of \"cruel and unusual punishment,\" the conservative-majority Supreme Court overturned the decision in late June.\n\nThe ruling was celebrated by Republicans who frequently criticize Democrats for being too lax on homelessness.\n\nUnlike her northern California counterpart, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass denounced the Supreme Court's ruling, saying it allowed \"the criminalization of people for sleeping outside when they have no other safe place to go.\"\n\nBass's homelessness policy for Los Angeles, which has the highest number of homeless residents in California, has been to increase efforts to place people in shelters.\n\nHer efforts have paid off, resulting in a 10.4 percent decrease this year in the number of residents sleeping outside.\n\nrfo/jgc/mlm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Newsom Issues Executive Order to Remove Homeless Encampments - MyNewsLA.com", "body": "Southland elected officials were weighing in Thursday on California Gov. Gavin Newsom's decision to issue an executive order for the removal of homeless encampments in the state while adding that local authorities will decide on the removals.\n\nThe guidance follows a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this summer allowing cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses.\"\n\nNewsom's order directs state agencies to move urgently to address encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them. It also provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same.\n\n\"We must act with urgency to address dangerous encampments,\" Newsom said.\n\nThe governor added that homeless people are subjected to living in \"extreme weather, fires, predatory and criminal activity, and widespread substance use.\"\n\nWhile Newsom lacks the authority to mandate action, he can influence local decisions through the allocation of billions in state funds for homelessness initiatives.\n\n\"I applaud Governor Newsom's emphasis on urgency,\" Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said in a statement.\n\n\"He rightfully points out that local government remains at the helm of homeless encampment removals. Cities have an obligation to develop housing and shelter solutions in tandem with support services provided by county government. This formula, which is largely based on partnerships, is how we can deliver permanent results. No single entity can achieve that.\"\n\nLindsey Horvath, chair of the county Board of Supervisors and the L.A. Homeless Services Authority Commission, also commended the governor's decision.\n\n\"Los Angeles County's Pathway Home Program is doing exactly what this state order calls for -- urgent and humane encampment resolution,\" Horvath said in a statement. \"Los Angeles County is -- and has been -- all in on doing our part under our homelessness emergency.\"\n\nHorvath added that she looks forward to next week's Board of Supervisors meeting, which will discuss how the county will continue to \"coordinate and scale a regional response that delivers lasting results.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's 6-3 decision on June 28 reversed a ruling by a San Francisco appeals court that found outdoor sleeping bans amount to cruel and unusual punishment when there is no available shelter space for the homeless. The ruling of the Supreme Court's majority found the 8th Amendment does not apply to outdoor sleeping bans.\n\nThe case originated in the rural Oregon town of Grants Pass, which appealed a ruling striking down local ordinances that fined people $295 for sleeping outside after tents began crowding public parks. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over nine Western states, ruled in 2018 that such bans violate the 8th Amendment of those who are in areas where there are not enough shelter beds.\n\n\"This ruling must not be used as an excuse for cities across the country to attempt to arrest their way out of this problem or hide the homelessness crisis in neighboring cities or in jail,\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said following the Supreme Court's decision. \"Neither will work, neither will save lives and that route is more expensive for taxpayers than actually solving the problem.\"\n\nLast month, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) announced the total number of people experiencing homelessness in the Los Angeles region had dropped slightly in 2024, reversing a five-year upward trend -- though the numbers remain significant.\n\nSpecifically, there were 75,312 unhoused people in Los Angeles County in 2024 compared to 75,518 in 2023, a dip of 0.27%; and there were 45,252 unhoused individuals in the city of L.A. in 2024 compared to 46,260 in 2023, a drop of 2.2%.\n\nThose numbers were gathered during an annual point-in-time survey conducted by hundreds of volunteers all across the region from Jan. 24-26.", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Newsom asked that the policies be consistent with those adopted by the California Department of Transportation.\n\nThe Department of Transportation has cleared more than 11,000 encampments over the last three years from underneath overpasses, near offramps and more.\n\nThe state will give those people 48 to 72 hours notice and connect them with local service providers and housing. Any personal property will be collected, bagged, tagged and stored for at least 60 days.\n\n\"No more excuses. We've provided the time. We've provided the funds. Now it's time for locals to do their job,\" Newsom wrote on X in response to the order.\n\nIt is the governor's first sweeping effort to tackle California's homelessness problem - something he has made a priority of his governorship.\n\nApproximately 181,000 people in the state are estimated to be homeless, making California home to the largest population of unhoused people in the country.\n\nCities and counties across the state have approached the problem from various angles but with mixed results.\n\nIn Los Angeles, thousands of unhoused people have obtained temporary housing as part of the mayor's initiative but the short-term fix has also led to segregation, police harassment and property destruction.\n\nBut last month the Supreme Court essentially gave cities the go-ahead to enact ordinances that target homelessness by punishing people for sleeping outside on public property.\n\nThe conservative majority of the court said that a set of rules that allow law enforcement to ticket, fine or jail people sleeping outside did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nNewsom praised the ruling, saying it would allow officials to \"enforce policies to clear unsafe encampments\" and lifted limitations on \"their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities.\"\n\nBut human rights groups condemned the ruling, saying it was not a proper solution to homelessness.\n\n\"We cannot arrest our way out of homelessness,\" Scout Katovich, an ACLU attorney in the Trone Center for Justice and Equality, said in a statement last month.\n\n\"It is hard to imagine a starker example of excessive punishment than fining and jailing a person for the basic human act of sleeping,\" Katovich added.\n\nAnn Olivia, the CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness said the Supreme Court's ruling set a \"dangerous precedent\" and allowed elected officials to \"shift the burden\" of homelessness solutions on law enforcement.\n\nNewsom's executive order cannot force cities to take action but will serve as a guideline when officials are faced with a homeless encampment that they believe is a health or safety risk.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness",

The Governor has also pioneered nation-leading homeless and housing reforms and invested more than $24 billion to address this crisis with state and local support, including $4.85 billion for Homeless, Housing Assistance and Prevention Grants for local jurisdictions to prevent and reduce homelessness, $1 billion in Encampment Resolution Funding to assist local jurisdictions in providing services and supports to people living in encampments, and $3.3 billion for Homekey to rapidly expand housing for persons experiencing homelessness.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-of-way_(transportation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-of-way (transportation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_use_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance use disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

There are no longer any excuses,\" Newsom stated in a video posted on X, revealing the new order. California had 180,000 homeless individuals in 2023, more than any other U.S. state, with most sleeping outdoors, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision on June 28 reversed a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that deemed punishing people for sleeping outdoors unconstitutional when no shelter beds are available. As a result, some agencies and local governments hesitated to remove the encampments, fearing legal challenges, while others faced lawsuits after dismantling camps.\n\nGovernor Newsom directed state agencies to prioritize the removal of camps posing health and safety hazards. Agencies are required to provide at least 48 hours' notice to those affected, request social services for them, and store their belongings for at least 60 days. Since July 2021, California's transportation department has eliminated over 11,000 camps under similar policies.\n\nHowever, Divya Shiv of Housing California criticized Newsom's move, arguing that affordable housing is the real solution. Citing a Rand study, she noted that cleanups in Los Angeles didn't reduce homelessness long-term as people returned after a month or two. \"The question remains, where do they go if there isn't enough affordable and supportive housing?\" Shiv challenged.\n\nNewsom's administration reported moving 165,000 homeless individuals into temporary or permanent housing in fiscal year 2022-2023.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Housing and Urban Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supportive_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supportive housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/08_10_2023_01_53_42_1716046.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 677, "textEnd": 684}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom orders homeless camps dismantled", "body": "\"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nCalifornia has some of the highest concentrations of homeless in the country and despite millions of dollars of investment, encampments continue to line sidewalks, beaches and under freeways. A federal report noted the state accounts for nearly half of the country's unsheltered population.\n\nWhile Mr Newsom's order does not require local officials to remove the encampments that are seen throughout urban parts of the state, his administration can threaten to withhold state funds from counties or cities that do not take action aligning with state policy.\n\nCritics and homeless advocates argue that criminalising homelessness does not solve the root issues, and further stigmatises people in need. Dismantling encampments means people can lose all of their possessions, including important legal documents, medications and other necessary items.\n\nSan Francisco, California's fourth most populous city, had previously cheered the Supreme Court decision in the case Grants Pass v Johnson, and has recently said it has already begun to remove tents.\n\nThe governor's order comes as Republicans criticise Democrats for homeless problems that are affecting many American cities, many of which are run by Democratic local governments.\n\nKamala Harris, a native of California's Bay Area who served as San Francisco district attorney before becoming a senator and then vice-president, has recently launched her bid to be the Democratic nominee to run against Republican Donald Trump for president in November's election. Republicans are keen to tie her political record to urban issues, including homelessness, crime and drug use.\n\nMr Newsom, who is also a Democrat, is widely believed to have ambitions for higher office, including the presidency.\n\nCalifornia, with its high cost of housing, had an estimated 180,000 people in 2023 living without permanent shelter, according to an annual report from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nHomelessness is on the rise in the US, fuelled in part by chronic shortages of affordable housing.

Gavin Newsom's order to state agencies to adopt policies to evict homeless encampments came a month after the Supreme Court gave California and other states the green light to ban camping on public property.\n\nThe Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, ruled on ideological lines last month that civil and criminal penalties for camping in public areas are not cruel and unusual punishments on homeless people under the Eighth Amendment.\n\nThe 6-3 decision in City of Grants Pass v. Johnson removed blockages from lower court rulings on anti-camping laws in Western states, including California. By siding with the Oregon mountain town of Grants Pass, the Supreme Court allowed state and local officials to enforce laws clearing homeless encampments.\n\nGrants Pass v. Johnson asked whether fining and arresting unhoused people for camping in public areas -- from a parked car to a tent at the park or a blanket on the sidewalk -- when they have nowhere else to go violated the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The amendment prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishments.\"\n\nWhat was Grants Pass v. Johnson?\n\nThe case originated from Grants Pass, a southwest Oregon town of about 40,000 people. About a decade ago, its city council instituted fines that could lead to criminal charges for unhoused people sleeping outside, even those using as little as a blanket or cardboard box when they lacked other shelter, in an effort to ban encampments.\n\nGrants Pass has one overnight shelter for adults with 138 beds. But the shelter has a Christian focus and strict restrictions that made it unpalatable or inaccessible to many of the approximately 600 people who were experiencing homelessness in the city.\n\nIn 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Western states, decided in Martin v. City of Boise that the Eighth Amendment prohibited local governments from criminalizing \"sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain shelter.\"\n\nThe appellate court relied on a 1962 Supreme Court decision that said the Eighth Amendment prevented criminalizing someone's status -- in Martin v. Boise, the status of homelessness. The 1962 case, Robinson v. California, involved the status of being addicted to drugs.\n\nFollowing the decision in Martin v. Boise, lawyers representing homeless residents sued Grants Pass over the anti-camping ordinances. In 2020, a federal judge in Oregon ruled that due to the lack of shelter, fining and arresting homeless people for sleeping outside with makeshift bedding violated the Eighth Amendment.\n\nIn 2022, the Ninth Circuit agreed. Civil fines that were intertwined with criminal punishments, like the ones in Grants Pass, were blocked there and in Western states, including California.\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned both Ninth Circuit rulings in its decision last month.\n\nHow did the Ninth Circuit rulings affect California?\n\nBefore the Supreme Court decision, some lower court judges citing the Ninth Circuit rulings blocked municipalities from evicting encampments unless there were enough shelter beds for its entire homeless population.\n\nCalifornia officials said the Ninth Circuit decisions were confusing and did not properly distinguish what is voluntary versus involuntary homelessness.\n\nLawmakers from across the state and political spectrum had a strong interest in Grants Pass v. Johnson as California grapples with some of the highest rates of homelessness and housing costs in the United States.\n\nNewsom and others had urged the Supreme Court to hear the case, arguing in legal briefs that lower court rulings had stymied their ability to regulate encampments even when shelter beds were available.\n\nOn Thursday, Newsom directed agencies to remove homeless encampments that pose a risk to \"life, health and safety.\"\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets. There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nHousing advocates warned that penalizing people for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go would perpetuate poverty and worsen homelessness.\n\n\"This is going to be a harmful policy for everyone,\" Eric Tars, policy director at the National Homelessness Law Center, which opposed the court's ruling, said of Newsom's order. \"But there are some people who are going to hurt more, and those are already people already marginalized on racial, gender lines and disabled communities.\"", "source": {"uri": "mcclatchydc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "McClatchy Washington Bureau"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gillian_brassil@mcclatchydc.com", "name": "Gillian Brassil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_v._Boise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin v.

Gavin Newsom for what they say is a \"PR stunt,\" after he announced a new initiative to dismantle homeless encampments across the state via an executive order. The Republicans ripped Newsom in a press release after he announced the initiative on Thursday, with his office stating that the governor has ordered \"state agencies and departments to adopt clear policies that urgently address homeless encampments while respecting the dignity and well-being of all Californians.\"\n\n\"It's about damn time! Letting people live and die on the streets or in our parks is unsafe and unsanitary,\" said Senate Minority Leader Brian W. Jones (R-San Diego). \"I introduced a proposal earlier this year that would have provided even greater and more immediate solutions.

Johnson last month, which found laws restricting sleeping in public areas did not violate the constitutional restriction against \"cruel and unusual punishment.\"\n\nMASSIVE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL TOWER TO OFFER HOMELESS PRIVATE ROOMS, GYM, CAFE AND MORE AMENITIES\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said. \"There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nThe order is expected to affect tens of thousands of homeless Californians who have set up long-term encampments and occupied entire city blocks with open-air drug use.\n\n\"Big promises. No action. Blame locals. No press.

ON HOMELESS CRISIS\n\nBack in April, California GOP leaders called for more accountability after an audit indicated that the state spent around $24 billion to tackle the homeless crisis over the past five years but did not consistently track whether the huge outlay of public money did anything to actually improve the problem.\n\nThe state auditor's report found that despite roughly $24 billion spent on homeless and housing programs during the 2018-2023 fiscal years, the problem didn't improve in many cities, according to the state auditor's report.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS

Gavin Newsom for his executive order to remove homeless encampments across the Golden State.\n\n\"I'm glad to see Governor Newsom finally accept reality and acknowledge the damage chronic homelessness does to communities and businesses,\" said state Rep. Sam Garrison, R-Fleming Island, in a statement.\n\nGarrison, who is in line to be Florida House speaker in 2026-28, thanked Gov. Ron DeSantis for signing \"Unauthorized Public Camping and Public Sleeping\" (HB 1365), which prohibits local municipalities from allowing people to camp or sleep on public property.\n\n\"The Free State of Florida rejects the siren song of comfortable inaction and instead chooses to lead the way,\" Garrison added.\n\nThe order requires state departments and agencies in California to address encampments on state property. Notices to vacate must be posted at least 48 hours in advance, and personal property will be bagged, tagged and stored for at least 60 days, according to the executive order.\n\n\"No more excuses. We've provided the time. We've provided the funds. Now it's time for locals to do their job,\" Newsom wrote in a post on X.\n\nCalifornia's move to ban homeless encampments comes after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in late June it's not \"cruel and unusual\" to fine and jail people for being camping and living in public spaces.\n\nDeSantis spokesman Bryan Griffin urged California to make the executive order a state law. \"Keep following the Florida model,\" he posted on X.\n\nChristina Pushaw, the special projects director for DeSantis' communications team, wrote in a social post that she was doubtful Newsom could enforce his executive order.\n\n\"I do hope California is able to clean up the homeless encampments because they're squalid, dangerous, and should not exist in a civilized society. However, as with anything Newsom says, I'll believe it when I see it,\" she wrote.\n\nAs previously reported, the deadline to comply with Florida's new anti-camping law is drawing near, and local municipalities are scrambling to comply.\n\nIn March, the City of Orlando was looking at facilities for an emergency overnight shelter, said spokesperson Ashley Papagni.\n\nAnd the Tampa Bay Times recently reported Pinellas County law enforcement agencies have started to track the location and number of homeless people who sleep outside.\n\nDeSantis has touted the state's anti-camping law as the \"Florida Model,\" a way to keep the state from looking like San Francisco, a city that he had previously said \"collapsed because of leftist policies.\"\n\nDeSantis and Newsom have a fierce rivalry, even debating each other last year on Fox News. Newsom has criticized DeSantis over abortion and immigration, and DeSantis has consistently used California as an example of what Florida isn't.\n\n\"We're basically saying in the state of Florida, a municipality or county is just simply not allowed to embrace San Francisco-style policies,\" DeSantis said in March. \"You can make other choices, but you can't make that choice. Why? Because every time that choice has been made, the result has been destructive.\"\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) counted 18,815 year-round shelter beds in emergency, safe haven and transitional housing in Florida. That same year, the state had 30,756 people experiencing homelessness, with 15,482 people unsheltered.\n\nIn 2023, the Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to Congress by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development found Hardee, Hendry and Highlands counties had the second-highest rate of homelessness in the nation.", "source": {"uri": "tallahassee.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Gavin Newsom directed state agencies on Thursday to dismantle homeless encampments on state land after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for states and cities to move more aggressively.\n\nNewsom's order tells state agencies to identify sites where unhoused people have pitched tents and to make plans to relocate them. The Democratic governor is taking advantage of a high court ruling that overturned a ban on moving people off of public property unless there are sufficient shelter beds for them.\n\n\"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"There are simply no more excuses.\"\n\nHomelessness has become a paramount issue in California and a political liability for Newsom and other Democrats as voter frustration has grown. Tents have proliferated around sidewalks, parks, and highway underpasses as the number of unhoused people trudges ever upwards.\n\nThe Newsom administration has poured billions of dollars into addressing the issue, but the governor has argued that he was hamstrung by court decisions limiting local governments from acting. He implored the Supreme Court to loosen those restrictions, aligning himself with Republicans and a conservative high court majority that he often opposes.\n\nThursday's executive order expands on Newsom's work more broadly to move people off the street. The California Highway Patrol has acted on thousands of sites in recent years -- figures Newsom has touted as signs of progress -- and the governor has clashed with local governments that he's accused of dragging their feet, threatening to withhold funds.\n\nUnder the order, all state agencies must inventory encampments and formulate plans to begin addressing them. They will need to work with local service providers but, thanks to the Supreme Court decision, they do not need to ensure there are enough shelter beds for everyone before removing an encampment.\n\nOfficials across California are moving swiftly to ramp up encampment clearances.

The ruling overturned a lower court decision that called it cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment to punish those sleeping outside if they had nowhere else to go.\n\nNewsom's move is the most sweeping response to date following that decision.\n\nNewsom's executive order will affect thousands of people in his state, which has the highest housing costs and the highest number of homeless people in the country.\n\nLast year, 180,000 people were homeless. About 123,000 Californians were unsheltered on any given night, according to a recent count. Unlike New York City, which guarantees people the right to housing, California does not.\n\n\"Where do people experiencing homelessness go if every community decides to punish them for their homelessness,\" asked Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\nNewsom's order states agencies should adopt policies to prioritize efforts to address encampments by providing notice to vacate at least 48 hours in advance. They should also contact service providers, collect personal property from removal sites, and store it for at least 60 days.\n\nThe Democratic governor's order also notes that state agencies aren't allowed to simply move campers from one location to another but that they should work with local officials to start housing people and provide services that will allow them to leave the streets for good.\n\nCalifornia has spent billions of dollars to curb its homelessness problem, with little success.\n\nThe streets of San Francisco's Tenderloin district are lined with people who are homeless. Some are addicted to drugs and alcohol while others have mental problems. There are also those who simply can't keep up with the high rental rates in an area that caters to Silicon Valley billionaires.\n\nLos Angeles's Skid Row is home to one of the largest populations of homeless people in the United States. More than 4,400 men, women, and children sleep on drug- and disease-infested streets and under dirty tarps where crime, prostitution, and beatings take place in broad daylight. Skid Row started to take shape in the 1930s and has morphed into a modern-day nightmare.\n\nSince taking office in 2019, Newsom has directed $24 billion to California's homelessness problem. His administration said it moved more than 165,000 people into temporary or permanent housing two years ago but that there is more to be done.\n\n\"There are simply no more excuses,\" he said. \"It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nLast week, San Francisco Mayor London Breed, a Democrat who is facing a tough reelection in November, said city officials would become \"very aggressive and assertive in moving encampments\" starting in August.\n\n\"My hope is that we can clear them all,\" she said at a news conference, adding that homeless people who refuse service have only added to the city's economic decline, which includes businesses abandoning the downtown area and tourists staying away.\n\nAbout 62 miles north of Los Angeles in Lancaster, Republican Mayor R. Rex Parris put it bluntly.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I'm warming up the bulldozer,\" he told the New York Times. \"I want the tents away from the residential areas and the shopping centers and the freeways.\"\n\n\"I get that some of these people have fallen on hard times and we have a state-of-the-art shelter with beds available.

Gavin Newsom's banning of homeless camps", "body": "GOP Rep. Sam Garrison, in line to be the next Fla. House speaker, said he was glad Newsom acknowledged 'the damage chronic homelessness does to communities and businesses.'\n\nTop Florida Republicans, including a leading lawmaker and governor's office staff, are applauding Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom for his executive order to remove homeless encampments across the Golden State.\n\n\"I'm glad to see Governor Newsom finally accept reality and acknowledge the damage chronic homelessness does to communities and businesses,\" said state Rep. Sam Garrison, R-Fleming Island, in a statement.\n\nGarrison, who is in line to be Florida House speaker in 2026-28, thanked Gov. Ron DeSantis for signing \"Unauthorized Public Camping and Public Sleeping\" (HB 1365), which prohibits local municipalities from allowing people to camp or sleep on public property.\n\n\"The Free State of Florida rejects the siren song of comfortable inaction and instead chooses to lead the way,\" Garrison added.\n\nThe order requires state departments and agencies in California to address encampments on state property. Notices to vacate must be posted at least 48 hours in advance, and personal property will be bagged, tagged and stored for at least 60 days, according to the executive order.\n\n\"No more excuses. We've provided the time. We've provided the funds. Now it's time for locals to do their job,\" Newsom wrote in a post on X.\n\nCalifornia's move to ban homeless encampments comes after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in late June it's not \"cruel and unusual\" to fine and jail people for being camping and living in public spaces.\n\nDeSantis spokesman Bryan Griffin urged California to make the executive order a state law. \"Keep following the Florida model,\" he posted on X.\n\nChristina Pushaw, the special projects director for DeSantis' communications team, wrote in a social post that she was doubtful Newsom could enforce his executive order.\n\n\"I do hope California is able to clean up the homeless encampments because they're squalid, dangerous, and should not exist in a civilized society. However, as with anything Newsom says, I'll believe it when I see it,\" she wrote.\n\nAs previously reported, the deadline to comply with Florida's new anti-camping law is drawing near, and local municipalities are scrambling to comply.\n\nIn March, the City of Orlando was looking at facilities for an emergency overnight shelter, said spokesperson Ashley Papagni.\n\nAnd the Tampa Bay Times recently reported Pinellas County law enforcement agencies have started to track the location and number of homeless people who sleep outside.\n\nDeSantis has touted the state's anti-camping law as the \"Florida Model,\" a way to keep the state from looking like San Francisco, a city that he had previously said \"collapsed because of leftist policies.\"\n\nDeSantis and Newsom have a fierce rivalry, even debating each other last year on Fox News. Newsom has criticized DeSantis over abortion and immigration, and DeSantis has consistently used California as an example of what Florida isn't.\n\n\"We're basically saying in the state of Florida, a municipality or county is just simply not allowed to embrace San Francisco-style policies,\" DeSantis said in March. \"You can make other choices, but you can't make that choice. Why? Because every time that choice has been made, the result has been destructive.\"\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) counted 18,815 year-round shelter beds in emergency, safe haven and transitional housing in Florida. That same year, the state had 30,756 people experiencing homelessness, with 15,482 people unsheltered.\n\nIn 2023, the Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to Congress by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development found Hardee, Hendry and Highlands counties had the second-highest rate of homelessness in the nation.", "source": {"uri": "tcpalm.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Now, the state is making an additional $299 million available to locals to build on the state's progress and assist an estimated 10,000 individuals experiencing homelessness.

Johnson removed blockages from lower court rulings on anti-camping laws in Western states, including California. By siding with the Oregon mountain town of Grants Pass, the Supreme Court allowed state and local officials to enforce laws clearing homeless encampments.\n\nGrants Pass v. Johnson asked whether fining and arresting unhoused people for camping in public areas -- from a parked car to a tent at the park or a blanket on the sidewalk -- when they have nowhere else to go violated the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The amendment prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishments.\"\n\nWhat was Grants Pass v. Johnson?\n\nThe case originated from Grants Pass, a southwest Oregon town of about 40,000 people. About a decade ago, its city council instituted fines that could lead to criminal charges for unhoused people sleeping outside, even those using as little as a blanket or cardboard box when they lacked other shelter, in an effort to ban encampments.\n\nGrants Pass has one overnight shelter for adults with 138 beds. But the shelter has a Christian focus and strict restrictions that made it unpalatable or inaccessible to many of the approximately 600 people who were experiencing homelessness in the city.\n\nIn 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Western states, decided in Martin v. City of Boise that the Eighth Amendment prohibited local governments from criminalizing \"sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain shelter.\"\n\nThe appellate court relied on a 1962 Supreme Court decision that said the Eighth Amendment prevented criminalizing someone's status -- in Martin v. Boise, the status of homelessness. The 1962 case, Robinson v. California, involved the status of being addicted to drugs.\n\nFollowing the decision in Martin v. Boise, lawyers representing homeless residents sued Grants Pass over the anti-camping ordinances. In 2020, a federal judge in Oregon ruled that due to the lack of shelter, fining and arresting homeless people for sleeping outside with makeshift bedding violated the Eighth Amendment.\n\nIn 2022, the Ninth Circuit agreed. Civil fines that were intertwined with criminal punishments, like the ones in Grants Pass, were blocked there and in Western states, including California.\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned both Ninth Circuit rulings in its decision last month.\n\nHow did the Ninth Circuit rulings affect California?\n\nBefore the Supreme Court decision, some lower court judges citing the Ninth Circuit rulings blocked municipalities from evicting encampments unless there were enough shelter beds for its entire homeless population.\n\nCalifornia officials said the Ninth Circuit decisions were confusing and did not properly distinguish what is voluntary versus involuntary homelessness.\n\nLawmakers from across the state and political spectrum had a strong interest in Grants Pass v. Johnson as California grapples with some of the highest rates of homelessness and housing costs in the United States.\n\nNewsom and others had urged the Supreme Court to hear the case, arguing in legal briefs that lower court rulings had stymied their ability to regulate encampments even when shelter beds were available.\n\nOn Thursday, Newsom directed agencies to remove homeless encampments that pose a risk to \"life, health and safety.\"\n\n\"This executive order directs state agencies to move urgently to address dangerous encampments while supporting and assisting the individuals living in them -- and provides guidance for cities and counties to do the same,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"The state has been hard at work to address this crisis on our streets. There are simply no more excuses. It's time for everyone to do their part.\"\n\nHousing advocates warned that penalizing people for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go would perpetuate poverty and worsen homelessness.\n\n\"This is going to be a harmful policy for everyone,\" Eric Tars, policy director at the National Homelessness Law Center, which opposed the court's ruling, said of Newsom's order. \"But there are some people who are going to hurt more, and those are already people already marginalized on racial, gender lines and disabled communities.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gillian_brassil@yahoo.com", "name": "Gillian Brassil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_v._Boise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin v.

Gavin Newsom's banning of homeless camps", "body": "Top Florida Republicans, including a leading lawmaker and governor's office staff, are applauding Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom for his executive order to remove homeless encampments across the Golden State.\n\n\"I'm glad to see Governor Newsom finally accept reality and acknowledge the damage chronic homelessness does to communities and businesses,\" said state Rep. Sam Garrison, R-Fleming Island, in a statement.\n\nGarrison, who is in line to be Florida House speaker in 2026-28, thanked Gov. Ron DeSantis for signing \"Unauthorized Public Camping and Public Sleeping\" (HB 1365), which prohibits local municipalities from allowing people to camp or sleep on public property.\n\n\"The Free State of Florida rejects the siren song of comfortable inaction and instead chooses to lead the way,\" Garrison added.\n\nThe order requires state departments and agencies in California to address encampments on state property. Notices to vacate must be posted at least 48 hours in advance, and personal property will be bagged, tagged and stored for at least 60 days, according to the executive order.\n\n\"No more excuses. We've provided the time. We've provided the funds. Now it's time for locals to do their job,\" Newsom wrote in a post on X.\n\nCalifornia's move to ban homeless encampments comes after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in late June it's not \"cruel and unusual\" to fine and jail people for being camping and living in public spaces.\n\nDeSantis spokesman Bryan Griffin urged California to make the executive order a state law. \"Keep following the Florida model,\" he posted on X.\n\nChristina Pushaw, the special projects director for DeSantis' communications team, wrote in a social post that she was doubtful Newsom could enforce his executive order.\n\n\"I do hope California is able to clean up the homeless encampments because they're squalid, dangerous, and should not exist in a civilized society. However, as with anything Newsom says, I'll believe it when I see it,\" she wrote.\n\nAs previously reported, the deadline to comply with Florida's new anti-camping law is drawing near, and local municipalities are scrambling to comply.\n\nIn March, the City of Orlando was looking at facilities for an emergency overnight shelter, said spokesperson Ashley Papagni.\n\nAnd the Tampa Bay Times recently reported Pinellas County law enforcement agencies have started to track the location and number of homeless people who sleep outside.\n\nDeSantis has touted the state's anti-camping law as the \"Florida Model,\" a way to keep the state from looking like San Francisco, a city that he had previously said \"collapsed because of leftist policies.\"\n\nDeSantis and Newsom have a fierce rivalry, even debating each other last year on Fox News. Newsom has criticized DeSantis over abortion and immigration, and DeSantis has consistently used California as an example of what Florida isn't.\n\n\"We're basically saying in the state of Florida, a municipality or county is just simply not allowed to embrace San Francisco-style policies,\" DeSantis said in March. \"You can make other choices, but you can't make that choice. Why? Because every time that choice has been made, the result has been destructive.\"\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) counted 18,815 year-round shelter beds in emergency, safe haven and transitional housing in Florida. That same year, the state had 30,756 people experiencing homelessness, with 15,482 people unsheltered.\n\nIn 2023, the Annual Homelessness Assessment Report to Congress by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development found Hardee, Hendry and Highlands counties had the second-highest rate of homelessness in the nation.\n\nAna Go\u00f1i-Lessan, state watchdog reporter for the USA TODAY

Its causes are many,\" Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, author of the majority opinion, wrote in the ruling. \"People will disagree over which policy responses are best ... nor can a handful of federal judges begin to 'match' the collective wisdom the American people possess in deciding 'how best to handle' a pressing social question like homelessness.\"\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that sleeping outside is the only option for some people.\n\n\"Sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime,\" she wrote.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said the ruling gives state and local officials the authority to enforce policies that will benefit Californians.\n\n\"This decision removes the legal ambiguities that have tied the hands of local officials for years and limited their ability to deliver on common-sense measures to protect the safety and well-being of our communities,\" he said in a June 28 press release.\n\nHe also said the state will continue to treat all individuals with compassion.\n\n\"California remains committed to respecting the dignity and fundamental human needs of all people and the state will continue

Its causes are many,\" Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, author of the majority opinion, wrote in the ruling. \"People will disagree over which policy responses are best ... nor can a handful of federal judges begin to 'match' the collective wisdom the American people possess in deciding 'how best to handle' a pressing social question like homelessness.\"\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that sleeping outside is the only option for some people.\n\n\"Sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime,\" she wrote.\n\nGov.

Tents have proliferated around sidewalks, parks, and highway underpasses as the number of unhoused people trudges ever upwards.\n\nThe Newsom administration has poured billions of dollars into addressing the issue, but the governor has argued that he was hamstrung by court decisions limiting local governments from acting. He implored the Supreme Court to loosen those restrictions, aligning himself with Republicans and a conservative high court majority that he often opposes.\n\nThursday's executive order expands on Newsom's work more broadly to move people off the street. The California Highway Patrol has acted on thousands of sites in recent years -- figures Newsom has touted as signs of progress -- and the governor has clashed with local governments that he's accused of dragging their feet, threatening to withhold funds.\n\nUnder the order, all state agencies must inventory encampments and formulate plans to begin addressing them. They will need to work with local service providers but, thanks to the Supreme Court decision, they do not need to ensure there are enough shelter beds for everyone before removing an encampment.\n\nOfficials across California are moving swiftly to ramp up encampment clearances. San Francisco Mayor London Breed has promised a \"very aggressive\" sweep and Oakland has begun to move people.

New Bedford is considering building one. - The Boston Globe", "body": "The 65-year-old New Bedford native said she doesn't want to live this way but cannot afford an apartment amid surging rents. And as she struggles, she believes city leaders need to do more to help residents like her.\n\n\"They seem to think we don't have a homelessness problem,\" Cordeiro said. \"Well, yeah, you do.\"\n\nSome local advocates agree. They point to the scores of people living in a few dozen camps set up under bridges, in abandoned buildings, and in woodlands. So as cities across the country, empowered by a recent Supreme Court decision, move to tear down homeless encampments, the advocates have proposed that New Bedford do the opposite: build one of its own.\n\n\"We need to be proactive,\" said Carl Alves, who leads a coalition of local nonprofits that support homeless residents. \"I'm seeing significant increases in the number of people [who] don't have places to call home or a place to stay.\"\n\nThe debate in New Bedford comes as the nation faces a homelessness crisis. More than 650,000 people were homeless on a single night in 2023, the highest number since 2007, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. That same survey recorded about 19,000 people in Massachusetts who were homeless.\n\nIn June, the Supreme Court ruled that cities have the power to enforce bans on encampments. Even before the ruling, some Massachusetts communities had already dismantled camps, including Boston and Salem. In California, Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday ordered the dismantling of homeless encampments, in a state long known for its large homeless population.\n\nIn New Bedford, where about a fifth of residents live below the poverty line and where some people have stayed in shelters for up to a year, the city-run encampment is envisioned as a place where homeless people could live safely.\n\nThe effort is backed by the nonprofit coalition led by Alves. They presented their plan to the City Council's Affordable Housing and Homeless Affairs Committee last month, calling for the city to provide residents with food, clean water, medical care, bathrooms, and the stability needed to work more closely with local social service agencies.\n\nThe camp proposal, which remains in its very early stages, would likely begin with tents but proponents want to explore converting unused buildings, such as old schools or churches, into shelters, according to Alves.\n\nThe proposal would need to be approved by the City Council and Mayor Jon Mitchell, Alves said. Families with children and unattended minors would not live at the camp, Alves said.\n\n\"We can't wait around to do nothing,\" said the Rev. David A. Lima, executive minister with the Inter-Church council of Greater New Bedford and another proponent of the plan. \"These people have value in God's eyes.\"\n\nThe idea has been met with skepticism from Mitchell, who last year rolled out a plan to create more affordable housing in this historic port city of 101,000, including apartments for residents with low incomes, and launched a comprehensive study intended to help guide a regional response to addressing homelessness. The results from that study are due by the end of summer.\n\n\"The recent record of cities that have sanctioned encampments is that they tend to make it more difficult for those they are intended to serve to emerge successfully from homelessness,\" said the mayor's spokesperson, Jonathan Darling. \"In practice, they have been arguably inhumane.\"\n\nProponents caution a city-authorized encampment would not resolve the homelessness issues alone. More shelter beds and funding for additional support services are needed, but those steps will take time. And speed is of the essence to meet the immediate crisis, they said.\n\n\"We're at a loss here because we don't know what else to do,\" said Shane Burgo, a councilor at large who serves as chair of the homeless affairs committee and supports the proposed camp.\n\nOpponents of encampments argue that they can be unsafe and put residents at a higher risk of violence. In some communities, such as Salem, residents complained about trash and unsightly conditions.\n\nBalakrishnan Rajagopal, an MIT professor who serves as the United Nations' special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, said opening a camp would put people living there at risk from threats such as illness and violence.\n\nHe said that's what happened at San Diego's \"safe sleeping\" sites for homeless residents, where local media reported four people had died since the city opened the first of two encampment sites in June 2023, including one man who overdosed.\n\nHomelessness poses challenges that are beyond the ability of cities such as New Bedford to handle on their own, he said, requiring interventions from the state and federal government to provide more funding for programs including housing vouchers.\n\n\"You cannot solve structural problems by coming up with Band-Aid solutions. . . . And unfortunately, it's a Band-Aid that doesn't even work properly and doesn't cover the wound,\" Rajagopal said.\n\nJoyce Tavon, chief executive of the Massachusetts Housing & Shelter Alliance, agreed that an encampment could put residents at risk, including making mental health and addiction issues worse.\n\n\"I appreciate they are in a crisis right now,\" Tavon said. \"It's like you're going to war, like you're faced with, 'What's the least bad option?' \"\n\nAs a temporary measure, a city-operated encampment could serve a vital role in connecting homeless residents with necessary services, said Dr. Jessie Gaeta, a physician with Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program.\n\n\"Temporary help that includes a sanctioned sleeping area where you can build more infrastructure and help is important for communities to consider doing,\" Gaeta said.\n\nThe controversy over the encampment proposal comes as New Bedford, which has seen its fortunes ebb and flow during its long history, is poised for a renaissance. It's home to the country's most valuable fishing port, which generates more than $11 billion in economic activity, and to an assembly facility for off-shore wind turbines. Its downtown has seen an influx of new restaurants and businesses, while the MBTA commuter rail is expected to begin service between the city and Boston next year.\n\nBut a rising tide has not lifted all boats. The city's median household income is about $54,000 -- nearly half the statewide figure of about $96,000, according to census data. About a third of its Hispanic residents live below the poverty line, along with a fifth of Black and Asian residents, according to a city report.\n\nDanielle Brown, director for Project FAIHR, which serves the area's homeless residents, said not enough is being done to get people off the streets. Those living outdoors who are warned by activists to leave one place simply move somewhere else.\n\n\"It's like I'm the hamster on the wheel, that's the best way to put it,\" Brown said.\n\nOn a recent Monday, Brown visited Cordeiro's campsite. They made plans for Brown's team to return with supplies, including food and bandages.\n\nCordeiro said she doesn't think leaders will change things in New Bedford. But she appeared to hold out hope that they might. Cordeiro paused briefly when asked what she'd tell the mayor.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Gavin Newsom, multiple news outlets reported Thursday -- the most high profile response yet to a June Supreme Court decision that allowed governments to crack down on homeless campers.\n\nAdvocates for the homeless have condemned camping bans as both inhumane and ineffective. In a press release on the day of the Supreme Court's decision, the National Housing Conference argued cracking down on camping without investing in more housing would be counterproductive. \"There are few more effective ways to condemn them to chronic homelessness than prosecuting rather than housing them,\" the statement reads. \"Ironically, the cost of incarceration is significantly greater than the cost of affordable housing.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court decision stems from a lawsuit filed in Oregon, in which two homeless people claimed that a city's ban on camping in public spaces violated the Eighth Amendment's protection against \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" Before the case reached the Supreme Court, a federal court on the West Coast sided with them, arguing the city could not punish people without access to shelter for sleeping in public places. In June, the Supreme Court reversed the decision, with all six Republican-appointed justices in the majority and the three liberals dissenting. In his opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch said that the Eighth Amendment does not allow federal judges to \"dictate this Nation's homelessness policy.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruel_and_unusual_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66a27891b3d612b57ad431e5/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1763,993,x0,y90,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Shortly thereafter, I commented on some of their most controversial decisions, including Trump v. United States, which gives presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution, and a number of other decisions in which the court struck down actions of administrative agencies left and right -- raising some question whether it is legal for the government to govern.\n\nStill, with so many new decisions to consider, there were a few other big ones I was unable to get to because of space limitations. One of those was City of Grants Pass, Oregon v. Johnson, which was, indirectly, a challenge to an earlier decision by the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Martin v. City of Boise. The Ninth Circuit had decided the Martin case in 2018 but the Supreme Court declined to review at that time. Martin had prohibited Boise, Idaho -- and by implication any municipality in the nine states covered by the Ninth Circuit -- from enforcing its anti-camping ordinances.\n\nThen, this past winter, the Supreme Court agreed to take up the Grants Pass case, and (implicitly) to reconsider Martin. Given the court's current composition (six conservatives and three liberals), the results seemed foreordained. The tenor of the oral argument last April seemed to predict this, too; and come the end of June, the majority opinion was written by Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nGorsuch's opinion seemed (for Gorsuch) positively humble in the court's approach to the problem. It had a number of passages like these drenched-in-irony phrases: \"Homelessness is complex. Its causes are many. So may be the public policy responses required to address it.\" And: \"Yes, people will disagree over which policy responses are best; they may experiment with one set of approaches only to find later another set works better . . . . But in our democracy, that is their right.\" Most hilariously: \"Nor can a handful of federal judges begin to 'match' the collective wisdom the American people possess in deciding 'how best to handle' a pressing social question like homelessness.\"\n\nGee, Neil . . . where was this \"Aw, shucks\" attitude when it comes to telling the EPA how to set pollution standards; or who should pay for federal monitors on fishing boats; or how to prosecute violations of securities laws? The Supreme Court seemed to think it had plenty of \"collective wisdom\" on those \"pressing social questions.\" But when it comes to policies that this court wants to turn over to local governments -- whether enforcing anti-camping laws or letting red states run rampant over reproductive decisions -- this Supreme Court is only too quick to say, \"Who are we to decide?\"\n\nStill, while the court's three liberals were quick to condemn the decision, they focused on only one issue raised by homelessness. Justice Sonia Sotomayor began her dissent by stating: \"Sleep is a biological necessity, not a crime. For some people, sleeping outside is their only option. The City of Grants Pass jails and fines those people for sleeping anywhere in public at any time . . . . For people with no access to shelter, that punishes them for being homeless.\"\n\nWell . . . not entirely. But the decision did not really \"criminalize homelessness\" as some commentators have claimed. In some cities, there are literally city blocks rendered impassable to pedestrians because makeshift homeless encampments have occupied the sidewalks. The same is true of the businesses sometimes barricaded by such improvised mini-bivouacs. A not-entirely perfect analogy is that while anyone can check out a library book - another form of public property -- you can't renew keep renewing it indefinitely so no one else has a chance to read it, either.\n\nAnd likewise, allowing sidewalks and parks to be taken over by homeless encampments is not always the best (or safest) use of public property, either. Nothing attests to the political difficulties of this issue better than the number of voices, across the political spectrum, that praised the Court's decision just to hear the Grants Pass case.\n\nOne of them was California's very liberal governor, Gavin Newsom. As a former mayor, Newsom likely understood that making it possible to enforce anti-camping laws would give local officials a potentially crucial tool.\n\nIndeed, as the saying goes, politics makes strange bedfellows.", "source": {"uri": "ukiahdailyjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ukiah Daily Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frank_zotter_jr@ukiahdailyjournal.com", "name": "Frank

It may also propel U.S. localities into a \"race to the bottom\" in passing increasingly punitive policies aimed at locking up or banishing the unhoused.\n\nLike many West Coast localities, the town of Grants Pass, Ore., suffers from an acute affordable housing crisis and no homeless shelters for adults. In 2013, the city council hosted a meeting to \"identify solutions to the current vagrancy problem.\" Rather than expanding shelter or housing, the council passed ordinances that made it illegal to sleep outside with blankets, pillows or even cardboard. Every violation triggers a $275 fine, and after two citations a person may be issued an exclusion order across all public property.\n\nThis amounts to banishment from Grants Pass or incarceration for simply being homeless. As the city council president at the time said, \"The point is to make it uncomfortable enough for them in our city so they will want to move on down the road.\"\n\nWhile the Grants Pass scheme may be uniquely cruel, local governments enforce ordinances against standing, sitting, resting and sleeping in public space across the United States. Now that the minimal guardrails of legal protections for the homeless have been removed by the Supreme Court, it is more important than ever for local lawmakers not to fall prey to populist outrage to ramp up punitive crackdowns. They should instead heed the decades of social science research that shows them to be both counterproductive and cruel.\n\nSynthesizing over 50 published research papers on the impacts of these laws from small towns to large cities, a group of social scientists including myself filed a brief for the Supreme Court in the case. The research consistently arrived at a broad consensus. The enforcement of anti-homeless laws not only fails to reduce homelessness in public space beyond a few blocks, it also traps people in homelessness longer and exacerbates health conditions, all while creating numerous barriers to shelter, treatment, jobs and housing.\n\nEnforcement of anti-homeless laws has been shown to have various negative health impacts. For instance, a 2021 California study of 3,200 adults experiencing homelessness in eight counties found that 36 percent had their belongings taken and/or destroyed by local agencies while enforcing anti-homeless ordinances in just six months. Participants in this study and in other large surveys taken in Denver and Honolulu reported having lost life-saving medicine needed to treat HIV and Hepatitis C, ID and benefit cards, walkers, canes, crutches, and wheelchairs. Meanwhile, CDC scientists acknowledge that clearing encampments through enforcement increases the spread of infectious disease, increasing public health risks.\n\nA study surveying doctors and medical providers identified widespread frustration with enforcement. The houseless regularly avoid appointments or even hospitalization from fear that their property will be destroyed. Many lose benefits and prescriptions due to short incarcerations. All of this leads to negative health impacts, increased emergency room utilization and exorbitant health care costs on already strained systems.\n\nMany people experience incarceration for their first time due to their homelessness, but the consequences have lasting effects. Incarceration often means a loss of employment due to absence and increased difficulty securing new employment stemming from their newly acquired criminal record. The mark of a criminal record also leads to exclusions in the housing market due to landlord discrimination.\n\nTickets are often viewed as a civil infraction, but they can have the same punitive impacts. Unpaid citations in most U.S. localities result in arrest warrants, spoiled credit, suspensions of driver's licenses, and erect multiple barriers to exiting homelessness. In San Francisco, a study found that 90 percent of the 10,000 to 15,000 citations given to homeless people each year for sitting, camping or loitering go unpaid -- no surprise considering the poverty of those cited.\n\nNot only are those with warrants often barred from work and housing, they are also restricted from residential drug and mental health treatment programs, as well as homeless shelters in many states. Rather than working as sticks to push people towards better life choices and opportunity, studies consistently find that enforcement more often pulls people deeper into poverty and extends their homelessness.\n\nDespite the overwhelming evidence that these laws are ineffective, costly and harmful, they are politically popular. For politicians in power, enforcement reduces public outrage.\n\nSuch laws have been consistently found to do nothing to curb wider collective urban disorder or reduce homelessness in public space. But enforcement scratches the itch of individual angry residents and business owners dialing 911 to have their block spot-cleaned of homelessness. Meanwhile, political challengers often campaign on even harsher ordinances, blaming the persistence of homelessness on the incumbent's tolerance. Both positions distract from the real issue of the growing affordable housing crisis at the problem's root, which politicians are weary to address.\n\nEven if the Supreme Court had ruled in favor of the homeless plaintiffs, the truth is little would have changed without further political and legal pressure for reforms. And though Friday's ruling is a huge step backwards, it won't stop the ongoing legal cases to protect unhoused people's rights on Fourth, Fifth, and 14th amendment grounds of rights to property, due process and equal access to shelter.\n\nNonetheless, the court's decision now frees localities of even the lowest level of accountability in its criminal treatment of homelessness. It will also fuel political competition between cities, counties and even states to pass increasingly punitive policies as they try to push their unhoused residents \"down the road.\"", "source":

In late June, the Supreme Court issued its highly important ruling in Grants Pass v. Johnson, as the ruling granted cities more power to arrest, cite and fine homeless people who sleep outside in public places, which overturned six years of legal protections for homeless residents in California and other western states. One celebrity who may have celebrated the ruling is basketball television analyst Charles Barkley. During the TV broadcast of the 2024 NBA All-Star Game, Barkley criticized the city of San Francisco and its homeless population while remarking to his other on-air TV announcers, \"If you had a chance of being in the cold or being around a bunch of homeless crooks in San Francisco, which would you take?\"\n\nCharles Barkley has had a wealthy post-NBA playing career out of saying ridiculous, foolish things for laughs and shock value. It might be implied that calling a number of people in San Francisco \"homeless crooks\" as one of his usual absurd statements except he also said in 2022 on an NBA television broadcast that, \"San Francisco, you know, it's a great city. All that dirtiness and homelessness, y'all gotta clean that off the streets.\" Strangely, Barkley's comments about the homeless in San Francisco don't point the finger at the absurdity and ugliness of homelessness in a country that has enough houses for every human being to be provided with shelter. Through the years, Charles Barkley has shown himself to be devoid of character and substance when it comes to most real-life issues affecting the most vulnerable groups of people.\n\nAs it relates to Grants Pass v. Johnson decision, it is a significant setback to the constitutional and human rights of homeless people, and local governments will feel more confident passing punitive policies with the Supreme Court's decision. There have been strong statements made by advocacy groups for the homeless. \"This decision sets a dangerous precedent that will cause undue harm to people experiencing homelessness and give free reign to local officials who prefer pointless and expensive arrests and imprisonment, rather than real solutions,\" said Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. \"At a time when elected officials need to be focused on long-term, sustainable solutions that are grounded in evidence - including funding the affordable housing and supportive services that their constituents need -- this ruling allows leaders to shift the burden to law enforcement. This tactic has consistently failed to reduce homelessness in the past, and it will assuredly fail to reduce homelessness in the future.\"", "source": {"uri": "thyblackman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThyBlackMan"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grants_Pass,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grants Pass, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://thyblackman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grants-Pass-v.-Johnson.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763547", "eventUri": "eng-9763547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 93, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 223710056, "title": "Pickleball players return to Riverside Park courts after vandal repeatedly cuts nets", "text": "An unknown vandal recently caused about $2,800 in damage at pickleball courts in Riverside Park on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side by slashing nets and absconding with equipment on multiple occasions when no one could stop him, according to police and parks officials. But the local pickleball community has remained undeterred in pursuing their pastime, coming together to raise funds for new court nets that are now kept safe overnight in two locked metal boxes. \u201cSomeone wants to take away our fun,\u201d said Mei King, a 55-year-old who plays at the courts at 110th Street, between matches on Friday afternoon. \u201cA fun-thief,\u201d chimed in her pickleball partner, Tayna Shen. \u201cLook at our beautiful community here coming to play, and then everything is destroyed.\u201d A spokesperson for the NYPD said there were currently no suspects while the investigation continues. One pickleball player, Eduardo Valentin, said the slashing of the nets first started about six weeks ago and was discovered when people showed up to play. Pickleball has grown wildly popular in New York City over the past few years, drawing both fervent fans and irked detractors. The Riverside Park courts, which are about a year old, are heavily used: On Friday, dozens of players were there as the sound of plastic balls being hit and laughter could be heard from a hundred yards away. Community members said they did not believe the vandalism was related to the sport\u2019s meteoric rise. \u201cIt's not making any noise,\u201d said Valentin. \u201cWe don't know if it's a net issue or a what issue. We don't know.\"", "summary": "<img src=\"https://images-prod.gothamist.com/original_images/P5242576.JPG\" alt=\"People play pickleball at the courts at Riverside Park on the Upper West Side on May 24, 2024.\" />\n  \n    <p>People play pickleball at the courts at Riverside Park on the Upper West Side on May 24, 2024.</p>\n  \n\n<p>Upper West Side pickleballers donated new nets to the court that are now kept overnight in a locked metal box.

Then, at his March 27 show in Brooklyn, Springsteen made a surprise appearance to perform the song with Bryan during the encore. (Springsteen then stayed on to help Bryan play his usual show-closer, \"Revival,\" with Maggie Rogers also returning after dueting \"Dawns\" with Bryan earlier in the gig.)\n\nIt's possible Bryan turned the studio version of \"Sandpaper\" into a duet with Springsteen following the Brooklyn gig. At the time, a source familiar with Bryan's concert logistics told Rolling Stone that Springsteen had flown back to Brooklyn in the midst of his own tour with the E Street Band, and that he'd learned \"Sandpaper\" on the day of the show.\n\nAlong with Springsteen's appearance on \"Sandpaper,\" The Great American Bar Scene features Bryan's collaboration with John Mayer, \"Better Days.\" Bryan has also played that song a bunch on tour this year, with Mayer joining him for a live rendition in Los Angeles back in June.\n\nThe Great American Bar Scene marks Bryan's fifth studio album and follows his hit 2023 self-titled record. Bryan announced the LP last month and prior to its release shared a pair of songs, \"Pink Skies\" and \"Purple Gas.\" (The latter was originally written and performed by Noeline Hofmann, who duets it with Bryan on The Great American Bar Scene.)\n\nBryan has shows scheduled through the end of the year. His summer run wraps Aug. 26 in Grand Forks, North Dakota, after he'll play a bunch of gigs in November and early December, wrapping with two nights in Brooklyn on Dec. 18 and 19.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_blistein@rollingstone.com", "name": "Jon Blistein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Springsteen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Rogers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maggie Rogers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_Street_Band", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E Street Band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Days_(Goo_Goo_Dolls_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Better Days (Goo Goo Dolls song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LP record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pink (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Forks,_North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Forks, North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grand Forks, North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women_in_Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women in Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bruce-zach-bryan.jpg?crop=0px%2C9px%2C1798px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705573", "eventUri": "eng-9705573", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-18", "dateEnd": "-12-19", "textStart": 1756, "textEnd": 1770}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-27", "textStart": 270, "textEnd": 278}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-26", "textStart": 1613, "textEnd": 1620}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

In addition to featuring 'The Boss', Noeline Hoffman appears on 'Purple Gas', John Mayer assisted on 'Better Days', and John Moreland added his touches to 'Memphis; The Blues'.\n\nAlthough albums are traditionally released on Friday's, Bryan has a habit of operating differently to the industry norms, and so far, it's working well for the Oklahoman. Recently, he headlined his first stadium show, and has spent much of the last 12 months glued to the road, playing sold-out arenas in North America on a nightly basis.\n\nThe new track with Springsteen was premiered in March when the New Jersey hero appeared at Bryan's show in New York to perform 'Sandpaper' as well as the set finale, 'Revival', with Maggie Rogers. Bryan hinted at the surprise appearance by wearing a Springsteen t-shirt for the concert and also using 'Johnny 99' as his walk-on song. The singer-songwriter has previously been open about his love of 'The Boss', notably covering 'I'm on Fire'.\n\nAt the time of the show, Springsteen was on tour with the E-Street Band in Los Angeles, but flew to New York specifically to appear with the rising star, who had his first chart-topping album in 2023 with the eponymous, Zach Byran.\n\nDuring the day of the duet, Springsteen learned 'Sandpaper', which was initially wrote as a solo effort before 'The Boss' transformed it into a duet.\n\nPrior to the album being released on July 4th, coinciding with Independence Day in the United States, Bryan selected a list of 23 bars across America which he granted early access to The Great American Bar Scene from June 24th.\n\nExplaining his decision, Bryan said in a statement: \"My intent with all this is to give everyone an early glimpse of this album, but more importantly, this is in the spirit of bringing people together for a memorable moment. I have chose(n) 23 bars across the country that embody the spirit of American culture.\"\n\nThe 'I Remember Everything' singer continued: \"These bars will play select cuts from The Great American Bar Scene starting June 24th. As much as I'd kill to play all these timeless bars, it won't be possible. I will be visiting a few off the list to have a drink with ya'll. The Great American Bar Scene will be released on July 4th.

In that clip, Bryan delivers the entirety of the song's vocals while Mayer helms an ethereal guitar solo with a bit of country twang.\n\nAfter the performance, Mayer took to his Sirius XM radio show, Life with John Mayer, to throw some major kudos Bryan's way, calling his concert \"one of the most incredible things I've seen in years.\"\n\n\"He's cracked some code that I have been waiting for someone to crack,\" he continued. \"He's tapped into a thing with people that should give everyone hope. Sometimes you start feeling like, 'Oh, it's going to be a long time before a lot of people like one thing again,' [but] a lot of people like Zach Bryan shows. Myself included. It was unbelievable.\"\n\nLikewise, Bryan and Springsteen's collaborative effort on the album likely refers to the unreleased track \"Sandpaper,\" which the pair performed together at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., in March, per footage shared by the arena on Instagram.\n\nPrior to that performance, Bryan performed \"Sandpaper\" live for the first time as a solo effort at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., Springsteen's home state.\n\nJust two months later in the Big Apple, Bryan and Springsteen took to the stage together alongside \"Alaska\" singer Maggie Rogers at Madison Square Garden to perform Bryan's hit song \"Revival\"\n\nBryan and his girlfriend Brianna \"Chickenfry\" Lapaglia have openly shown their love for the \"Glory Days\" hitmaker in recent months, with Bryan frequently donning a \"United States Vs.

The Great American Bar Scene includes Bryan's recent singles, the transcendent \"Pink Skies\" and the Noeline Hoffman collab \"Purple Gas.\" It also has features from some huge names, headlined by none other than Bruce Springsteen, who recently performed with Bryan in Brooklyn.

He also puts in a request for \"Hey Porter\" in that same song, for the record, but while Bryan does not have the clout to get Johnny Cash to rise from the grave and put it an appearance, he does have the cultural pull to get Mr. Nebraska himself to show up later on his record. Their duet of the new song \"Sandpaper\" was not not officially announced until the album's midnight release, but it won't come as any surprise, after they already sang it together at a Bryan show in Brooklyn back in March. The younger singer is so steeped in the elder that it almost feels like a torch-passing, even though I imagine Springsteen really only surrendering the flame when they pry it out of his cold, dead hands.\n\n\"Sandpaper\" is one of several songs on \"Great American Bar Scene\" to include a feature, with the others including \"Better Days,\" which sports some Dead-ly (as in \"& Company\") electric guitar playing from John Mayer, and \"Memphis: The Blues,\" which makes good use of Americana hero John Moreland. That's a reasonably healthy guest list, though you may be wondering what happened to the support for women artists that was evident in the lineup of cameos on his previous album, 2023's \"Zach Bryan.\" Well, there's a surprise in store there: although she doesn't get featured billing, the voice of 20-year-old Canadian artist Noeline Hoffman starts blasting out of the speakers about halfway through \"Purple Gas,\" which impressed Bryan so much when he heard it that it became the first time he ever included a straight-up cover on one of his five albums to date. It's a move that's got to warm your heart toward Bryan, no matter how you feel about him coming in, that he's willing to cede prominent real estate on a major release to someone who can use a leg up as well as indulge in some make-a-wish phone calls.\n\nHoffman's \"Purple Gas\" might even be the best song on the record, truth be told. But there's no mistaking how much the spirit of Springsteen looms over the album, as much as it has over much of Bryan's short, meteoric career to date -- it's like the Chekhovian gun introduced in the first act that was bound to go off in the third with an actual feature. The weird part is obviously not that a heartland guy is taking cues from Bruce, even though that's less common than it was 30 or more years ago. It's that he's taking them from \"Nebraska,\" Springsteen's super-stripped-down 1982 outlier album, and then still somehow managing to inspire \"Born in the USA\"-style mania among his stadium and arena crowds with the contemplative stuff. It doesn't hurt that there's no actual murder, or threat of it, here; no state troopers will be harmed in the making of this country-adjacent music. But it's still kind of wonderfully weird that an Okie so inspired by Bruce's ballads is turning that somewhat sullen model into chartbusting stuff. It almost gives you a reason to believe.\n\n\"The Great American Bar Scene\" actually feels a lot less stark than last year's self-titled record did. I think I'll still end up preferring that album more, as the one that turned me on to Bryan, with its peculiar, low-fi self-production values -- probably the same reason that I expect rank-and-file fans who had a few minor complaints about that will take more of a shine to this one. For better or worse, there are no live and crushingly loud bullfrogs included on the new record. (I miss 'em.) But \"slicker\" is a relative thing when it comes to Zach Bryan records, and even the part of his fan base that overlaps with Luke Bryan's would probably argue that they come to him because they're attracted to organic produce, too. And so there are plenty of tracks among the 19 that have not much more to them than acoustic guitar and the stray Dobro, with house drummer Jake Weinberg being asked to tap lightly or even sit things out so often, you'd think this was a bluegrass record. There's no evidence Bryan is looking for a fresh banger to replace \"Revival\" as his inevitable show-closer; it's kind of stunning, really, when someone who draws crowds as big Bryan's is spending so little time manipulating the rabble-rousing dial. But I suspect he's onto something: medium-tempo is the new barnburner.\n\nOh, and if you like albums that start off with a poem, \"The Great American Bar Scene\" begins that way, just like the previous album, albeit at several times the length. \"If I'm Lucky Enough\" is a statement-of-purpose and vision chart that includes aspirations from the past (\"I'll meet some kids in school that still know how to play instruments\"), future (\"I'll have some kids and teach them that we are all the same / Sufferin' the smilin' silhouettes of every passin' day\"), and eternal (with the hope \"to only die on hills that are closest to my heart\"). He's already thrown out an album's worth of aphorisms, over an ambient guitar, in the five minutes before the singing part begins. Having been so outrightly confessional with that spoken-word overture, he turns to fiction in the first proper song, \"Mechanical Bull,\" the acoustic-slide-guitar-driven lament of a former rodeo cowboy who's only likely to take rides inside barrooms from here on out. The theme isn't especially original, but Bryan gets some great lines in, saying he gets \"a little sad in the eve'nins / Knowin' I'll never get a beatin' / Like being young and dumb again.\"\n\nFrom there, the singer throws in a few character sketches amid apparent portraits of his real life. In the latter category are songs like \"28,\" a song fresh enough to have obviously been written since Bryan turned that age in early April. \"Took 28 years of blood I was lost in / To feel loved on my own birthday,\" he admits, in perhaps the album's most affecting line, expressing his affection for someone who \"took a train to the south side of Boston (and) showed me where your whole heart stayed.\" That fits with what we know of Bryan's girlfriend -- Boston-bred \"Barstool Sports\" personality Brianna Chickenfry -- and other songs that suggest his upbringing wasn't all hugs and flowers. \"I was raised by a woman who was hardly impressed / And I carry that shit real deep in my chest,\" he sings in \"Bass Boat,\" a song that starts with memories of peaceful fishing with a father, and somehow quickly moves on to acknowledging that \"even with my baby sitting next to me / I'm a self sabotaging suicide machine.\"\n\nOccasionally, he's going the more overtly \"Nebraska\"-ian, short-story route, like \"Oak Island,\" in which he identifies himself as \"Mickey\" and goes looking for a wayward brother who's run afoul of some thugs, looking to straighten things out by any means necessary because \"no blood in the mud I's raised in spends life on the run.\" (The contractions \"I's,\" \"we's,\" \"they's\" and \"you's\" pop up a lot in Bryan songs.)\n\nAnd he has insisted that the album's first single, \"Pink Skies,\" a song about a family funeral, has nothing to do with his mother's untimely death, which he's written about a lot in previous albums, but sprang out of his funereal imagination. In that one there's a poignancy to the imagery about emptying a family homestead for a sale that anyone grieving the loss of a family elder may relate to: \"Clear the drawers / Mop the floors / Stand tall / Like no one's ever been here, before or at all.\" For all the sadness inherent in that, \"Pink Skies\" has to be the most cheerful-sounding song about the rituals of gathering for last rites since Lyle Lovett's \"Since the Last Time.\" Bryan believes in tears, but not tearjerking, and so a number like \"Pink Skies\" that flirts with tougher emotions ends up being as stoic as it is bittersweet.\n\nIf there's a complaint to be made about any of the songwriting here, it's that sometimes some of Bryan's best lines feel like they could belong as much in another song as the one they're in. He can skip around between incidents, emotions and time frames so much within a single song that it's not always easy to tell whether he's being deliberately elliptical or just has a case of lyrical ADHD. At 28, he's good -- very good, in fact -- but still has some growth ahead of him in achieving the discipline of songwriting heroes like Springsteen and Jason Isbell. The song \"Northern Thunder\" feels like it's about to become a real statement of Where Zach Bryan Is Now, with its pithy summary of his post-Navy rise to fame: \"Mama, I made a million dollars on accident / I was supposed to die a military man / Chest out too far with a drink in my hand / But I've got folks who like hearing me rhyme.\" But when just a few lines later he claims that \"it ain't been my week, ain't been my year,\" it begs more questions than the tune is prepared to answer. Maybe Bryan just means to tell us that it's lonely at the instant-top, but the song isn't really developed enough to explain whether his smashing breakout success really coincided with an annus horribilus, or whether these lines just tumbled out kind of randomly.\n\nYet there's also a way in which the aimlessness of some of his material is a feature, not a flaw. Most of today's pop and certainly a lot of the mainstream country that so much of his audience is listening to are schematic, to an extreme. And so probably it feels refreshing to his fans -- as it can to a critic -- that Bryan's songs don't always have a single path or destination, and that a number that begins with a memory of his dad's \"Bass Boat\" surely isn't going to stay there for more a verse, the way it would if this were high-concept Nashville fodder.\n\nSpeaking of Nashville, Bryan lets his uneasy, borderline-adversarial relationship with the mainstream country community come to the fore as possible subject matter just once, in \"Like Ida,\" where he seems to be addressing a woman who might've gone to Music City to hit it big. \"When you make it to Nashville,\" he sings, \"You can tell by one hat tilt / That shit just ain't my scene / I like out of tune guitars / And taking jokes too far / And my bartender's Extra Damn Mean.\" The way that he capitalizes Extra Damn Mean in the lyric sheet certainly suggests he's making an EDM joke; who knows if it's because he's experienced the same thing many people in the industry have -- that at so many official country music functions, the DJ is playing electronic dance music, not country. Anyway, by the end of the song, Bryan is slamming just about everything mainstream, making callouts to the \"sound of that rusty door hinge\" and proclaiming, \"That bullshit you see on the late-night TV / Is a long way from our beatin' hearts.\"\n\nThat sentiment borders on being the heartland version of indie rabble-rousing. But it's hard to doubt for a second that Bryan really means it when he declares that he's marching to the beat of his own heart's different drummer. And when someone like him comes along who's determined to do things his own way and not via the accepted media and industry channels, you have to wonder if his notoriously system-bucking qualities will inspire fans to embrace him as a mere complement to the Luke Bryans of the world, or, for a few of them anyway, as an actual replacement.\n\n\"The Great American Bar Scene\" is not a glad-handing kind of record. It's not even an album that goes out of its way to ingratiate itself as, like, bar music. (Bryan promoted the album by giving some of the songs out in preview form to 23 bars across the nation, and you may wonder whether the bartenders had to turn up these mostly quiet numbers extra-loud to be heard over the din.) The singer-songwriter loves his band, who he's brought along from his Oklahoma days, as anyone who's seen his concerts know. But he's not always worried about putting all of them to use at once, that's for sure. Many songs begin with acoustic finger-picking, and quite a few of them stay there. This balladic emphasis could wear out its welcome, too, without enough variation over 19 tracks, and so it's welcome when he mixes things up a bit. \"American Nights\" is one of these standouts, for the way it takes a big volume jump on the second verse and ends up with a deliciously dry snare drum sound and a cool, miniaturist band feel you wouldn't mind hearing a lot more of.\n\nThere's more of that easygoing snare-drum shuffle in \"Memphis; The Blues,\" Bryan's duet with Moreland, in which he sings the praises of that Tennessee mecca's signature artform -- calling out Beale Street and B.B. and Otis redding -- without ever sounding like he's trying to imitate a bluesman himself. This isn't a hugely eccentric record, in its sound; as previously mentioned, that was more a characteristic of last year's album release. But Bryan does take some interesting chances here and there, like on \"Bass Boat,\" in which the emphasis is on him tinkling around on the very uppermost keys of a not-so-grand piano, as if he wants us to feel, in the time-honored tradition, that the piano has been drinking.\n\nAs for the Mayer collab, the guest artist does not lend a lead vocal to his track, just lead guitar, in such short and tasteful dollops that it almost seems not indulgent enough -- but \"Better Days\" is one of the better numbers. Springsteen's guest spot is a vocal one, of course, on \"Sandpaper,\" and it's nice to hear the master and student together -- laconic on laconic -- along with the addition of some baritone guitar from Chris Braun. Maybe it's a bit peculiar to hear Springsteen, a guy who is not in his 20s, keep repeating the lyrics' autobiographical refrain about \"27 seasons,\" but you could write that off as Bryan dueting with his nostalgic future self. As for the drums being played as light rim shots, the nod to the percussion on Springsteen songs like \"I'm on Fire\" might seem a little too obvious, if not for the exculpatory fact that this homage is being played -- like most of the album's drums -- by Jake Weinberg, the son of Max.\n\nWhen the album gets to its climax, of sorts, that turns out to be \"Pink Skies,\" the teaser track that everybody's already heard for weeks. But it's a nice touch when the song is extended for about 50 seconds longer than what you've previously heard, with a coda that has a couple of Bryan's band members taking over the lead vocals. It's a beautiful touch that reinforces the communal spirit of the song... and of Bryan's whole humble vibe. (It's not the first time that Bryan pulls off this neat trick on the album; \"Northern Thunder\" ends with background vocalist Bree Tranter unexpectedly getting the final line all to herself.)\n\n\"Pink Skies\" is followed by a lovely epilogue, \"Bathwater,\" which ends things on an even more subdued moment, notwithstanding the line where Bryan veritably shouts, \"Boy, get up and dance.\" There's a bit more country music commentary that comes along in rounding out the album, as the song laments the \"808 beats\" in the \"songs (that) used to free me,\" and also the whole faux-outlaw imagery of the modern genre. \"Now everyone knows an outlaw, country to the core,\" he sings, \"but the only outlaw I've known served in the Corps. And I ain't heard 'Shake the Frost' in a couple years or more.\" Closing an album out with twin nods to his military background and to Tyler Childers, with a bit of shade toward Nashville, is very Zach Bryan. And it's a good portent of a future in which the singer-songwriter, for all of his hero worship of Springsteen and others, stands a fairly decent chance of being remembered as a one-of-one.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Bryan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Bryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Springsteen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Bryan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luke Bryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65th_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "65th Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Moreland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Moreland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_in_the_U.S.A._(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Born in the U.S.A.

Take on the Bold Broadway Hit 6 days ago\n\nIn the title track of \"The Great American Bar Scene,\" the 19-track album Zach Bryan is putting out for the 4th of July, the singer-songwriter name-checks a Bruce Springsteen song, \"State Trooper,\" ordering that someone put it on the jukebox. He also puts in a request for \"Hey Porter\" in that same song, for the record, but while Bryan does not have the clout to get Johnny Cash to rise from the grave and put it an appearance, he does have the cultural pull to get Mr. Nebraska himself to show up later on his record. Their duet of the new song \"Sandpaper\" was not not officially announced until the album's midnight release, but it won't come as any surprise, after they already sang it together at a Bryan show in Brooklyn back in March. The younger singer is so steeped in the elder that it almost feels like a torch-passing, even though I imagine Springsteen really only surrendering the flame when they pry it out of his cold, dead hands.\n\n\"Sandpaper\" is one of several songs on \"Great American Bar Scene\" to include a feature, with the others including \"Better Days,\" which sports some Dead-ly (as in \"& Company\") electric guitar playing from John Mayer, and \"Memphis: The Blues,\" which makes good use of Americana hero John Moreland. That's a reasonably healthy guest list, though you may be wondering what happened to the support for women artists that was evident in the lineup of cameos on his previous album, 2023's \"Zach Bryan.\" Well, there's a surprise in store there: although she doesn't get featured billing, the voice of 20-year-old Canadian artist Noeline Hoffman starts blasting out of the speakers about halfway through \"Purple Gas,\" which impressed Bryan so much when he heard it that it became the first time he ever included a straight-up cover on one of his five albums to date. It's a move that's got to warm your heart toward Bryan, no matter how you feel about him coming in, that he's willing to cede prominent real estate on a major release to an upstart who can use a leg up, as well as indulge in some make-a-wish phone calls.\n\nHoffman's \"Purple Gas\" might even be the best song on the record, truth be told. But there's no mistaking how much the spirit of Springsteen looms over the album, as much as it has over much of Bryan's short, meteoric career to date -- it's like the Chekhovian gun introduced in the first act that was bound to go off in the third with an actual feature. The weird part is obviously not that a heartland guy is taking cues from Bruce, even though that's less common than it was 30 or more years ago. It's that he's taking them from \"Nebraska,\" Springsteen's super-stripped-down 1982 outlier album, and then still somehow managing to inspire \"Born in the USA\"-style mania among his stadium and arena crowds with the contemplative stuff. It doesn't hurt that there's no actual murder, or threat of it, here; no state troopers will be harmed in the making of this country-adjacent music. But it's still kind of wonderfully weird that an Okie so inspired by Bruce's ballads is turning that somewhat sullen model into chartbusting stuff. It almost gives you a reason to believe.\n\n\"The Great American Bar Scene\" actually feels a lot less stark than last year's self-titled record did. I think I'll still end up preferring that album more, as the one that turned me on to Bryan, with its peculiar, low-fi self-production values -- probably the same reason that I expect rank-and-file fans who had a few minor complaints about that will take more of a shine to this one. For better or worse, there are no live and crushingly loud bullfrogs included on the new record. (I miss 'em.) But \"slicker\" is a relative thing when it comes to Zach Bryan records, and even the part of his fan base that overlaps with Luke Bryan's would probably argue that they come to him because they're attracted to organic produce, too. And so there are plenty of tracks among the 19 that have not much more to them than acoustic guitar and the stray Dobro, with house drummer Jake Weinberg being asked to tap lightly or even sit things out so often, you'd think this was a bluegrass record. There's no evidence Bryan is looking for a fresh banger to replace \"Revival\" as his inevitable show-closer; it's kind of stunning, really, when someone who draws crowds as big Bryan's is spending so little time manipulating the rabble-rousing dial. But I suspect he's onto something: medium-tempo is the new barnburner.\n\nOh, and if you like albums that start off with a poem, \"The Great American Bar Scene\" begins that way, just like the previous album, albeit at several times the length. \"If I'm Lucky Enough\" is a statement-of-purpose and vision chart that includes aspirations from the past (\"I'll meet some kids in school that still know how to play instruments\"), future (\"I'll have some kids and teach them that we are all the same / Sufferin' the smilin' silhouettes of every passin' day\"), and eternal (with the hope \"to only die on hills that are closest to my heart\"). He's already thrown out an album's worth of aphorisms, over an ambient guitar, in the five minutes before the singing part begins. Having been so outrightly confessional with that spoken-word overture, he turns to fiction in the first proper song, \"Mechanical Bull,\" the acoustic-slide-guitar-driven lament of a former rodeo cowboy who's only likely to take rides inside barrooms from here on out. The theme isn't especially original, but Bryan gets some great lines in, saying he gets \"a little sad in the eve'nins / Knowin' I'll never get a beatin' / Like being young and dumb again.\"\n\nFrom there, the singer throws in a few character sketches amid apparent portraits of his real life. In the latter category are songs like \"28,\" a song fresh enough to have obviously been written since Bryan turned that age in early April. \"Took 28 years of blood I was lost in / To feel loved on my own birthday,\" he admits, in perhaps the album's most affecting line, expressing his affection for someone who \"took a train to the south side of Boston (and) showed me where your whole heart stayed.\" That fits with what we know of Bryan's girlfriend -- Boston-bred \"Barstool Sports\" personality Brianna Chickenfry -- and other songs that suggest his upbringing wasn't all hugs and flowers. \"I was raised by a woman who was hardly impressed / And I carry that shit real deep in my chest,\" he sings in \"Bass Boat,\" a song that starts with memories of peaceful fishing with a father, and somehow quickly moves on to acknowledging that \"even with my baby sitting next to me / I'm a self sabotaging suicide machine.\"\n\nOccasionally, he's going the more overtly \"Nebraska\"-ian, short-story route, like \"Oak Island,\" in which he identifies himself as \"Mickey\" and goes looking for a wayward brother who's run afoul of some thugs, looking to straighten things out by any means necessary because \"no blood in the mud I's raised in spends life on the run.\" (The contractions \"I's,\" \"we's,\" \"they's\" and \"you's\" pop up a lot in Bryan songs.)\n\nAnd he has insisted that the album's first single, \"Pink Skies,\" a song about a family funeral, has nothing to do with his mother's untimely death, which he's written about a lot in previous albums, but sprang out of his funereal imagination. In that one there's a poignancy to the imagery about emptying a family homestead for a sale that anyone grieving the loss of a family elder may relate to: \"Clear the drawers / Mop the floors / Stand tall / Like no one's ever been here, before or at all.\" For all the sadness inherent in that, \"Pink Skies\" has to be the most cheerful-sounding song about the rituals of gathering for last rites since Lyle Lovett's \"Since the Last Time.\" Bryan believes in tears, but not tearjerking, and so a number like \"Pink Skies\" that flirts with tougher emotions ends up being as stoic as it is bittersweet.\n\nIf there's a complaint to be made about any of the songwriting here, it's that sometimes some of Bryan's best lines feel like they could belong as much in another song as the one they're in. He can skip around between incidents, emotions and time frames so much within a single song that it's not always easy to tell whether he's being deliberately elliptical or just has a case of lyrical ADHD. At 28, he's good -- very good, in fact -- but still has some growth ahead of him in achieving the discipline of songwriting heroes like Springsteen and Jason Isbell. The song \"Northern Thunder\" feels like it's about to become a real statement of Where Zach Bryan Is Now, with its pithy summary of his post-Navy rise to fame: \"Mama, I made a million dollars on accident / I was supposed to die a military man / Chest out too far with a drink in my hand / But I've got folks who like hearing me rhyme.\" But when just a few lines later he claims that \"it ain't been my week, ain't been my year,\" it begs more questions than the tune is prepared to answer. Maybe Bryan just means to tell us that it's lonely at the instant-top, but the song isn't really developed enough to explain whether his smashing breakout success really coincided with an annus horribilus, or whether these lines just tumbled out kind of randomly.\n\nYet there's also a way in which the aimlessness of some of his material is a feature, not a flaw. Most of today's pop and certainly a lot of the mainstream country that so much of his audience is listening to are schematic, to an extreme. And so probably it feels refreshing to his fans -- as it can to a critic -- that Bryan's songs don't always have a single path or destination, and that a number that begins with a memory of his dad's \"Bass Boat\" surely isn't going to stay there for more a verse, the way it would if this were high-concept Nashville fodder.\n\nSpeaking of Nashville, Bryan lets his uneasy, borderline-adversarial relationship with the mainstream country community come to the fore as possible subject matter just once, in \"Like Ida,\" where he seems to be addressing a woman who might've gone to Music City to hit it big. \"When you make it to Nashville,\" he sings, \"You can tell by one hat tilt / That shit just ain't my scene / I like out of tune guitars / And taking jokes too far / And my bartender's Extra Damn Mean.\" The way that he capitalizes Extra Damn Mean in the lyric sheet certainly suggests he's making an EDM joke; who knows if it's because he's experienced the same thing many people in the industry have -- that at so many official country music functions, the DJ is playing electronic dance music, not country. Anyway, by the end of the song, Bryan is slamming just about everything mainstream, making callouts to the \"sound of that rusty door hinge\" and proclaiming, \"That bullshit you see on the late-night TV / Is a long way from our beatin' hearts.\"\n\nThat sentiment borders on being the heartland version of indie rabble-rousing. But it's hard to doubt for a second that Bryan really means it when he declares that he's marching to the beat of his own heart's different drummer. And when someone like him comes along who's determined to do things his own way and not via the accepted media and industry channels, you have to wonder if his notoriously system-bucking qualities will inspire fans to embrace him as a mere complement to the Luke Bryans of the world, or, for a few of them anyway, as an actual replacement.\n\n\"The Great American Bar Scene\" is not a glad-handing kind of record. It's not even an album that goes out of its way to ingratiate itself as, like, bar music. (Bryan promoted the album by giving some of the songs out in preview form to 23 bars across the nation, and you may wonder whether the bartenders had to turn up these mostly quiet numbers extra-loud to be heard over the din.) The singer-songwriter loves his band, who he's brought along from his Oklahoma days, as anyone who's seen his concerts know. But he's not always worried about putting all of them to use at once, that's for sure. Many songs begin with acoustic finger-picking, and quite a few of them stay there. This balladic emphasis could wear out its welcome, too, without enough variation over 19 tracks, and so it's welcome when he mixes things up a bit. \"American Nights\" is one of these standouts, for the way it takes a big volume jump on the second verse and ends up with a deliciously dry snare drum sound and a cool, miniaturist band feel you wouldn't mind hearing a lot more of.\n\nThere's more of that easygoing snare-drum shuffle in \"Memphis; The Blues,\" Bryan's duet with Moreland, in which he sings the praises of that Tennessee mecca's signature artform -- calling out Beale Street and B.B. and Otis redding -- without ever sounding like he's trying to imitate a bluesman himself. This isn't a hugely eccentric record, in its sound; as previously mentioned, that was more a characteristic of last year's album release. But Bryan does take some interesting chances here and there, like on \"Bass Boat,\" in which the emphasis is on him tinkling around on the very uppermost keys of a not-so-grand piano, as if he wants us to feel, in the time-honored tradition, that the piano has been drinking.\n\nAs for the Mayer collab, the guest artist does not lend a lead vocal to his track, just lead guitar, in such short and tasteful dollops that it almost seems not indulgent enough -- but \"Better Days\" is one of the better numbers. Springsteen's guest spot is a vocal one, of course, on \"Sandpaper,\" and it's nice to hear the master and student together -- laconic on laconic -- along with the addition of some baritone guitar from Chris Braun. Maybe it's a bit peculiar to hear Springsteen, a guy who is not in his 20s, keep repeating the lyrics' autobiographical refrain about \"27 seasons,\" but you could write that off as Bryan dueting with his nostalgic future self. As for the drums being played as light rim shots, the nod to the percussion on Springsteen songs like \"I'm on Fire\" might seem a little too obvious, if not for the exculpatory fact that this homage is being played -- like most of the album's drums -- by Jake Weinberg, the son of Max.\n\nWhen the album gets to its climax, of sorts, that turns out to be \"Pink Skies,\" the teaser track that everybody's already heard for weeks. But it's a nice touch when the song is extended for about 50 seconds longer than what you've previously heard, with a coda that has a couple of Bryan's band members taking over the lead vocals. It's a beautiful touch that reinforces the communal spirit of the song... and of Bryan's whole humble vibe. (It's not the first time that Bryan pulls off this neat trick on the album; \"Northern Thunder\" ends with background vocalist Bree Tranter unexpectedly getting the final line all to herself.)\n\n\"Pink Skies\" is followed by a lovely epilogue, \"Bathwater,\" which ends things on an even more subdued moment, notwithstanding the line where Bryan veritably shouts, \"Boy, get up and dance.\" There's a bit more country music commentary that comes along in rounding out the album, as the song laments the \"808 beats\" in the \"songs (that) used to free me,\" and also the whole faux-outlaw imagery of the modern genre. \"Now everyone knows an outlaw, country to the core,\" he sings, \"but the only outlaw I've known served in the Corps. And I ain't heard 'Shake the Frost' in a couple years or more.\" Closing an album out with twin nods to his military background and to Tyler Childers, with a bit of shade toward Nashville, is very Zach Bryan. And it's a good portent of a future in which the singer-songwriter, for all of his hero worship of Springsteen and others, stands a fairly decent chance of being remembered as a one-of-one.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Bryan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Bryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Springsteen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Bryan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luke Bryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65th_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "65th Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Strange_Loop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A Strange Loop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Moreland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Moreland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_in_the_U.S.A._(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Born in the U.S.A.

The LP is stuffed with 19 songs, including \"Sandpaper\" featuring Bruce Springsteen.\n\nIn late March, Springsteen surprised everyone and performed \"Sandpaper\" with Bryan during Bryan's Quittin' Time Tour show at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n\"Winter was a drag / But spring was a friend / I'll love you 'til the summer comes back again,\" Bryan and Springsteen sing in the song about stubborn, undying love.

I truly want to just say thank you for being so kind and patient, I'm really freaking grateful lately,\" Bryan offered via social media.\n\nHis notes about his process back then mirror his work at present:\n\n\"I've got no grand explanation for these songs, I got no riddle in the reasoning behind writing them, I don't have a ... roll-out plan to stuff it in front of as many people as I can,\" Bryan said.\n\n\"I just wrote some poems and songs I want to share because I think they're special. Some are heavy, some are hopeful, but more than anything, what's most important to me is that they're all mine. If people listen to it, I'll be grateful; if people don't, I'll still be grateful because I got the chance in this life to be original when it mattered.\"\n\nBryan's preface to the album's release offers that he views it as the culmination of a tumultuous worldwide journey.\n\n\"If you don't like it I assume it's not intended for you,\" he flatly states.\n\n\"Grab your beers through tears & tears, the Great American Bar Scene,\" he closes, with the chorus to the album's title song.", "source": {"uri": "tennessean.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tennessean"}, "authors": [],

You wouldn't think he could be much more stripped down than he's appeared on previous sets, but on The Great American Bar Scene, out today on Warner Records, he feels even rawer.\n\nThis is Bryan's fifth album in five years (there are also some EPs thrown in there for good measure) and his third since signing with Warner Records and breaking through with 2022's 34-track American Heartbreak. He followed that set with last year's self-titled 16-track effort that included his No. 1 Hot 100 hit, \"I Remember Everything\" with Kacey Musgraves, and also became his first No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nIn a very short time, the 28-year old Bryan has put together quite a canon. His ongoing conversation with his fans feels like he's sharing intimate observations with just a few key words that then leave the listener to fill in the details. It's a masterful skill.\n\nOn The Great American Bar Scene, Bryan is joined by one of his most obvious influences, Bruce Springsteen, on \"Sandpaper.\" Like The Boss, Bryan's music sounds uniquely American (which may explain why he dropped the album on the 4 of July) and traffics in troubled, common-man characters who easily lurk unnoticed in the shadows as they wrestle with their demons and sketchy circumstances. Bryan finds a less likely duet partner in John Mayer on \"Better Days.\"\n\nAt 19 tracks, the album feels less overstuffed than American Heartbreak, but could have still used a trim or two given the relative sameness in the sound of the tracks. However, Bryan's fans seem to have an unlimited capacity to absorb his prolific output.\n\nHere is a preliminary ranking of Bryan's The Great American Bar Scene. A double vinyl version will be released Oct. 10.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "melinda_newman@billboard.com", "name": "Melinda Newman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Records", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Bryan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Bryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriters Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R.E.M."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acoustic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tempo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heartbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Heartbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Prine", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Prine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kacey_Musgraves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kacey Musgraves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitrack_recording", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multitrack recording"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extended play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Springsteen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Mayer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Songwriting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/zach-bryan-press-credit-Trevor-Pavlik-film-2024-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705573", "eventUri": "eng-9705573", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1504, "textEnd": 1513}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-10", "textStart": 2106, "textEnd": 2113}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The man don't miss. One look at the tracklist and you'll see features with Bruce Springsteen, fellow Okie and songwriter extraordinaire John Moreland, and one of this generation's great guitarists... John Mayer.\n\nAnd I'll tell you what... I'm a BIG John Mayer guy. Yeah, the guy who sings \"Your Body Is A Wonderland,\" that's right (that song still slaps).\n\nJohn has a catalog that is deep, though. You may be most familiar with early pop stuff, but it's packed with different sounds and styles, blues, rock, pop... reflecting on the various seasons of his life and artistry. And if you have ever seen him live, you know that he can absolutely shred. Every song is like 8 minutes long. Don't get me wrong, I love his songwriting, but there's a reason he's played guitar with just about everybody in the business.\n\nThe collab with Zach Bryan however, was no surprise, as John joined Zach in Los Angeles recently to perform the song. He also heaped some high praise on Zach afterwards, calling his show \"one of the most incredible things I've seen in years.\"\n\nAnd now that it's the 4th of July, and The Great American Bar Scene is here, we finally have our official studio version of \"Better Days.\" Featuring John on both guitar and vocals (and a producer credit), we get some of John's signature blues licks as well as a tasty solo.\n\nMayer recently joined Zach during a stop on his Quittin' Time tour in Los Angeles, where the two performed an unreleased song together and stuck around for an epic performance of \"Revival.\"\n\nAnd after the show, Mayer spoke on his Sirius XM radio show, Life With John Mayer, about the incredible experience that is a Zach Bryan live show:\n\n\"It was one of the most incredible things I've seen in years. This guy and his band have the greatest camaraderie offstage, and therefore on stage. The crowd goes nuts. I've never seen a band change the space around them in an arena. An arena is sorta like, 'Here, you're using our room, do your thing in our room.'\n\nZach Bryan and his band are like, 'We're gonna take your room and we're gonna have a hoedown in it, thank you very much.'\"\n\nMayer also pointed out that Zach has been able to connect with fans in a way that few artists do:\n\n\"He's cracked some code that I have been waiting for someone to crack. He's tapped into a thing with people that should give everyone hope.\n\nCause sometimes you start feeling like, 'Oh, it's gonna be a long time before a lot of people like one thing again.' And a LOT of people like Zach Bryan shows, myself included, because it was unbelievable.\"\n\nNot bad coming from a music legend like John Mayer.\n\nYou can check out the full schedule of previous stops below, which even includes a few stadium dates in Denver, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Tampa and Minneapolis.\n\nOpeners on this run include the Turnpike Troubadours and Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit open up some shows, in addition to other heavy hitters in The War & Treaty, Mt. Joy, The Middle East, Sheryl Crow, Sierra Ferrell, Matt Maeson, and Levi Turner rotating dates on others.\n\nMay 09 Knoxville, TN Thompson-Boling Arena at Food City Center *^\n\nAugust 07 Philadelphia, PA Lincoln Financial Field %^", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Bryan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zach Bryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Moreland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Moreland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Body_Is_a_Wonderland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Your Body Is a Wonderland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Springsteen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Ferrell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Ferrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Maeson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Maeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Joy_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mt.

They congregate in dive bars, break each other's hearts, pound High Lifes, pop Zyn, ponder God, place parlays, rediscover their rural accents, act younger and feel older than they really are. The boys and girls in his America have such a rad time together. So why do they spend all their spare time remembering everything?\n\nThe feat of The Great American Bar Scene, Bryan's fifth record, his magic trick, to quote one of its many featured guests, Bruce Springsteen, is to make it seem like the life he sings about is still the one he's living. Since Bryan is such a preternaturally gifted songwriter, his new album's premise is as convincing as it is absurd: That America's most iron-hot rock star spends his time not on airplanes and in hockey arena green rooms but traversing dirty dives with the boys, losing money to sketchy Philly bookies, and staying up for sunrises on friend's apartment roofs.\n\nThe way Bryan wrestles with this contrast-between his newfound success and the homespun characters he writes about - and he wrestles with it quite a bit - is by leaning on remembrances of a recent restless past that's never far from his mind. \"Give me four minutes and a little 'bit of time,\" he sings on \"Bass Boat,\" another tune about his favorite topic: memory. \"I'll make them old days an old friend of mine.\"\n\nThese 19 songs feel like a batch of old friends largely because of Bryan's other magical gift: his knack for absorbing and transforming his many influences into something that feels uniquely his own. He's emerged as the foremost pop synthesizer of the past decade in singer-songwriter, country-rock, indie-folk, and heartland rock, blending his favorite Kings of Leon, Bon Iver, Turnpike Troubadours and Lumineers records into something that feels new to a younger audience.\n\nCall it the Great Americana Bar Jukebox: the way Bryan deploys mournful trumpets, like the National, to build tension (\"Oak Island\"), the traces of the Lumineers' feel-good playbook when he sings \"'cause I got you'\" in falsetto (\"Funny Man\"). Throughout the record, he channels his hero Tyler Childers' knack for writing in his characters' rural vernacular (see the album's surplus of \"they's\" and \"I's\" and \"you'se\"). On \"American Nights,\" he twists bro-country signifiers (Fords, tan lines) into a noir, Nebraska-esque tale tinged with violence and PTSD. On \"28,\" he sets a Jason Isbell-evoking chorus melody to the cello melodrama of the Avett Brothers. On the ballad \"Memphis; the Blues,\" he goes further, recruiting songwriting hero and fellow Okie John Moreland, for a co-write and a second verse. When, a few songs later, he enlists Springsteen himself for a duet, the song they trade verses on (\"Sandpaper') is an homage to \"I'm on Fire.\"\n\nBut part of Bryan's stunning commercial success may be that amidst all this influence-peddling, his closest songwriting contemporary is Taylor Swift, whose sui generis worldbuilding Bryan almost always pulls off for himself. Like Swift's recent work, he uses silence and space to turn otherwise sparse records into stadium sing-alongs. And as a lyricist, he's absorbed Swift's knack for detail (a worn-in baseball glove, a rusty door-hinge, a balled-up left fist).\n\nThe result is writing that blends endearing Kerouac cosplay, Instagram poetry, and Proustian profundity, sometimes from one line to the next, like on the last verse of \"The Way Back\". \"Pink Skies,\" the album's lead single (featuring Watchhouse, another influence) is a masterclass in storytelling that deploys sparse imagery about grief and family to pack a novel's worth of emotional punch into four minutes. In one image, Bryan nails the flood of memories and emotions his protagonist faces packing up a childhood home while grieving: \"All the inches..scraped on the door frame/We all know you tip toed up to 4'1 back in '08,\" he sings. Bryan is adept at letting scraps of dialogue do his narrative heavy-lifting, as he does on \"The Way Back,\" the story of a mother and her wayward adult son: \"She always sat under the oak tree/Sayin', 'God I miss the old me.'\"\n\nThat Bryan's latest would be even stronger if it were four songs shorter is beside the point. Among the many methods he's absorbed from his pop contemporaries (Swift, Drake, Morgan Wallen, Bad Bunny, et. al) is the modern concept of the album as Annual Content Dump. This one's cheerfully grandiose title is, unsurprisingly, a bait and switch: These are sad songs, small in scope and size (none run past four minutes). These are stories about alienated young adults shooting the bull and trading memories over pool tables and front stoops to both fend off and feed a nostalgia they feel crushed by before hitting 30. On The Great American Bar Scene, Bryan shows his fans just how much he relates: \"I always felt like I's in-between something,\" he sings on \"28.\" \"Like home and somewhere far away.\"", "source":

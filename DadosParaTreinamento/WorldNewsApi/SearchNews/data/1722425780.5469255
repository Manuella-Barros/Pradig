She buys newspapers at a store by the 8th Street C Train station and takes them to seniors living in East Village. \u201cThe are drugs and alcohol, it is horrible. You have to really hold onto your walker or hang onto your purse if you\u2019re walking here. It is so bad,\u201d Foy said on Friday, going for a walk near Century Gardens. Despite being robbed once, the 70-year-old is not deterred by what she sees near her home. In fact, she hands out scarves and mitts to people in need on the train platform. \u201cOne guy I walked up to, he was cold. So I asked him and he went for his pocket and I said: \u2018Don\u2019t stab me. I\u2019m just giving you something for free.\u2019 I am terrified out here too,\u201d Foy recalled. In an effort to make public spaces comfortable and accessible, Calgary police recently partnered with Transit Public Safety and Calgary Community Standards to disrupt drug trafficking at a number of \u201chot spots\u201d in the downtown and along the CTrain line. Seven people were arrested. The suspects face a total of 47 charges for drug trafficking, breaches of court-imposed conditions, fraud and weapons-related charges. Police say the behaviour demonstrated by these individuals can make people feel unsafe in public spaces. Calgary police say they recognize that street-level drug traffickers may be trapped in addiction. \u201cThroughout this operation, we worked with an AHS clinician to offer support and diversion courts in our city to ensure those who are candidates can be offered opportunities to access resources and the help they may need to find a different path,\u201d said Insp. Jason Bobrowich in a news release on Friday. \u201cI feel sorry for them, but you can only help so much,\u201d Foy said. \u201cFirst of all, there\u2019s no housing. They need more professional help.\u201d Last summer, new basketball courts opened at Century Gardens by the 8th Street train station. The thinking being, if areas like that are activated, there\u2019s a hope of elevating what goes on. On Friday afternoon, the courts were well used by people getting some outdoor exercise. Rhys Williams enjoys shooting hoops at the new court but he\u2019s wary of the drug use and he keeps an eye on more vulnerable users of the green space. \u201cI see a lot of suspicious activity. I don\u2019t really feel that safe sometimes with people walking up to your stuff. For the most part, people leave you alone, but you never know,\u201d Williams said.", "summary": "Seven people were arrested and face a total of 47 charges for drug trafficking, breaches of court-imposed conditions, fraud and weapons-related charges.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10595291/hot-spots-calgary-police-public-accessible/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rhys.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:11:26", "author": "Carolyn Kury de Castillo", "authors": ["Carolyn Kury de Castillo"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.131}

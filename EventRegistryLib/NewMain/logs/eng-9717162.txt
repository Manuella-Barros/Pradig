It has presented itself as a neutral party in the war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the US and other Western nations.\n\nBeijing, however, has offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nThe 32 NATO members, in their final communique on Wednesday, expressed \"profound concern\" over Beijing's deepening partnership with Moscow. They said China has \"become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called 'no limits' partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base\".\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbours and to Euro-Atlantic security,\" they said, urging China \"to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort\". Beijing \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation\", they added.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters that China provides equipment, microelectronics and tools that are allowing Russia \"to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine\".\n\nHe said it was the first time all NATO allies had stated this so clearly in an agreed document.\n\nBeijing's spokesperson dismissed the criticism, however, saying, \"As we all know, China is not the creator of the crisis in Ukraine.\"\n\n\"The declaration of the NATO summit in Washington is full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content is full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears,\" the official told reporters.\n\nThey added that China's core position is to \"promote peace talks and political settlement\", a reference to a 12-point peace plan Beijing issued more than a year ago that set out general principles for ending the war.\n\nThe plan received a lukewarm reception at the time in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nNATO member countries, in this year's declaration, also reiterated that China poses \"systemic challenges\" to Euro-Atlantic security, including by carrying out sustained, malicious online and hybrid activities, such as disinformation campaigns.\n\nThey also expressed concerns over China's space capabilities and activities, and raised alarms that Beijing is rapidly expanding and diversifying its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems.\n\nRachel Rizzo, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Europe Center, said NATO does not view China as a threat, but as a challenge.\n\nNATO has made it clear that the \"alliance discussing China is not about pushing the alliance into the Indo-Pacific region, rather it is about responding to China's political, economic inroads, technological in roads into Europe, as well as China buying up European infrastructure,\" Rizzo told Al Jazeera. \"So it's not about expanding the theatres of operations for NATO, but it's about responding to this very sort of meshed geographical theatre that we see around the globe now.\"\n\nThe NATO summit included leaders and deputies from the alliance's Asia Pacific partners, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. The Asian countries have forged stronger ties with NATO in recent years amid rising concerns over China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and the East China Sea.\n\nIn the final declaration, NATO members affirmed the importance of the Asia Pacific partners to the alliance and said they were \"strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges\".\n\nIt said NATO and the Asia Pacific partners plan to launch four projects to support Ukraine, bolster cooperation on cyber-defence, counter disinformation and work on artificial intelligence.\n\nThe NATO members said these projects would \"enhance our ability to work together on shared security interests\".", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Frontier Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They are partners, not members, of the alliance.\n\nIn the final declaration, NATO members affirmed the importance of the Indo-Pacific partners to the alliance and said they were \"strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges.\"\n\nNATO and the Indo-Pacific partners plan to launch four projects to support Ukraine, bolster cooperation on cyber defence, counter disinformation and work on artificial intelligence.

That includes the U.S., the Netherlands and Denmark announcing that the first NATO-provided F-16s would be in the hands of Ukrainian military pilots this summer.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted his appreciation of the effort to strengthen his air force, coming soon after Ukraine saw one of the deadliest strikes of the war.\n\nNATO on Wednesday also announced a long-term commitment of security assistance to Ukraine, and confirmed establishment of a new NATO center aimed at ensuring that Ukraine gets a more reliable flow of arms and training from members of the alliance. But the commitments still fall short of the striking power Ukraine says it needs to defeat the invading Russian forces.\n\nThe sternly worded final communiqu\u00e9 makes clear that China is becoming a focus of the military alliance. The European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China.\n\nBeijing insists that it does not provide military aid to Russia but has maintained strong trade ties with its northern neighbor throughout the conflict. It also accuses NATO of overreaching and inciting confrontation in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, NATO member countries said China has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" read the communiqu\u00e9, which referred to China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the document says.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said China provides equipment, microelectronics and tools that are \"enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said it was the first time all NATO allies have stated this so clearly in an agreed document.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington on Wednesday said China is neither a creator of nor a party to the Ukraine crisis. \"China does not provide weapons to the parties to the conflict and strictly controls the export of dual-use articles, which is widely applauded by the international community,\" said Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman.\n\nHe said China's normal trade with Russia is \"done aboveboard\" and \"beyond reproach.\"\n\n\"Ukraine's future is in NATO,\" alliance members said in their statement. \"We will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.\"\n\nThe alliance welcomed Ukraine's democratic, economic and security reforms needed to join and said it would get an invitation \"when Allies agree and conditions are met.\"\n\nNO THREAT TO RUSSIA\n\nWhile the leaders stand ready to offer Ukraine the means to defend itself in a war now in its third year, nowhere do they say that Ukraine should prevail over Russia. Indeed, their statement said that \"NATO does not seek confrontation, and poses no threat to Russia. We remain willing to maintain channels of communication with Moscow to mitigate risk and prevent escalation.\"\n\nStoltenberg underlined that Ukraine will not join the alliance's ranks immediately. But he insisted that must happen after the war is over to ensure that Russia never attacks Ukraine again.\n\nOf the overall NATO assistance, he said, \"We are not doing this because we want to prolong a war. We are doing it because we want to end a war as soon as possible.\"\n\nStoltenberg also delivered a passionate defense of the military alliance itself Wednesday when reporters asked about the possibility that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, a NATO critic, could pull U.S. support for the alliance if he wins in November.\n\nTrump has been an unofficial but primary topic at the summit, especially among East European governments that believe their countries could be targets of future Russian aggression.\n\nThe criticism of the alliance from the United States, Stoltenberg said, without naming Trump, has \"not been about NATO. It's about NATO allies not investing enough in NATO. And that has changed.\"\n\nAs NATO leaders met in Washington, Trump on the campaign trail Tuesday renewed his threat not to defend any NATO members from a Russian attack if their military spending does not meet NATO's target of at least 2% of their gross domestic product. But since 2021, the number of allies meeting this target has increased from six to 23.\n\n\"The United States has been understood,\" Stoltenberg said. \"Allies have acted.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, was asked several times on Fox News Radio whether he wants the U.S. to exit NATO. He answered, \"No, I want them to pay their bills.\"\n\nThe U.S. and some other countries have opposed membership for Ukraine during the conflict with Russia to avoid an escalation of tensions that could lead to a larger war. They also have stressed that Ukraine must take significant steps to address corruption as well as other systemic reforms.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has long bitterly opposed neighboring Ukraine's fight to join the Western alliance, declaring it an encroachment on Russia's security and interests.\n\n\"I think it's very important to give a message to the Kremlin from here -- that Ukraine's path and bridge towards NATO membership is now irreversible,\" Finnish President Alexander Stubb told reporters.\n\nPresident Joe Biden reaffirmed U.S. support for Ukraine but also more broadly the importance of NATO. He noted that since he took office not only has military spending increased but the number of battle groups has doubled on NATO's eastern flank.\n\n\"We can and will defend every inch of NATO territory, and we will do it together,\" Biden said.\n\nZelenskyy, in Washington for the NATO summit, had stressed what he called Ukraine's urgent need for the F-16 fighter jets in a speech to friendly Republican lawmakers Tuesday night. He said his country needed more than 100 to start to counter devastating Russian air attacks on Ukraine's cities, energy infrastructure and other vital targets. He said Russia was using 300 jets to carry out the attacks.\n\nF-16 TRAINING\n\nSix nations, including the United States, are training Ukrainians on the F-16s, but officials have not released precise numbers or all the locations.\n\nChief of Staff of the Air Force, Gen. David Allvin, just returned from Morris Air National Guard Base in Tucson, Ariz., where the U.S. training is taking place. Of the initial class of 12 Ukrainian pilots, seven completed training in May and the remaining five are expected to do so in August, Allvin said.\n\nThe pilots have learned to fly the fighter jet and will get follow-on training once they leave the U.S., but the value of getting Ukraine's F-16 program running is more about the longer term, he said. \"I don't know that it's realistic to assume that it's going to be a game-changer on the battlefield right now,\" Allvin said.\n\nThe first American-made F-16 fighter jets committed to Ukraine are also being transferred and are expected to take to the skies this summer, U.S. and European officials announced Wednesday.\n\nAn unspecified number of aircraft are en route from the Netherlands and Denmark, the nations' leaders said in a joint statement with President Biden. The statement noted that the governments of Belgium and Norway have committed to donate others.\n\nUkraine is expected to field 60 F-16s eventually, officials have said, with a host of nations banding together to provide pilot training, weapons and logistical support.\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, met behind closed doors with senators for nearly an hour Wednesday and requested more defense help, said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. Zelenskyy also met with the Republican speaker of the House.\n\nMISSILES FOR EUROPE\n\nSeparately Wednesday, the U.S. and Germany announced they would begin \"episodic deployments\" of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026, including Tomahawk, SM-6 and hypersonic missiles.\n\nThe announcement is notable because land-based firing of some of those missiles from within Europe would have been banned under the former Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. They were banned because the conventional missiles could have been modified to be nuclear capable and their use on the European continent would have meant that potential targets would have had no time to react.\n\nKimball said while the deployment is likely being done to reassure allies, Russia may respond by deploying conventional or nuclear weapons of its own.\n\nEuropean and U.S. allies have announced other new arms deliveries, such as dozens of air defense systems, including Patriots, this week.\n\nThe promises of new weapons come after opposition from Republican lawmakers allied to Trump blocked a U.S. support package to Ukraine for months earlier this year, allowing Russia to make battlefield gains against Ukrainian forces who were fighting with dwindling arms and ammunition.\n\nEuropeans and NATO, as a lesson from that setback, have vowed to take on more of the responsibility for ensuring a reliable flow of military support to Ukraine.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Ellen Knickmeyer, Lorne Cook, Tara Copp, Lolita C.

The European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China.\n\nBeijing insists that it does not provide military aid to Russia but has maintained strong trade ties with its northern neighbor throughout the conflict. It also accuses NATO of overreaching and inciting confrontation in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, NATO member countries said China has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security.

The European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China.\n\nBeijing insists that it does not provide military aid to Russia but has maintained strong trade ties with its northern neighbor throughout the conflict. It also accuses NATO of overreaching and inciting confrontation in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, NATO member countries said China has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" read the communiqu\u00e9, which referred to China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the document says.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said China provides equipment, microelectronics and tools that are \"enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said it was the first time all NATO allies have stated this so clearly in an agreed document.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington on Wednesday said China is neither a creator of nor a party to the Ukraine crisis. \"China does not provide weapons to the parties to the conflict and strictly controls the export of dual-use articles, which is widely applauded by the international community,\" said Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman.\n\nHe said China's normal trade with Russia is \"done aboveboard\" and \"beyond reproach.\"\n\nDanny Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for Asia, called the new wording by NATO \"an extraordinary step,\" particularly because it was coupled with the warning that Beijing continues to pose \"systemic challenges\" to European interests and security.\n\n\"It is a mark of how badly Beijing's attempt to straddle Russia and Western Europe has failed and how hollow its claim of neutrality rings,\" said Russel, who is vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"China's attempts at divide-and-conquer have instead produced remarkable solidarity between key nations of the Euro-Atlantic and the Asia-Pacific regions.\"\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the statement is \"highly significant\" because it signals to China that Europe, just like the U.S., also condemns support to Russia.\n\n\"The U.S. believes that Europe has influence in Beijing, and that while China will not pay any attention to U.S. condemnation, they will pay attention to European condemnation because just because Europe trades with China, China also trades with Europe,\" Bergmann said.\n\nIn this year's final declaration, NATO member countries reiterated their concerns that China poses \"systemic challenges\" to Euro-Atlantic security. It was first raised in 2021.\n\nThe alliance said China has been behind sustained, malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation and expressed concerns over China's space capabilities and activities. It also raised alarms that China is rapidly expanding and diversifying its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems.\n\nLiu, the Chinese embassy spokesman, said China handles such issues \"in a responsible manner with transparent policies.\"\n\n\"Hyping up the so-called 'China threat' is completely futile,\" Liu said, adding Beijing firmly opposes NATO's use of regional hotspot issues to smear China and incite a new Cold War.\n\nIn Washington, where leaders of NATO nations are convening this week to mark the coalition's 75th anniversary, President Joe Biden said the alliance must not fall behind Russia, which is ramping up weapon production with the help of China, North Korea and Iran.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea have sent their leaders or deputies to the NATO summit in Washington this week. They are partners, not members, of the alliance.\n\nIn the final declaration, NATO members affirmed the importance of the Indo-Pacific partners to the alliance and said they were \"strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges.\"\n\nNATO and the Indo-Pacific partners plan to launch four projects to support Ukraine, bolster cooperation on cyber defense, counter disinformation and work on artificial intelligence. The NATO members said these projects would \"enhance our ability to work together on shared security interests.\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley

The European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China.\n\nBeijing insists that it does not provide military aid to Russia but has maintained strong trade ties with its northern neighbor throughout the conflict. It also accuses NATO of overreaching and inciting confrontation in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, NATO member countries said China has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" read the communiqu\u00e9, which referred to China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the document says.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said China provides equipment, microelectronics and tools that are \"enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said it was the first time all NATO allies have stated this so clearly in an agreed document.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington on Wednesday said China is neither a creator of nor a party to the Ukraine crisis. \"China does not provide weapons to the parties to the conflict and strictly controls the export of dual-use articles, which is widely applauded by the international community,\" said Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman.\n\nHe said China's normal trade with Russia is \"done aboveboard\" and \"beyond reproach.\"\n\nDanny Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for Asia, called the new wording by NATO \"an extraordinary step,\" particularly because it was coupled with the warning that Beijing continues to pose \"systemic challenges\" to European interests and security.\n\n\"It is a mark of how badly Beijing's attempt to straddle Russia and Western Europe has failed and how hollow its claim of neutrality rings,\" said Russel, who is vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"China's attempts at divide-and-conquer have instead produced remarkable solidarity between key nations of the Euro-Atlantic and the Asia-Pacific regions.\"\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the statement is \"highly significant\" because it signals to China that Europe, just like the U.S., also condemns support to Russia.\n\n\"The U.S. believes that Europe has influence in Beijing, and that while China will not pay any attention to U.S. condemnation, they will pay attention to European condemnation because just because Europe trades with China, China also trades with Europe,\" Bergmann said.\n\nIn this year's final declaration, NATO member countries reiterated their concerns that China poses \"systemic challenges\" to Euro-Atlantic security. It was first raised in 2021.\n\nThe alliance said China has been behind sustained, malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation and expressed concerns over China's space capabilities and activities. It also raised alarms that China is rapidly expanding and diversifying its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems.\n\nLiu, the Chinese embassy spokesman, said China handles such issues \"in a responsible manner with transparent policies.\"\n\n\"Hyping up the so-called 'China threat' is completely futile,\" Liu said, adding Beijing firmly opposes NATO's use of regional hotspot issues to smear China and incite a new Cold War.\n\nIn Washington, where leaders of NATO nations are convening this week to mark the coalition's 75th anniversary, President Joe Biden said the alliance must not fall behind Russia, which is ramping up weapon production with the help of China, North Korea and Iran.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea have sent their leaders or deputies to the NATO summit in Washington this week. They are partners, not members, of the alliance.\n\nIn the final declaration, NATO members affirmed the importance of the Indo-Pacific partners to the alliance and said they were \"strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges.\"\n\nNATO and the Indo-Pacific partners plan to launch four projects to support Ukraine, bolster cooperation on cyber defense, counter disinformation and work on artificial intelligence. The NATO members said these projects would \"enhance our ability to work together on shared security interests.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nKickstarter Fundraising for Jig App: Unique Experiences

Washington Convention Center, U.S. President Joe Biden said that Russia was on a \"wartime footing\" and looking to its authoritarian allies to provide resources for its war in Ukraine.\n\n\"They're significantly ramping up their production of weapons, munitions and vehicles, and they're doing it with the help of China, North Korea and Iran,\" Biden said at the opening, calling on the NATO members to similarly increase defense spending to keep up.\n\n\"We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind,\" he said, before asking the gathered press to leave the room so the summit could start.\n\nIn a joint statement later issued by the 32 NATO member states, the alliance called for Beijing to stop enabling Moscow's invasion of Ukraine by providing the inputs its military needs to produce weapons and hardware amid otherwise tight U.S.-led trade sanctions.\n\n\"The PRC has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called no-limits partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base,\" the NATO statement says, using an acronym for the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbours and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort.\"\n\nThe statement also promises the establishment of a joint NATO training center in Poland, which also shares its eastern border with Ukraine.\n\nIt's not the first time accusations about Chinese support for Russia's military industrial base have been made by NATO countries.\n\nAhead of a trip to Beijing in April, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused China of \"fueling\" the war in Ukraine through a \"supply of inputs\" required by Russia's defense industry, such as machine tools, microchips and dual-use goods with military uses.\n\nAt a panel event at the summit on Wednesday, Blinken put precise numbers on the claim, saying \"70% of the machine tools\" and \"90% of the microelectronics\" arriving in Russia were coming from China.\n\n\"We've seen a massive buildup of its weaponry over the last year and a half - tanks, missiles, munitions,\" he said. \"That's the product of a defense industrial base being fueled by China. As a result, European allies understand the challenge posed by China to Europe's security.\"\n\nChina, for its part, has not denied the claims, but has insisted it \"has every right to normal economic and trade cooperation\" with Russia.\n\nDrills in Belarus\n\nAt a press briefing in Beijing earlier Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian appealed for NATO to stay in its lane as an alliance between Europe and North American countries.\n\n\"China's position on NATO is consistent,\" Lin said. \"We firmly oppose NATO acting beyond its characterization as a regional defensive alliance, inserting itself into the Asia-Pacific to incite confrontation and rivalry, and disrupting the prosperity and stability in this region.\"\n\nLin also denied that China's ongoing military training with Russia's military in Belarus was related to the NATO summit, saying it was part of a deal inked last week when Belarus became the latest member of a Central Asia-focussed regional group led by Russia and Beijing.\n\n\"The joint army training is part of the annual cooperation plan between China and Belarus,\" he said. \"It is normal military exchange and cooperation between China and Belarus and within international law and common practices, and it's not directed at any particular country.\"\n\nYet against Beijing's appeals for NATO to keep its focus solely on the Atlantic, the pact's leaders have welcomed allies across Asia and the Pacific as observers this year, noting Russia's expansion of its footprint through a reliance on China and North Korea to supply its war effort.\n\nAttending this year's summit are Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who are each attending for the third year in a row, as well as Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles.\n\n'A stake in our success'\n\nNATO leaders have been unapologetic about expanding the alliance's footprint to Asia by including longtime Western allies at summits.\n\nAt the opening of the summit on Tuesday night, Biden had said NATO had become history's most successful military alliance because it had always adapted to the times since its founding with 12 members.\n\n\"We did [adapt], evolving our strategy to stay ahead of threats, reaching out to new partners to increase our effectiveness,\" Biden said, pointing to non-NATO observers at the summit. \"Here with us today are countries from the Indo-Pacific region. They're here because they have a stake in our success, and we have a stake in theirs.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also noted how Russia's invasion of Ukraine is tying together continents and giving allies outside of Europe and North America a stake in NATO's affairs.\n\n\"Our security is interlinked because Iran, North Korea and China are the main enablers of Russia's war against Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg told reporters as he arrived at the summit Wednesday morning.\n\nAt a panel event at the summit hosted by Atlantic Council CEO Frederick Kempe, Stoltenberg said that Iran and North Korea's help to Russia was important but was dwarfed by China's support.\n\n\"China is the main enabler,\" Stoltenberg told the panel. \"They are delivering the tools, the dual-use equipment, the microelectronics, everything Russia needs to build the missiles, the bombs, the aircrafts, and all the other systems that they use against Ukraine.\"\n\nAn inflection in Europe-China ties could soon arrive, he added.\n\n\"If China continues, they cannot have it both ways,\" he said. \"They cannot ... have a kind of normal relationship with NATO allies in North America and Europe, and then fuel a war in Europe that constitutes the biggest challenge to our security since the Second World War.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_pike@globalsecurity.org", "name": "John Pike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member states of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_E._Washington_Convention_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walter E.

A statement from the Foreign Ministry told NATO to not bring the same \"chaos\" to Asia following the strongly-worded Washington Declaration calling on Beijing to stop aiding Moscow's war effort.\n\n\"NATO agitating about China's responsibility on the Ukraine issue is unreasonable and has sinister motives,\" spokesperson Lin Jian said at a daily briefing on Thursday, maintaining that China has a fair and objective stance on the Ukraine issue. \"China urges NATO to ... stop interfering in China's internal politics and smearing China's image and not create chaos in the Asia-Pacific after creating turmoil in Europe,\" he said.\n\nAllies of NATO, who are currently in Washington to celebrate the alliance's 75th anniversary, made their sharpest rebuke of China by expressing concerns over its deepening ties with Russia, calling Beijing a \"decisive enabler\" of Moscow's war in Ukraine. The final communique made it clear that China was becoming a focus of the military alliance due to its rising nuclear arsenal and its capabilities in space.\n\nBeijing has denied that it supports Russia's war efforts and insists that it conducts normal trade with its northern neighbour. However, relations between Moscow and Beijing are at their highest, as China has strengthened its trade and military ties with Russia in recent years, supplying machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without actually exporting weaponry. China has also backed Russia's contention that NATO expansion posed a threat to Russia.\n\nIn the communique, NATO member countries said China has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base. It called on China to cease all material and political support for Russia's war effort.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbours and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" read the communique, which referred to China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"The deepening strategic partnership between Russia and the PRC and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order, are a cause for profound concern. We are confronted by hybrid, cyber, space, and other threats and malicious activities from state and non-state actors,\" further read the declaration.\n\n\"We urge NATO to reflect on the root cause of the crisis and what it has done, and take concrete action to de-escalate rather than shift blame,\" Lin said at the briefing. His comments follow remarks from a spokesperson for the Chinese mission to the European Union who described the draft as \"full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears.\"\n\nThe 32 members of NATO also formally declared Ukraine on an \"irreversible\" path to membership in the Western military alliance, offering a bare but more binding assurance of protection once its war with Russia ends. It also announced a long-term commitment of security assistance to Ukraine, although they still fell short of the firepower Kyiv needs to deter Russian forces.\n\nNATO also condemned Russia's \"irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and coercive nuclear signalling, including its announced stationing of nuclear weapons in Belarus,\" adding that Minsk continues to enable Russia's war in Ukraine. However, allies remain willing to maintain channels of communication with Moscow to \"mitigate risk and prevent escalation.\"\n\nThe declaration says the alliance will continue to support Ukraine \"on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership\" as Kyiv continues the \"vital work\" of democratic, economic and security reforms. It reaffirms that NATO will \"be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met.\"\n\nPreviously, Beijing has expressed displeasure at NATO's growing interest in Asia and demanded the alliance stay out of the Asia-Pacific region and not incite confrontation. \"NATO should not use China to justify its insertion into the Asia-Pacific and attempt to disrupt regional dynamics,\" said Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, on Tuesday.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType":

Washington is trying to curb Beijing's ambition to challenge the U.S.-led world order, which the Chinese government dismisses as a Cold War mentality aimed at containing China's inevitable rise.\n\nOn Monday, Beijing responded angrily to unconfirmed reports that NATO and its four Indo-Pacific partners are expected to release a document laying out their relationship and ability to respond jointly to threats from cyberattacks and disinformation.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, accused NATO of \"breaching its boundary, expanding its mandate, reaching beyond its defense zone and stoking confrontation.\"\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which has pitted the West against Russia and its friends, has bolstered the argument for closer cooperation between the U.S., Europe and their Asian allies. \"Ukraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow,\" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the U.S. Congress in April.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with ammunition, while Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea last month and signed a pact with leader Kim Jong Un that envisions mutual military assistance.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan, meanwhile, are sending military supplies and aid to Ukraine.

The European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China.\n\nThe Chinese regime insists that it does not provide military aid to Russia but has maintained strong trade ties with its northern neighbor throughout the conflict. It also accuses NATO of overreaching and inciting confrontation in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, NATO member countries said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" read the communiqu\u00e9, which referred to China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the document says.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said China provides equipment, microelectronics and tools that are \"enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said it was the first time all NATO allies have stated this so clearly in an agreed document.\n\nDanny Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for Asia, called the new wording by NATO \"an extraordinary step,\" particularly because it was coupled with the warning that the CCP continues to pose \"systemic challenges\" to European interests and security.\n\n\"It is a mark of how badly Beijing's attempt to straddle Russia and Western Europe has failed and how hollow its claim of neutrality rings,\" said Mr. Russel, who is vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"China's attempts at divide-and-conquer have instead produced remarkable solidarity between key nations of the Euro-Atlantic and the Asia-Pacific regions.\"\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the statement is \"highly significant\" because it signals to China that Europe, just like the United States, also condemns support to Russia.\n\n\"The U.S. believes that Europe has influence in Beijing, and that while China will not pay any attention to U.S. condemnation, they will pay attention to European condemnation because just because Europe trades with China, China also trades with Europe,\" Bergmann said.\n\nIn this year's final declaration, NATO member countries reiterated their concerns that China poses \"systemic challenges\" to Euro-Atlantic security. It was first raised in 2021.\n\nThe alliance said China has been behind sustained, malicious cyber, and hybrid activities, including disinformation and expressed concerns over the CCP's space capabilities and activities. It also raised alarms that the CCP is rapidly expanding and diversifying its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems.\n\nIn Washington, where leaders of NATO nations are convening this week to mark the coalition's 75th anniversary, President Joe Biden said the alliance must not fall behind Russia, which is ramping up weapon production with the help of China, North Korea, and Iran.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea have sent their leaders or deputies to the NATO summit in Washington this week. They are partners, not members, of the alliance.\n\nIn the final declaration, NATO members affirmed the importance of the Indo-Pacific partners to the alliance and said they were \"strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges.\"\n\nNATO and the Indo-Pacific partners plan to launch four projects to support Ukraine, bolster cooperation on cyber defense, counter disinformation and work on artificial intelligence. The NATO members said these projects would \"enhance our ability to work together on shared security interests.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [],

It has presented itself as a neutral party in the war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the US and other Western nations.\n\nBeijing, however, has offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nThe 32 NATO members, in their final communique on Wednesday, expressed \"profound concern\" over Beijing's deepening partnership with Moscow. They said China has \"become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called 'no limits' partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base\".\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbours and to Euro-Atlantic security,\" they said, urging China \"to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort\". Beijing \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation\", they added.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters that China provides equipment, microelectronics and tools that are allowing Russia \"to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine\".\n\nHe said it was the first time all NATO allies had stated this so clearly in an agreed document.\n\nBeijing's spokesperson dismissed the criticism, however, saying, \"As we all know, China is not the creator of the crisis in Ukraine.\"\n\n\"The declaration of the NATO summit in Washington is full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content is full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears,\" the official told reporters.\n\nThey added that China's core position is to \"promote peace talks and political settlement\", a reference to a 12-point peace plan Beijing issued more than a year ago that set out general principles for ending the war.", "source": {"uri": "suchtv.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "SUCH TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member states of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary General of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.suchtv.pk/media/k2/items/cache/7c4f00e2c5135669a123a8e5246182dd_XL.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717162", "eventUri": "eng-9717162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

China will be following the summit closely, worried by the alliance's growing interest beyond Europe and the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\"Increasingly, partners in Europe see challenges halfway around the world in Asia as being relevant to them, just as partners in Asia see challenges halfway around the world in Europe as being relevant to them,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week at the Brookings Institution.\n\nAmerica's top diplomat said the U.S. has been working to break down barriers between European alliances, Asian coalitions and other partners worldwide. \"That's part of the new landscape, the new geometry that we've put in place.\"\n\nCountries with shared security concerns are strengthening ties as competition escalates between the United States and China. Washington is trying to curb Beijing's ambition to challenge the U.S.-led world order, which the Chinese government dismisses as a Cold War mentality aimed at containing China's inevitable rise.\n\nOn Monday, Beijing responded angrily to unconfirmed reports that NATO and its four Indo-Pacific partners are expected to release a document laying out their relationship and ability to respond jointly to threats from cyberattacks and disinformation.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, accused NATO of \"breaching its boundary, expanding its mandate, reaching beyond its defense zone and stoking confrontation.\"\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which has pitted the West against Russia and its friends, has bolstered the argument for closer cooperation between the U.S., Europe and their Asian allies. \"Ukraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow,\" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the U.S. Congress in April.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with ammunition, while Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea last month and signed a pact with leader Kim Jong Un that envisions mutual military assistance.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan, meanwhile, are sending military supplies and aid to Ukraine. The U.S. also says China is providing Russia with machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that allow it to make weapons to use against Ukraine.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will bring to Washington \"a strong message regarding the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea and discuss ways to enhance cooperation among NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners,\" his principal deputy national security adviser, Kim Tae-hyo, told reporters Friday.\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said discussions would \"focus on our collective efforts to support the rules-based system.\"\n\nThe partnership does not make NATO a direct player in the Indo-Pacific but allows it to coordinate with the four partners on issues of mutual concern, said Mirna Galic, senior policy analyst on China and East Asia at the U.S. Institute of Peace. For example, she wrote in an analysis, they can share information and align on actions such as sanctions and aid delivery but do not intervene in military crises outside of their own regions.\n\nThe NATO summit will allow the United States and its European and Indo-Pacific allies to push back against China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, according to Luis Simon, director of the Centre for Security Diplomacy and Strategy at Vrije Universiteit Brussel.\n\n\"The fact that the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific alliances are structured around a clear anchor -- U.S. military power -- makes them more cohesive and gives them a strategic edge as compared to the sort of interlocking partnerships that bind China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea,\" Simon wrote in a commentary last week on War On the Rocks, a defense and foreign affairs website.\n\nBeijing is worried by NATO's pivot to the east, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in eastern China. Beijing has insisted that NATO not interfere in security affairs in the Indo-Pacific and that it should change its view of China as a strategic adversary.\n\n\"NATO should consider China as a positive force for the regional peace and stability and for global security,\" Zhu said. \"We also hope the Ukraine war can end as soon as possible ... and we have rejected a return to the triangular relation with Russia and North Korea.\"\n\n\"In today's volatile and fragile world, Europe, the U.S. and China should strengthen global and regional cooperation,\" Zhu said.\n\nNATO and China had little conflict until tensions grew between Beijing and Washington in 2019, the same year the NATO summit in London raised China as a \"challenge\" that \"we need to address together as an alliance.\" Two years later, NATO upgraded China to a \"systemic challenge\" and said Beijing was \"cooperating militarily with Russia.\"\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand attended a NATO summit for the first time, where statements noted the geopolitical challenges China poses. Beijing accused NATO of \"cooperating with the U.S. government for an all-around suppression of China.\"\n\nNow, Beijing is worried that Washington is forming a NATO-like alliance in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nChinese Senior Col. Cao Yanzhong, a researcher at China's Institute of War Studies, asked U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last month whether the U.S. was trying to create an Asian version of NATO by emphasizing partnerships and alliances. They include a U.S. grouping with Britain and Australia; another with Australia, India and Japan; and one with Japan and South Korea.\n\n\"What implications do you think the strengthening of the U.S. alliance system in the Asia-Pacific will have on this region's security and stability?\" Cao asked at the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore.\n\nAustin replied that the U.S. was simply working with \"like-minded countries with similar values and a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nBeijing has its own conclusion.\n\n\"The real intent of the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy is to integrate all small circles into a big circle as the Asian version of NATO in order to maintain the hegemony as led by the United States,\" Chinese Lt.

China will be following the summit closely, worried by the alliance's growing interest beyond Europe and the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\"Increasingly, partners in Europe see challenges halfway around the world in Asia as being relevant to them, just as partners in Asia see challenges halfway around the world in Europe as being relevant to them,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week at the Brookings Institution.\n\nAmerica's top diplomat said the US has been working to break down barriers between European alliances, Asian coalitions and other partners worldwide. \"That's part of the new landscape, the new geometry that we've put in place.\"\n\nCountries with shared security concerns are strengthening ties as competition escalates between the United States and China. Washington is trying to curb Beijing's ambition to challenge the US-led world order, which the Chinese government dismisses as a Cold War mentality aimed at containing China's inevitable rise.\n\nOn Monday, Beijing responded angrily to unconfirmed reports that NATO and its four Indo-Pacific partners are expected to release a document laying out their relationship and ability to respond jointly to threats from cyberattacks and disinformation.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, accused NATO of \"breaching its boundary, expanding its mandate, reaching beyond its defence zone and stoking confrontation\".\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which has pitted the West against Russia and its friends, has bolstered the argument for closer cooperation between the US, Europe and their Asian allies. \"Ukraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow,\" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the US Congress in April.\n\nThe US and South Korea accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with ammunition, while Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea last month and signed a pact with leader Kim Jong Un that envisions mutual military assistance.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan, meanwhile, are sending military supplies and aid to Ukraine. The US also says China is providing Russia with machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that allow it to make weapons to use against Ukraine.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will bring to Washington \"a strong message regarding the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea and discuss ways to enhance cooperation among NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners\", his principal deputy national security adviser, Kim Tae-hyo, told reporters on Friday.\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said discussions would \"focus on our collective efforts to support the rules-based system\".\n\nThe partnership does not make NATO a direct player in the Indo-Pacific but allows it to coordinate with the four partners on issues of mutual concern, said Mirna Galic, senior policy analyst on China and East Asia at the US Institute of Peace. For example, she wrote in an analysis, they can share information and align on actions such as sanctions and aid delivery but do not intervene in military crises outside of their own regions.\n\nThe NATO summit will allow the United States and its European and Indo-Pacific allies to push back against China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, according to Luis Simon, director of the Centre for Security Diplomacy and Strategy at Vrije Universiteit Brussel.\n\n\"The fact that the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific alliances are structured around a clear anchor -- US military power -- makes them more cohesive and gives them a strategic edge as compared to the sort of interlocking partnerships that bind China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea,\" Simon wrote in a commentary last week on War On the Rocks, a defence and foreign affairs website.\n\nBeijing is worried by NATO's pivot to the east, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in eastern China. Beijing has insisted that NATO not interfere in security affairs in the Indo-Pacific and that it should change its view of China as a strategic adversary.\n\n\"NATO should consider China as a positive force for the regional peace and stability and for global security,\" Zhu said. \"We also hope the Ukraine war can end as soon as possible ... and we have rejected a return to the triangular relation with Russia and North Korea.\"\n\n\"In today's volatile and fragile world, Europe, the US and China should strengthen global and regional cooperation,\" Zhu said.\n\nNATO and China had little conflict until tensions grew between Beijing and Washington in 2019, the same year the NATO summit in London raised China as a \"challenge\" that \"we need to address together as an alliance\".\n\nTwo years later, NATO upgraded China to a \"systemic challenge\" and said Beijing was \"cooperating militarily with Russia\".\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand attended a NATO summit for the first time, where statements noted the geopolitical challenges China poses. Beijing accused NATO of \"cooperating with the US government for an all-around suppression of China\".\n\nNow, Beijing is worried that Washington is forming a NATO-like alliance in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nChinese Senior Col. Cao Yanzhong, a researcher at China's Institute of War Studies, asked US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin last month whether the US was trying to create an Asian version of NATO by emphasising partnerships and alliances.\n\nThey include a US grouping with Britain and Australia; another with Australia, India and Japan; and one with Japan and South Korea.\n\n\"What implications do you think the strengthening of the US alliance system in the Asia-Pacific will have on this region's security and stability?\" Cao asked at the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore.\n\nAustin replied that the US was simply working with \"like-minded countries with similar values and a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific\".\n\nBeijing has its own conclusion.\n\n\"The real intent of the US Indo-Pacific strategy is to integrate all small circles into a big circle as the Asian version of NATO in order to maintain the hegemony as led by the United States,\" Chinese Lt.

Washington is trying to curb Beijing's ambition to challenge the US-led world order, which the Chinese government dismisses as a Cold War mentality aimed at containing China's inevitable rise.\n\nOn Monday, Beijing responded angrily to unconfirmed reports that NATO and its four Indo-Pacific partners are expected to release a document laying out their relationship and ability to respond jointly to threats from cyberattacks and disinformation.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, accused NATO of \"breaching its boundary, expanding its mandate, reaching beyond its defense zone and stoking confrontation.\"\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which has pitted the West against Russia and its friends, has bolstered the argument for closer cooperation between the US, Europe and their Asian allies. \"Ukraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow,\" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the US Congress in April.\n\nThe US and South Korea accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with ammunition, while Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea last month and signed a pact with leader Kim Jong Un that envisions mutual military assistance.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan, meanwhile, are sending military supplies and aid to Ukraine.

For example, she wrote in an analysis, they can share information and align on actions such as sanctions and aid delivery but do not intervene in military crises outside of their own regions.\n\nThe NATO summit will allow the United States and its European and Indo-Pacific allies to push back against China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, according to Luis Simon, director of the Centre for Security Diplomacy and Strategy at Vrije Universiteit Brussel.\n\n\"The fact that the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific alliances are structured around a clear anchor -- US military power -- makes them more cohesive and gives them a strategic edge as compared to the sort of interlocking partnerships that bind China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea,\" Simon wrote in a commentary last week on War On the Rocks, a defense and foreign affairs website.\n\nBeijing is worried by NATO's pivot to the east, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in eastern China. Beijing has insisted that NATO not interfere in security affairs in the Indo-Pacific and that it should change its view of China as a strategic adversary.\n\n\"NATO should consider China as a positive force for the regional peace and stability and for global security,\" Zhu said. \"We also hope the Ukraine war can end as soon as possible...and we have rejected a return to the triangular relation with Russia and North Korea.\"\n\n\"In today's volatile and fragile world, Europe, the US and China should strengthen global and regional cooperation,\" Zhu said.\n\nNATO and China had little conflict until tensions grew between Beijing and Washington in 2019, the same year the NATO summit in London raised China as a \"challenge\" that \"we need to address together as an alliance.\" Two years later, NATO upgraded China to a \"systemic challenge\" and said Beijing was \"cooperating militarily with Russia.\"\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand attended a NATO summit for the first time, where statements noted the geopolitical challenges China poses. Beijing accused NATO of \"cooperating with the US government for an all-around suppression of China.\"\n\nNow, Beijing is worried that Washington is forming a NATO-like alliance in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nChinese Senior Col. Cao Yanzhong, a researcher at China's Institute of War Studies, asked US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last month whether the US was trying to create an Asian version of NATO by emphasizing partnerships and alliances. They include a US grouping with Britain and Australia; another with Australia, India and Japan; and one with Japan and South Korea.\n\n\"What implications do you think the strengthening of the US alliance system in the Asia-Pacific will have on this region's security and stability?\" Cao asked at the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore.\n\nAustin replied that the US was simply working with \"like-minded countries with similar values and a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nBeijing has its own conclusion.\n\n\"The real intent of the US Indo-Pacific strategy is to integrate all small circles into a big circle as the Asian version of NATO in order to maintain the hegemony as led by the United States,\" Chinese Lt.

Its European allies, most of whom are far more economically reliant on Beijing than Washington is, have been more hesitant to make that call.\n\nThis week's communique, however, means that NATO as a whole has come into line with Washington's view.\n\n\"Authoritarian leaders in Iran, North Korea and China all support Russia's brutal war,\" Stoltenberg said in a speech Tuesday opening the summit. \"They all want NATO to fail, so the outcome of this war will shape global security for decades to come.\"\n\nFabrice Pothier, former head of policy planning for two NATO secretaries-general, told NBC News that the communique represented a \"sharpening\" of the alliance's previous criticism of China. \"But the tension within NATO\" remains, he added, in that \"it falls short of putting a cost or pointing to any consequences in that behavior\" by China.\n\nThere are other signs that some of the alliance's members are increasingly of the view that -- although it falls outside their Russia-focused remit -- China is inextricably related to their mission because of its relationship with the Kremlin.\n\nCzech President Petr Pavel warned the summit that Russian victory in Ukraine would \"encourage China to be more assertive and aggressive.\" He urged NATO members to support America in its \"competition with China in all areas around the globe.\"\n\nAlongside the NATO members themselves, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea were all at the summit to \"discuss the increasing connectivity\" between Europe and Asia, a White House briefing note said. Most pressing is the \"increasingly concerning military and economic relationship\" among China, Russia and North Korea, the note added.\n\nBeijing and Moscow have grown increasingly close in recent years, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin declaring a \"no-limits partnership\" days after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. China claims that it takes a neutral position on the conflict, blaming the U.S. and NATO for provoking the invasion by ignoring Russia's concerns about the alliance's expansion.\n\nThe alliance has morphed in focus since 1949, when it was founded as a military and political bulwark against the then-Soviet Union. After that communist empire collapsed in 1991, NATO's widening purview has had mixed results.\n\nIn 2003, its leading role in Afghanistan after the U.S.-led invasion was its first foray outside Europe. Afghanistan descended into a quagmire of bloody insurgency and government corruption, before the Taliban took back control of the country in 2021.\n\nA more successful example was in the former Yugoslavia, where NATO carried out a 78-day bombing campaign to stop the Serbian government of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, which was committing atrocities in Kosovo.\n\nToday, any expansion into Asia is still being debated within NATO.\n\nSome allies, including Sweden, have even floated opening a liaison office in Tokyo. But French President Emmanuel Macron said in June last year that such a geographic expansion outside NATO's backyard would be a \"big mistake.\"\n\nFor Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, the communique was not \"an indication of NATO pivoting toward Asia, but rather dealing with problems that China is causing within its own vicinity,\"\n\nHe added that it left \"a lot of open questions, however, such as now there's language recognizing China as a problem, what are the 32 members of NATO going to do to deal with that problem?\"", "source":

China will be following the summit closely, worried by the alliance's growing interest beyond Europe and the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\"Increasingly, partners in Europe see challenges halfway around the world in Asia as being relevant to them, just as partners in Asia see challenges halfway around the world in Europe as being relevant to them,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week at the Brookings Institution.\n\nAmerica's top diplomat said the U.S. has been working to break down barriers between European alliances, Asian coalitions and other partners worldwide. \"That's part of the new landscape, the new geometry that we've put in place.\"\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday that NATO allies and the Indo-Pacific partners will launch four new joint projects, which will be on Ukraine, artificial intelligence, disinformation and cybersecurity.\n\n\"Each initiative is different, but the main goal is the same: harness the unique strengths of highly capable democracies to address shared challenges,\" Sullivan said at a defense industry forum.\n\nCountries with shared security concerns are strengthening ties as competition escalates between the United States and China. Washington is trying to curb Beijing's ambition to challenge the U.S.-led world order, which the Chinese government dismisses as a Cold War mentality aimed at containing China's inevitable rise.\n\nBeijing has responded angrily to the prospect of NATO and its four Indo-Pacific partners deepening their cooperation.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, on Monday accused NATO of \"breaching its boundary, expanding its mandate, reaching beyond its defense zone and stoking confrontation.\"\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which has pitted the West against Russia and its friends, has bolstered the argument for closer cooperation between the U.S., Europe and their Asian allies. \"Ukraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow,\" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the U.S. Congress in April.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with ammunition, while Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea last month and signed a pact with leader Kim Jong Un that envisions mutual military assistance.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan, meanwhile, are sending military supplies and aid to Ukraine. The U.S. also says China is providing Russia with machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that allow it to make weapons to use against Ukraine.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol will bring to Washington \"a strong message regarding the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea and discuss ways to enhance cooperation among NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners,\" his principal deputy national security adviser, Kim Tae-hyo, told reporters Friday.\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said discussions would \"focus on our collective efforts to support the rules-based system.\"\n\nThe partnership does not make NATO a direct player in the Indo-Pacific but allows it to coordinate with the four partners on issues of mutual concern, said Mirna Galic, senior policy analyst on China and East Asia at the U.S. Institute of Peace. For example, she wrote in an analysis, they can share information and align on actions such as sanctions and aid delivery but do not intervene in military crises outside of their own regions.\n\nThe NATO summit will allow the United States and its European and Indo-Pacific allies to push back against China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, according to Luis Simon, director of the Centre for Security Diplomacy and Strategy at Vrije Universiteit Brussel.\n\n\"The fact that the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific alliances are structured around a clear anchor -- U.S. military power -- makes them more cohesive and gives them a strategic edge as compared to the sort of interlocking partnerships that bind China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea,\" Simon wrote in a commentary last week on War On the Rocks, a defense and foreign affairs website.\n\nBeijing is worried by NATO's pivot to the east, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in eastern China. Beijing has insisted that NATO not interfere in security affairs in the Indo-Pacific and that it should change its view of China as a strategic adversary.\n\n\"NATO should consider China as a positive force for the regional peace and stability and for global security,\" Zhu said. \"We also hope the Ukraine war can end as soon as possible ... and we have rejected a return to the triangular relation with Russia and North Korea.\"\n\n\"In today's volatile and fragile world, Europe, the U.S. and China should strengthen global and regional cooperation,\" Zhu said.\n\nNATO and China had little conflict until tensions grew between Beijing and Washington in 2019, the same year the NATO summit in London raised China as a \"challenge\" that \"we need to address together as an alliance.\" Two years later, NATO upgraded China to a \"systemic challenge\" and said Beijing was \"cooperating militarily with Russia.\"\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand attended a NATO summit for the first time, where statements noted the geopolitical challenges China poses. Beijing accused NATO of \"cooperating with the U.S. government for an all-around suppression of China.\"\n\nNow, Beijing is worried that Washington is forming a NATO-like alliance in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nChinese Senior Col. Cao Yanzhong, a researcher at China's Institute of War Studies, asked U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last month whether the U.S. was trying to create an Asian version of NATO by emphasizing partnerships and alliances. They include a U.S. grouping with Britain and Australia; another with Australia, India and Japan; and one with Japan and South Korea.\n\n\"What implications do you think the strengthening of the U.S. alliance system in the Asia-Pacific will have on this region's security and stability?\" Cao asked at the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore.\n\nAustin replied that the U.S. was simply working with \"like-minded countries with similar values and a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nBeijing has its own conclusion.\n\n\"The real intent of the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy is to integrate all small circles into a big circle as the Asian version of NATO in order to maintain the hegemony as led by the United States,\" Chinese Lt. Gen. Jing Jianfeng said at the forum.\n\n___\n\nAP researcher Chen Wanqing in Beijing and AP writer Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk",

The final communique, known as the Washington Declaration, made it clear that China was becoming a focus of the military alliance due to its rising nuclear arsenal and its capabilities in space.\n\nBeijing has denied that it supports Russia's war efforts and insists that it conducts normal trade with its northern neighbour. However, relations between Moscow and Beijing are at their highest, as China has strengthened its trade and military ties with Russia in recent years, supplying machine tools, electronics and other items seen as contributing to the Russian war effort, without actually exporting weaponry. China has so far refused to condemn the Ukraine invasion and has actively called for both sides to discuss peace on the table.\n\nIn the communique, NATO member countries said China has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base. It called on China to cease all material and political support for Russia's war effort.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbours and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" read the communique, which referred to China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"The deepening strategic partnership between Russia and the PRC and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut and reshape the rules-based international order, are a cause for profound concern. We are confronted by hybrid, cyber, space, and other threats and malicious activities from state and non-state actors,\" said the declaration.\n\nIn its strongly worded Washington Declaration, NATO condemned Russia's \"irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and coercive nuclear signalling, including its announced stationing of nuclear weapons in Belarus,\" adding that Minsk continues to enable Russia's war in Ukraine. However, allies remain willing to maintain channels of communication with Moscow to \"mitigate risk and prevent escalation.\n\nThe declaration says the alliance will continue to support Ukraine \"on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership\" as Kyiv continues the \"vital work\" of democratic, economic and security reforms. It reaffirms that NATO will \"be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met.\"\n\nAllies of the transatlantic military alliance have also announced a minimum funding of 40 billion euros ($43.28 billion) in military aid for Kyiv within the next year, but stopped short of the multiyear financial pledge that NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had sought. Some diplomats see this as an effort to safeguard the process from a possible return of Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from China on the latest NATO declaration. Beijing has expressed displeasure at NATO's growing interest in Asia and demanded the alliance stay out of the Asia-Pacific region and not incite confrontation. \"NATO should not use China to justify its insertion into the Asia-Pacific and attempt to disrupt regional dynamics,\" said Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, on Tuesday.\n\nDanny Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for Asia and now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, called the new wording by NATO \"an extraordinary step\", particularly since it was coupled with the warning that Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to European interests and security in the same communique.\n\nIn May, China hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin for a two-day visit, where the two leaders had a detailed discussion on the entire range of issues related to the comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation between their countries. China has sought to project itself as a neutral party in the conflict, but has declared a \"no limits\" relationship with Russia in opposition to the West. It also proposed a 12-point peace plan for Ukraine, calling for a ceasefire and denouncing sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe closeness between China and Russia may make it uncomfortable for India and the United States amid the fact New Delhi remained the most tested friend of Moscow and Beijing and Moscow remains one of the top economic contenders of Washington. When it comes to New Delhi, it has shown a rigid spine to back Russia after Putin launched a full-fledged war against Ukraine. On the other hand, US President Biden Joe Biden showered tons of sanctions on Moscow in an attempt to penalise Moscow.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType":

He maintained that China has a fair and objective stance on the Ukraine issue.\n\nChina has broken with the United States and its European allies over the war in Ukraine, refusing to condemn Russia's invasion. Its trade with Russia has grown since the invasion, at least partially offsetting the impact of Western sanctions.\n\nNATO's sternly worded final communiqu\u00e9, approved by the 32 alliance members at their summit in Washington, makes clear that China is becoming a focus of the military alliance.\n\nThe European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China.\n\nBeijing insists that it does not provide military aid to Russia but has maintained strong trade ties with its northern neighbor throughout the conflict.

It's really a significant deliverable,\" Michael Carpenter, the senior director for Europe at the National Security Council, told VOA.\n\nStoltenberg said that when fighting stops in Ukraine, NATO will need to ensure that halt will be the final end to violence there.\n\nThe way to ensure it stops for good, Stoltenberg said, is NATO membership for Ukraine. Otherwise, he said, Russia could continue its aggression.\n\nUnlike the European Union, which began negotiations with Ukraine to join its ranks on June 25, there is no consensus yet about Ukraine joining NATO.\n\nF-16 transfer under way\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the first American-made F-16 fighter jets are currently being delivered to Ukraine and are expected to patrol Ukrainian skies in coming weeks.\n\n\"The transfer of F-16s is officially under way, and Ukraine will be flying F-16s this summer,\" he said at the summit.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and U.S. President Joe Biden announced that the Dutch and Danish governments were providing the F-16s, while Belgium and Norway had committed to send more aircraft to Ukraine.\n\nNATO member heads of state held their first working session of the summit Wednesday as they sought to boost the alliance's support for Ukraine and enhance their own defense and deterrence efforts.\n\nAt the start of the session, Biden said Russia was ramping up its defense production with Chinese, North Korean and Iranian help.\n\nTo counter their efforts, he said, NATO members must continue to invest more in defense production.\n\n\"We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind,\" Biden said.\n\nChina called out\n\nIn the NATO communique, all 32 allies on Wednesday also called on China to cease its support for Russia's war effort against Kyiv, including its transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment and raw materials that aid Russia's defense sector.\n\n\"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the leaders wrote.\n\nAsked by VOA whether the statement was a strong enough message to deter China from continuing to support Russia, Stoltenberg replied in the press conference that Wednesday's declaration is \"the strongest message that NATO allies have ever sent on China's contributions to Russia's illegal war against Ukraine.\"\n\nA spokesperson for China's mission to the European Union rejected the NATO statement, calling it \"filled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric.\"\n\nNATO allies invited Indo-Pacific partners from Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to also attend this week's summit.

It will provide a fresh chance for him to prove to the American public that he's capable of serving another four years after his shocking debate flop threw the future of his presidency into doubt.\n\nThe flurry of final events at the NATO summit come a day after NATO labeled China a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war against Ukraine. China in turn accused NATO of seeking security at the expense of others and it has warned the military alliance not to bring the same \"chaos\" to Asia.\n\n\"We appreciate the close partnership with your country, and not least because our security is not regional, it is global,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said as he welcomed South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the last day of the alliance's summit in Washington.\n\n\"This is clearly illustrated by the war in Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\nBiden shook hands with leaders as he walked into a Thursday morning meeting and smiled before taking a seat next to Stoltenberg.\n\nStoltenberg convened NATO leaders in the military alliance's main decision-making body, saying they would tackle \"shared security challenges, including Russia's war against Ukraine, China's support for Russia's war economy and the growing alignment of authoritarian powers.\"\n\nHe said allies must work ever closer to preserve peace.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is also taking part in the talks, said it was important to draw all partners into a conversation on how to ensure stability, notably as China strengthens its ties with Russia, but also in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\"China is supporting a Russia in the name of this unlimited friendship. (North) Korea is one of the most important suppliers of raw material to Russia,\" he told reporters. He noted that maritime border tensions \"in the Indo-Pacific puts a threat to the stability of the whole region.\"\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea are notably taking part in the summit.\n\nZelenskky will join allied leaders later for a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a forum set up a year ago for the 32 allies and Kyiv to meet on an equal footing to share concerns and information.\n\nOn Wednesday, NATO leaders promised Ukraine that it is on an \"irreversible path\" to membership, although it can only join sometime after the war, when the allies agree that it has met all the conditions.\n\nA missile attack on Ukraine's biggest children's hospital on the eve of the summit in Washington, to mark NATO's 75th anniversary, underscored that Russian President Vladimir Putin may not be ready to make peace for some time.\n\nMany allies also offered more military support, and NATO launched a new program to underwrite deliveries of military equipment and coordinate training for Ukraine's beleaguered armed forces. NATO members also committed to keep up current levels of military aid -- about 40 billion euros ($43.5 billion) annually -- for at least a year.", "source": {"uri": "mynorthwest.com", "dataType":

But the alliance has accused China of building up Russia's war machine by providing critical components.\n\nAccording to US assessment, China is the top supplier of machine tools, microelectronics, nitrocellulose - which is critical to making munitions and rocket-propellers - and other dual use items Moscow uses to ramp up its defense industrial base.\n\nChina's behavior during the war in Ukraine is being viewed by NATO countries as proof that Europe cannot afford to ignore the challenge Beijing poses.\n\nAccording to a senior US state department official, the alliance is now \"focused like a laser on the relationship between China and Russia.\"\n\nThis is quite a shift for an organization that has been traditionally focused on security in the transatlantic area. China was not featured in a high-level NATO public document until the end of 2019. Only in its latest strategic concept, agreed in Madrid in 2022, the alliance describes Beijing's ambitions as a challenge to its security.\n\n\"There is a shift,\" Liselotte Odgaard, a senior fellow with the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C., told DW. A shift that started under former US President Donald Trump and \"has taken off in Europe.\"\n\nOdgaard pointed out that the US considered China the principal threat for its security interests for a long time. \"But they have convinced Europe - and pushed Europeans - to see that China is also a problem for Europe and for the whole US alliance system,\" she said.\n\nMany in Europe now seem to acknowledge that US allies in Asia and Europe face some of the same challenges. \"And as Russia and China cooperate, there is a need to mirror that cooperation by strengthening European cooperation with Asian partners,\" Odgaard said.\n\nConfronted with a more assertive and aggressive China, some countries in Asia also seem to be convinced of a need for more cooperation.\n\nWhen Japan's prime minister addressed a session of the US Congress in April this year, he spoke about Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \"Ukraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow,\" Fumio Kishida told US lawmakers.\n\nIn June, South Korean National Security Advisor Chang Ho-jin told reporters Seoul will review the possibility of supplying weapons to Ukraine, after the leaders of North Korea and Russia signed a pact pledging mutual defense in the event of war.\n\nNATO has collaborated with partners in the Indo-Pacific since the early 2000s, but Russia's war against Ukraine and security challenges posed by China have led to a deeper engagement.\n\nThe alliance views these countries who share a region with China and bring new insights to the table as partners to counter China's and Russia's attempts to challenge the rules-based global order.\n\nLeaders from Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand have been invited to take part in the gathering in Washington, D.C. This will be already the third summit with their participation.\n\nAhead of the meeting, NATO chief Stoltenberg said the alliance and its Indo-Pacific partners \"will build on our practical cooperation with flagship projects on Ukraine, cyber, and new technologies.\" They also want to work more closely on defense industrial production.\n\nBut beyond that, NATO member states are divided over their approach to the Indo-Pacific region. Last year, France blocked a NATO plan to open a liaison office in Japan, insisting the alliance is geographically confined to the North Atlantic.\n\nGermany acknowledges the importances of the region in general. Berlin, however, considers China - despite its increasingly assertive policies - still as an essential partner to meet global challenges.\n\nHungary meanwhile cooperates intensively with China, for instance in the area of electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition, some observers say that NATO's involvement in the Indo-Pacific would not be welcomed by everyone. \"This is a very volatile region. But there are no hot wars at the moment,\" Shada Islam, an independent EU advisor in Brussels, told DW.\n\n\"Most of the countries that I speak to, whether it's Indonesia or Malaysia or even India, don't want this foreign power to come to the region and perhaps make things worse,\" Islam said.\n\nSo, getting tougher on China and establishing closer bonds with partners in the Indo-Pacific will remain a difficult balancing act for NATO.\n\n\"It's a balancing act because there is a risk of escalation,\" Liselotte Odgaard at Hudson Institute told DW.\n\nIf NATO countries push too hard, she said, China could decide to cooperate even more with Russia, North Korea and Iran. That certainly would not be in the interest of NATO.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Beijing in response warned the alliance against \"provoking confrontation\" over China's ties with Russia.\n\nIn a declaration shared from their summit in Washington, NATO leaders expressed \"deep concern,\" over China's deepening ties with Russia reports AFP. They said that China \"has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called 'no limits' partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base.\"\n\nThe communique called on China to \"cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" including \"the transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment, and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia's defence sector.\"\n\nAlso read | NATO summit: Ukraine gets F-16 jets, 'irreversible' path to bloc membership\n\nAs per Reuters, it also expressed concern about Beijing's expanding space capabilities and referred to the nation's rapid expansion of its nuclear arsenal, urging China to engage in strategic risk reduction talks.\n\nThe NATO leaders also warned China that it \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation.\"\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the press later that this was the first time the 32 NATO allies had come together to label China this way, and that it was an important message.\n\n\"I think the message sent from NATO from this summit is very strong and very clear, and we are clearly defining China's responsibility when it comes to enabling Russia's war,\" said the outgoing Secretary-General.\n\nAlso read | Zelensky says

China said NATO had a \"Cold War mentality\" and \"belligerent rhetoric.\"\n\nNATO on Wednesday accused China of being \"a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" and demanded that it stop aiding Moscow's military or face the consequences.\n\nIn the alliance's Washington Summit declaration, published before a White House dinner with its leader, it called on China \"to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort.\"\n\nThe declaration, the first of its kind, said China had been a major supplier of weapon components and defense equipment to Russia since the start of the war.\n\nIt included an implicit threat. \"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the declaration said.\n\nNatalie Sabanadze, a senior research fellow at Chatham House in London, told The New York Times she expected European countries to \"start sanctioning Chinese companies slowly, while carefully weighing consequences and a potential backlash.\"\n\nShe added that NATO's warning \"tells China that there will be costs.\"\n\nThe strongest rebuke yet\n\nJens Stoltenberg, NATO's secretary-general, described the language as the \"strongest message NATO allies have ever sent on China's contributions to Russia's illegal war against Ukraine.\"\n\nNATO and the US believe China has supplied Russia with equipment such as chips and integrated circuits, which can be used to produce weapons. In response, China has said it is not a party to the Ukraine war and that there should be no interference with trade between China and Russia.\n\nChina hit back at the latest accusations, describing them as \"prejudice, smears and provocation.\" It added that NATO had a \"Cold War mentality\" and \"belligerent rhetoric.\"\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jin said \"NATO hyped up China's responsibility\" in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It makes no sense and comes with malicious intent,\" Lin said.\n\n\"We urge NATO to reflect on the root cause of the crisis and what it has done, and take concrete action to de-escalate rather than shift blame.\"\n\nA shift in NATO's stance\n\nThe declaration marks a key shift in NATO's stance on China. As The New York Times reported, the alliance used bland language when discussing issues or concerns surrounding China in the past. It first named the country as a concern in 2019.\n\nEuropean countries have historically been hesitant to stand against Beijing, known for its distribution of luxury items and cars, The Times reported.\n\nBut the language surrounding China has subtly evolved.\n\nLast week, NATO member and Finland's President Alexander Stubb said in an interview with Bloomberg that China has so much influence on Russia that it could effectively end the war.\n\n\"I argue that Russia is so dependent on China right now that one phone call from President Xi Jinping would solve this crisis,\" Stubb said.\"If he were to say, 'Time to start negotiating peace.' Russia would be forced to do that.\"\n\n\"They would have no other choice,\" he added.\n\nJake Sullivan, a national security advisor to President Biden, said the NATO declaration shows that its members \"now collectively understand this challenge,\" according to The Times.\n\n\"If this PRC support continues, it will degrade its relations across Europe, and the United States will continue to impose sanctions on PRC entities involved in this activity, in coordination with our European allies,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO pledged to continue to provide long-term security to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the declaration, NATO members have collectively contributed \u20ac40 billion, or around $43.4 billion, in military aid to Ukraine each year since the war began in February 2022. The alliance said it aims to contribute the same amount in 2024.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business

The European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China.\n\nBeijing insists that it does not provide military aid to Russia but has maintained strong trade ties with its northern neighbor throughout the conflict. It also accuses NATO of overreaching and inciting confrontation in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, NATO member countries said China has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" read the communiqu\u00e9, which referred to China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the document says.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said China provides equipment, microelectronics and tools that are \"enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine.\"\n\nHe said it was the first time all NATO allies have stated this so clearly in an agreed document.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington on Wednesday said China is neither a creator of nor a party to the Ukraine crisis. \"China does not provide weapons to the parties to the conflict and strictly controls the export of dual-use articles, which is widely applauded by the international community,\" said Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman.\n\nHe said China's normal trade with Russia is \"done aboveboard\" and \"beyond reproach.\"\n\nDanny Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for Asia, called the new wording by NATO \"an extraordinary step,\" particularly because it was coupled with the warning that Beijing continues to pose \"systemic challenges\" to European interests and security.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nSC expects another million residents by 2042.

It was first raised in 2021.\n\nThe alliance said China has been behind sustained, malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation and expressed concerns over China's space capabilities and activities. It also raised alarms that China is rapidly expanding and diversifying its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems.\n\nLiu, the Chinese embassy spokesman, said China handles such issues \"in a responsible manner with transparent policies.\"\n\n\"Hyping up the so-called 'China threat' is completely futile,\" Liu said, adding Beijing firmly opposes NATO's use of regional hotspot issues to smear China and incite a new Cold War.\n\nIn Washington, where leaders of NATO nations are convening this week to mark the coalition's 75th anniversary, President Joe Biden said the alliance must not fall behind Russia, which is ramping up weapon production with the help of China, North Korea and Iran.\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea have sent their leaders or deputies to the NATO summit in Washington this week. They are partners, not members, of the alliance.\n\nIn the final declaration, NATO members affirmed the importance of the Indo-Pacific partners to the alliance and said they were \"strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges.\"\n\nNATO and the Indo-Pacific partners plan to launch four projects to support Ukraine, bolster cooperation on cyber defense, counter disinformation and work on artificial intelligence. The NATO members said these projects would \"enhance our ability to work together on shared security interests.\"", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@postandcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_release", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Press release"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indo-Pacific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charter of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_mission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic mission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamma_Mia!_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mamma Mia!

The 32 leaders of the alliance approved the sternly worded communiqu\u00e9 during their summit in Washington, making clear that China is becoming a focus of the military alliance.\n\nThe declaration made a major departure as until 2019, NATO never officially mentioned China as a concern, and then only in the blandest of language, reported the New York Times.\n\nWhile China has insisted that it does not provide military aid to Russia, it has maintained strong trade ties with its northern neighbour throughout the conflict. Beijing has also accused NATO of overreaching and inciting confrontation in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nALSO READ: NATO Allies Have Begun Transfer Of F-16 Jets To Ukraine, Says US\n\nIn the declaration, China has been said to become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base, reported the Associated Press.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbours and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" stated the communiqu\u00e9, referring China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the declaration read, as per the AP report.\n\nALSO

microelectronics and tools that are \"enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington refuted the accusations saying China is neither a creator nor a party to the Ukraine crisis.\n\n\"China does not provide weapons to the parties to the conflict and strictly controls the

Spokane", "body": "NATO leaders on Thursday looked to bolster ties with Asian partners after slamming China as a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war, before holding talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of a summit in Washington.\n\nThe 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled set piece in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Moscow and backing for Kyiv.\n\nThe three-day gathering has been overshadowed by political uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden -- who will give a press conference Thursday -- fights for his own political survival.\n\nAfter spending the bulk of the summit focused on bolstering Ukraine, NATO shifted attention eastwards by welcoming the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nA strongly-worded declaration from NATO released Wednesday called Beijing a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its supplies of dual-use goods such as microchips that can help Moscow's military.\n\nChina \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" NATO leaders said.\n\nBeijing hit back by warning NATO to \"stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry.\"\n\nChina presents itself as a neutral party in the conflict, but it has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nThe United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the challenges posed by China.\n\nThe Washington summit is the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.\n\nDiplomats said several initiatives with the partner countries were due to be announced, including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation, and providing Ukraine non-lethal help.\n\nBut the Pacific leaders' presence is more about signaling NATO's greater interest in the region at a time of growing competition between Washington and Beijing.\n\n- US missiles, Kremlin warning -\n\nAfter that sit-down, Ukraine's Zelensky will take center stage at the giant convention center in the heart of the US capital.\n\nHe will join his NATO counterparts after getting promises of new air defences for Ukraine and as Kyiv gets closer to finally receiving long-promised F-16 jets.\n\nBut Zelensky has called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further -- including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.\n\nThe United States on Wednesday also announced an important step to bolster NATO's own deterrence against Russia in Europe by saying it would begin \"episodic deployments\" of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026.\n\nThe White House said it would eventually look to permanently station them in Germany, and the missiles would \"have significantly longer range\" than current US systems in Europe.\n\nThe Kremlin on Thursday struck back, saying it was planning \"response measures\" to contain the \"very serious threat\" from NATO, accusing the alliance of being \"fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine.\"\n\nThe leader of NATO member Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said that any possibility of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO was \"worrying.\"\n\n\"Any steps that could lead to this outcome should be consciously avoided,\" said the Turkish leader, one of the few NATO members to have maintained ties with Russia since the invasion.\n\nAmid worries by key allies of drawing the alliance closer to war, NATO's leaders on Wednesday once again demurred from issuing Ukraine a clear invitation to join their alliance.\n\nZelensky unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at a summit in Lithuania last year by lambasting NATO's reluctance on membership.\n\nIn a bid to soften any disappointment this time around, NATO leaders called Ukraine's path to membership \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military support \"within the next year.\"\n\ndel/mlm\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_delany@fox28spokane.com", "name": "Max

appreciated by the international community,\" said the spokesperson.\n\nIn its final communique at Washington summit, NATO bloc said that China has become a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war effort in Ukraine, and Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.\n\nThe sternly worded communique, approved by the 32 NATO members at their summit in Washington DC, makes clear that China is becoming a focus of the military alliance.\n\n\"The PRC [China] cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the document said.", "source": {"uri": "trtworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TRT World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noureldein_ghanem@trtworld.com", "name": "Noureldein Ghanem",

China will be following the summit closely, worried by the alliance's growing interest beyond Europe and the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\"Increasingly, partners in Europe see challenges halfway around the world in Asia as being relevant to them, just as partners in Asia see challenges halfway around the world in Europe as being relevant to them,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last week at the Brookings Institution.\n\nNATO SUMMIT IN DC IS 'PIVOTAL' MAKE-OR-BREAK FOR BIDEN AS SCRUTINY OVER FITNESS FOR OFFICE INTENSIFIES\n\nAmerica's top diplomat said the U.S. has been working to break down barriers between European alliances, Asian coalitions and other partners worldwide. \"That's part of the new landscape, the new geometry that we've put in place.\"\n\nWhite House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday that NATO allies and the Indo-Pacific partners will launch four new joint projects, which will be on Ukraine, artificial intelligence, disinformation and cybersecurity.\n\n\"Each initiative is different, but the main goal is the same: harness the unique strengths of highly capable democracies to address shared challenges,\" Sullivan said at a defense industry forum.\n\nCountries with shared security concerns are strengthening ties as competition escalates between the United States and China. Washington is trying to curb Beijing's ambition to challenge the U.S.-led world order, which the Chinese government dismisses as a Cold War mentality aimed at containing China's inevitable rise.\n\nBIDEN DELIVERS STRONG SPEECH TOUTING NATO AMID HEALTH QUESTIONS, DEMOCRATS' CONCERNS\n\nBeijing has responded angrily to the prospect of NATO and its four Indo-Pacific partners deepening their cooperation.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, on Monday accused NATO of \"breaching its boundary, expanding its mandate, reaching beyond its defense zone and stoking confrontation.\"\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which has pitted the West against Russia and its friends, has bolstered the argument for closer cooperation between the U.S., Europe and their Asian allies. \"Ukraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow,\" Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the U.S. Congress in April.\n\nThe U.S. and South Korea accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with ammunition, while Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea last month and signed a pact with leader Kim Jong Un that envisions mutual military assistance.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan, meanwhile, are sending military supplies and aid to Ukraine. The U.S. also says China is providing Russia with machine tools, microelectronics and other technology that allow it to make weapons to use against Ukraine.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol will bring to Washington \"a strong message regarding the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea and discuss ways to enhance cooperation among NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners,\" his principal deputy national security adviser, Kim Tae-hyo, told reporters Friday.\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said discussions would \"focus on our collective efforts to support the rules-based system.\"\n\nThe partnership does not make NATO a direct player in the Indo-Pacific but allows it to coordinate with the four partners on issues of mutual concern, said Mirna Galic, senior policy analyst on China and East Asia at the U.S. Institute of Peace. For example, she wrote in an analysis, they can share information and align on actions such as sanctions and aid delivery but do not intervene in military crises outside of their own regions.\n\nThe NATO summit will allow the United States and its European and Indo-Pacific allies to push back against China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, according to Luis Simon, director of the Centre for Security Diplomacy and Strategy at Vrije Universiteit Brussel.\n\n\"The fact that the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific alliances are structured around a clear anchor -- U.S. military power -- makes them more cohesive and gives them a strategic edge as compared to the sort of interlocking partnerships that bind China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea,\" Simon wrote in a commentary last week on War On the Rocks, a defense and foreign affairs website.\n\nBeijing is worried by NATO's pivot to the east, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in eastern China. Beijing has insisted that NATO not interfere in security affairs in the Indo-Pacific and that it should change its view of China as a strategic adversary.\n\n\"NATO should consider China as a positive force for the regional peace and stability and for global security,\" Zhu said. \"We also hope the Ukraine war can end as soon as possible ... and we have rejected a return to the triangular relation with Russia and North Korea.\"\n\n\"In today's volatile and fragile world, Europe, the U.S. and China should strengthen global and regional cooperation,\" Zhu said.\n\nNATO and China had little conflict until tensions grew between Beijing and Washington in 2019, the same year the NATO summit in London raised China as a \"challenge\" that \"we need to address together as an alliance.\" Two years later, NATO upgraded China to a \"systemic challenge\" and said Beijing was \"cooperating militarily with Russia.\"\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand attended a NATO summit for the first time, where statements noted the geopolitical challenges China poses. Beijing accused NATO of \"cooperating with the U.S. government for an all-around suppression of China.\"\n\nNow, Beijing is worried that Washington is forming a NATO-like alliance in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nChinese Senior Col. Cao Yanzhong, a researcher at China's Institute of War Studies, asked U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last month whether the U.S. was trying to create an Asian version of NATO by emphasizing partnerships and alliances. They include a U.S. grouping with Britain and Australia; another with Australia, India and Japan; and one with Japan and South Korea.\n\n\"What implications do you think the strengthening of the U.S. alliance system in the Asia-Pacific will have on this region's security and stability?\" Cao asked at the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit in Singapore.\n\nAustin replied that the U.S. was simply working with \"like-minded countries with similar values and a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nBeijing has its own conclusion.\n\n\"The real intent of the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy is to integrate all small circles into a big circle as the Asian version of NATO in order to maintain the hegemony as led by the United States,\" Chinese Lt. Gen. Jing Jianfeng said at the forum.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type":

The joint statement stressed that these measures, as well as individual aid commitments, serve as a \"bridge to Ukraine's NATO membership\".\n\nRecognising Ukraine's recent progress in necessary reforms, NATO noted that a formal invitation to join the alliance would be made only when certain conditions were met.\n\n\"As Ukraine continues this important work, we will continue to support Ukraine on its irreversible path towards full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership,\" the statement said.\n\nThe statement also accused China of being a \"crucial enabler\" of Russia's war against Ukraine, making some of the harshest comments to China to date. This provoked an angry reaction from Beijing's EU mission, which called on NATO to \"stop hyping the so-called Chinese threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry\".\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was also invited to a NATO summit where he met with world leaders and US politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties in an effort to strengthen cross-party support for Ukraine.\n\nNATO leaders at the summit tried to take a united stance on Ukraine, but may have disappointed Kyiv by not setting a timeframe for full NATO membership.\n\nThe summit, marking NATO's 75th anniversary, took place ahead of a potentially crucial US election that could return NATO critic Donald Trump to the White House, further complicating political problems for President Joe Biden.\n\nAt the summit, President Biden reaffirmed his support for Ukraine and urged NATO members to increase defence investment, stressing that Russia, supported by North Korea and Iran, is operating on \"war footing\" in terms of arms production.\n\n\"We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind,\" Biden said. \"We can and will defend every inch of NATO territory, and we will do it together.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnn-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baltic News Network - News from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Beijing has denied supplying weaponry and maintains it keeps strict controls on such goods.\n\nThe NATO leaders also elaborated to a greater extent than in the past on concerns over China's growing capabilities and activities in outer space, and reiterated their previous unease about what they called Beijing's \"malicious cyber and hybrid activities,\" including disinformation, and \"rapidly\" expanding nuclear arsenal.\n\n\"We remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency with the view of safeguarding the Alliance's security interests,\" the statement said, referring to China by the initials of its official name.\n\n\"At the same time, we are boosting our shared awareness, enhancing our resilience and preparedness, and protecting against the PRC's coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.\"\n\nThe NATO leaders' declaration Wednesday comes as the 32-member alliance - historically focused on security in North America and Europe - has in recent years upped its engagement with US allies in Asia and increasingly seen its security as linked to the region - even as member countries have pursued divergent policies toward China.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, leaders of New Zealand, Japan and South Korea attended the NATO leaders' summit in another sign of closer ties between the bloc and those countries, as well as Australia.\n\nBeijing has deepened political, economic and military ties with Moscow since President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in February 2022 declared a \"no limits\" partnership - and their shared opposition to what they said was NATO's expansion - during the Russian leader's visit to the Chinese capital, weeks before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nChina has surpassed the European Union to become Russia's top trade partner, offering a crucial lifeline to its economy, which has been heavily sanctioned in the wake of that invasion, while the two nuclear-armed neighbors have continued to hold joint military exercises.\n\nMeanwhile, China has claimed neutrality in the war and sought to posit itself as a potential peace broker, even as the US and European leaders have become increasingly alarmed about what they say is Beijing's backing of Moscow through its economic and diplomatic support, as well as the provision of dual-use goods.\n\nOn Thursday, China criticized the NATO statement as \"filled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric,\" and said it was \"provocative with obvious lies and smears.\"\n\n\"China is not the creator to the Ukraine crisis. China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard. We aim to promote peace talks and seek political settlement,\" a statement from its mission to the European Union said.\n\nThe Chinese statement also reiterated Beijing's position that it has never provided lethal weapons in the conflict and has strict dual-use export controls, defending its trade with Russia as \"normal.\"\n\nThe US and European leaders have in recent months raised alarm that such exports are revitalizing Russia's defense sector and allowing it to survive despite hefty international sanctions. The US has said that dual-use exports have specifically enabled the production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles.\n\nBoth the US and the EU have sanctioned Chinese entities they allege are supporting the war effort.\n\nThe NATO leaders' declaration is the latest step in what has been the bloc's gradual hardening of tone on China in recent years.\n\nNATO leaders first mentioned the need to jointly address \"opportunities and challenges\" posed by China in a 2019 declaration, before moving to refer to \"systemic challenges\" the country poses in 2021.\n\nThat shift has come alongside an increased US policy focus on the Indo-Pacific amid a deepening rivalry with Beijing as China under Xi's leadership has grown increasingly aggressive in the region and in its broader foreign policy.\n\nNATO's attention on Asia has also been accelerated over the past two and a half years by hardening geopolitical fault lines in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin's tightening relationship with not only China but also North Korea and Iran.\n\nNATO leaders on Wednesday also said Pyongyang and Tehran were \"fueling\" Russia's war through \"direct military support,\" and condemned North Korea's exports of \"artillery shells and ballistic missiles\" to Russia - which multiple governments say they have tracked since last year when Putin hosted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the Russian Far East.\n\n\"The Indo-Pacific is important for NATO, given that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security,\" the leaders said in their declaration.\n\n\"We are strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges and are enhancing our practical cooperation, including through flagship projects in the areas of supporting Ukraine, cyber defense, countering disinformation, and technology,\" it said.\n\nBeijing has watched warily as NATO's engagement grows with other powers in the Asia-Pacific. China is widely seen by observers as hoping to be the dominant force in the region and to push back on the US presence there, as Washington bolsters its longstanding Indo-Pacific security partnerships and interests.\n\nChina and Russia have also converged over their shared opposition to NATO, part of a broader aspiration from both to reshape a world order they see as unfairly dominated by the US, and both have blamed the Western security alliance for provoking Moscow to invade Ukraine.\n\nIn its statement Thursday, Beijing's EU mission called on NATO to \"correct its wrong perception of China,\" and \"abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game.\"\n\n\"The Asia-Pacific region is a place for peaceful development, not a wrestling ground for geopolitical competition ... NATO should not become the disrupter of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific,\" the statement said.", "source": {"uri": "egyptindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Egypt Independent"},

He also urged cooperation to confront new security threats that transcend geographical boundaries, such as cyber-attacks and conflicts in space.\n\nSouth Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, which along with Japan are known as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP4), are also attending the July 10-11 meeting with NATO leaders.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told Reuters this week that he planned to discuss the threat Pyongyang poses to Europe by deepening its Russia ties.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-Un signed a mutual defense pledge with Russia last month during President Vladimir Putin's first visit to Pyongyang in 24 years and expressed his \"full support\" for Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nSouth Korea's president is set to discuss with NATO leaders the \"distinct threat\" North Korea's deepening military ties with Russia posed to Europe, with the transatlantic security alliance meeting in Washington starting Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have accused Pyongyang of providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells that Russia has used in its war in Ukraine and say they fear Moscow in return could provide support for North Korea's nuclear missile development.\n\nWashington has also said China is supplying drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools to Russia, items which fall short of lethal assistance but are helping Moscow build its military to sustain the Ukraine war. Beijing has said it has not provided any weaponry to any party.\n\nWithout naming China, Kishida told Reuters \"some countries\" have allegedly transferred dual-use civilian-military goods to Russia which has served \"as a lifeline\" for its Ukraine war.\n\n\"It is necessary to grapple with such situations in a multi-faceted and strategic manner, taking a panoramic view that considers the full range of international actors fuelling Russia's attempt to change the status quo by force,\" he said.\n\n\"The geographical boundary of 'Euro-Atlantic' or 'Indo-Pacific' is no longer relevant in safeguarding global peace and security. Japan and Indo-Pacific partners can play a great role for NATO allies from this perspective.\"\n\nConstrained by decades of pacifism, Tokyo has been reluctant to supply lethal aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt has, however, provided financial aid to Kyiv, spearheaded efforts to prepare for its post-war reconstruction, and contributed to NATO's fund to provide Ukraine with non-lethal equipment such as anti-drone detection systems.\n\nTokyo has also repeatedly warned about the risks of a similar conflict emerging in East Asia, where China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance towards its territorial claims including the democratic island of Taiwan.\n\n\"This summit is a critical opportunity for Japan, the U.S., and the other NATO allies to confront the ongoing challenges against the international order and to reaffirm values and principles that have shaped global peace and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nThere may be limits, however, over how far NATO members are prepared to go in forging closer ties in Asia. A plan that surfaced last year for NATO to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, was blocked by France and criticized by China.\n\nREUTERS", "source": {"uri": "en.tempo.co", "dataType":

"NATO boosts Asia ties in face of China, Zelensky attends", "body": "Prime Minister of New Zealand Christopher Luxon (L), South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol (3L), Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (3R) and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (R) appear on a White House after a NATO welcoming ceremony\n\nNATO leaders on Thursday looked to bolster ties with Asian partners after slamming China as a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war, before holding talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of a summit in Washington.\n\nThe 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled set piece in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Moscow and backing for Kyiv.\n\nThe three-day gathering has been overshadowed by political uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden -- who will give a press conference Thursday -- fights for his own political survival.\n\nAfter spending the bulk of the summit focused on bolstering Ukraine, NATO shifted attention eastwards by welcoming the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nA strongly-worded declaration from NATO released Wednesday called Beijing a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its supplies of dual-use goods such as microchips that can help Moscow's military.\n\nChina \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" NATO leaders said.\n\nBeijing hit back by warning NATO to \"stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry.\"\n\nChina presents itself as a neutral party in the conflict, but it has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nThe United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the challenges posed by China.\n\nThe Washington summit is the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.\n\nDiplomats said several initiatives with the partner countries were due to be announced, including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation, and providing Ukraine non-lethal help.\n\nBut the Pacific leaders' presence is more about signaling NATO's greater interest in the region at a time of growing competition between Washington and Beijing.\n\n- US missiles, Kremlin warning -\n\nAfter that sit-down, Ukraine's Zelensky will take center stage at the giant convention center in the heart of the US capital.\n\nHe will join his NATO counterparts after getting promises of new air defences for Ukraine and as Kyiv gets closer to finally receiving long-promised F-16 jets.\n\nBut Zelensky has called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further -- including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.\n\nThe United States on Wednesday also announced an important step to bolster NATO's own deterrence against Russia in Europe by saying it would begin \"episodic deployments\" of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026.\n\nThe White House said it would eventually look to permanently station them in Germany, and the missiles would \"have significantly longer range\" than current US systems in Europe.\n\nThe Kremlin on Thursday struck back, saying it was planning \"response measures\" to contain the \"very serious threat\" from NATO, accusing the alliance of being \"fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine.\"\n\nThe leader of NATO member Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said that any possibility of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO was \"worrying.\"\n\n\"Any steps that could lead to this outcome should be consciously avoided,\" said the Turkish leader, one of the few NATO members to have maintained ties with Russia since the invasion.\n\nAmid worries by key allies of drawing the alliance closer to war, NATO's leaders on Wednesday once again demurred from issuing Ukraine a clear invitation to join their alliance.\n\nZelensky unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at a summit in Lithuania last year by lambasting NATO's reluctance on membership.\n\nIn a bid to soften any disappointment this time around, NATO leaders called Ukraine's path to membership \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military support \"within the next year.\"\n\ndel/mlm\n\nMore from this section\n\nProNotary Announces Exciting New Partner Program\n\nEighteen homebuyer assistance programs offering up to $117,000

In response, China has said it is not a party to the Ukraine war and that there should be no interference with trade between China and Russia.\n\nChina hit back at the latest accusations, describing them as \"prejudice, smears and provocation.\" It added that NATO had a \"Cold War mentality\" and \"belligerent rhetoric.\"\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jin said \"NATO hyped up China's responsibility\" in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It makes no sense and comes with malicious intent,\" Lin said.\n\n\"We urge NATO to reflect on the root cause of the crisis and what it has done, and take concrete action to de-escalate rather than shift blame.\"\n\nThe declaration marks a key shift in NATO's stance on China. As The New York Times reported, the alliance used bland language when discussing issues or concerns surrounding China in the past. It first named the country as a concern in 2019.\n\nEuropean countries have historically been hesitant to stand against Beijing, known for its distribution of luxury items and cars, The Times reported.\n\nBut the language surrounding China has subtly evolved.\n\nLast week, NATO member and Finland's President Alexander Stubb said in an interview with Bloomberg that China has so much influence on Russia that it could effectively end the war.\n\n\"I argue that Russia is so dependent on China right now that one phone call from President Xi Jinping would solve this crisis,\" Stubb said.\"If he were to say, 'Time to start negotiating peace.' Russia would be forced to do that.\"\n\n\"They would have no other choice,\" he added.\n\nJake Sullivan, a national security advisor to President Biden, said the NATO declaration shows that its members \"now collectively understand this challenge,\" according to The Times.\n\n\"If this PRC support continues, it will degrade its relations across Europe, and the United States will continue to impose sanctions on PRC entities involved in this activity, in coordination with our European allies,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, NATO pledged to continue to provide long-term security to Ukraine.\n\nAccording to the declaration, NATO members have collectively contributed \u20ac40 billion, or around $43.4 billion, in military aid to Ukraine each year since the war began in February 2022. The alliance said it aims to contribute the same amount in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Beijing has denied supplying weaponry and maintains it keeps strict controls on such goods.\n\nThe NATO leaders also elaborated to a greater extent than in the past on concerns over China's growing capabilities and activities in outer space, and reiterated their previous unease about what they called Beijing's \"malicious cyber and hybrid activities,\" including disinformation, and \"rapidly\" expanding nuclear arsenal.\n\n\"We remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency with the view of safeguarding the Alliance's security interests,\" the statement said, referring to China by the initials of its official name.\n\n\"At the same time, we are boosting our shared awareness, enhancing our resilience and preparedness, and protecting against the PRC's coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.\"\n\nThe NATO leaders' declaration Wednesday comes as the 32-member alliance - historically focused on security in North America and Europe - has in recent years upped its engagement with US allies in Asia and increasingly seen its security as linked to the region - even as member countries have pursued divergent policies toward China.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, leaders of New Zealand, Japan and South Korea attended the NATO leaders' summit in another sign of closer ties between the bloc and those countries, as well as Australia.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping welcomes Russian President Vladimir Putin for a state visit to China on May 16, 2024.\n\nSergei Bobylov/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nChina and Russia's tightening ties\n\nBeijing has deepened political, economic and military ties with Moscow since President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in February 2022 declared a \"no limits\" partnership - and their shared opposition to what they said was NATO's expansion - during the Russian leader's visit to the Chinese capital, weeks before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nChina has surpassed the European Union to become Russia's top trade partner, offering a crucial lifeline to its economy, which has been heavily sanctioned in the wake of that invasion, while the two nuclear-armed neighbors have continued to hold joint military exercises.\n\nMeanwhile, China has claimed neutrality in the war and sought to posit itself as a potential peace broker, even as the US and European leaders have become increasingly alarmed about what they say is Beijing's backing of Moscow through its economic and diplomatic support, as well as the provision of dual-use goods.\n\nOn Thursday, China criticized the NATO statement as \"filled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric,\" and said it was \"provocative with obvious lies and smears.\"\n\n\"China is not the creator to the Ukraine crisis. China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard. We aim to promote peace talks and seek political settlement,\" a statement from its mission to the European Union said.\n\nThe Chinese statement also reiterated Beijing's position that it has never provided lethal weapons in the conflict and has strict dual-use export controls, defending its trade with Russia as \"normal.\"\n\nThe US and European leaders have in recent months raised alarm that such exports are revitalizing Russia's defense sector and allowing it to survive despite hefty international sanctions. The US has said that dual-use exports have specifically enabled the production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles.\n\nBoth the US and the EU have sanctioned Chinese entities they allege are supporting the war effort.\n\nNATO's increasing focus on Asia\n\nThe NATO leaders' declaration is the latest step in what has been the bloc's gradual hardening of tone on China in recent years.\n\nNATO leaders first mentioned the need to jointly address \"opportunities and challenges\" posed by China in a 2019 declaration, before moving to refer to \"systemic challenges\" the country poses in 2021.\n\nThat shift has come alongside an increased US policy focus on the Indo-Pacific amid a deepening rivalry with Beijing as China under Xi's leadership has grown increasingly aggressive in the region and in its broader foreign policy.\n\nNATO's attention on Asia has also been accelerated over the past two and a half years by hardening geopolitical fault lines in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin's tightening relationship with not only China but also North Korea and Iran.\n\nNATO leaders on Wednesday also said Pyongyang and Tehran were \"fueling\" Russia's war through \"direct military support,\" and condemned North Korea's exports of \"artillery shells and ballistic missiles\" to Russia - which multiple governments say they have tracked since last year when Putin hosted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the Russian Far East.\n\n\"The Indo-Pacific is important for NATO, given that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security,\" the leaders said in their declaration.\n\n\"We are strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges and are enhancing our practical cooperation, including through flagship projects in the areas of supporting Ukraine, cyber defense, countering disinformation, and technology,\" it said.\n\nBeijing has watched warily as NATO's engagement grows with other powers in the Asia-Pacific. China is widely seen by observers as hoping to be the dominant force in the region and to push back on the US presence there, as Washington bolsters its longstanding Indo-Pacific security partnerships and interests.\n\nChina and Russia have also converged over their shared opposition to NATO, part of a broader aspiration from both to reshape a world order they see as unfairly dominated by the US, and both have blamed the Western security alliance for provoking Moscow to invade Ukraine.\n\nIn its statement Thursday, Beijing's EU mission called on NATO to \"correct its wrong perception of China,\" and \"abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game.\"\n\n\"The Asia-Pacific region is a place for peaceful development, not a wrestling ground for geopolitical competition ... NATO should not become the disrupter of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific,\" the statement said.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

used the pomp-filled set piece in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Moscow and backing for Kyiv.\n\nThe three-day gathering has been overshadowed by political uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden -- who will give a press conference Thursday -- fights for his own political survival.\n\nAfter spending the bulk of the summit focused on bolstering Ukraine, NATO shifted attention eastwards by welcoming the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nA strongly-worded declaration from NATO released Wednesday called Beijing a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its supplies of dual-use goods such as microchips that can help Moscow's military.\n\nChina \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" NATO leaders said.\n\nBeijing hit back by warning NATO to \"stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry.\"\n\nChina presents itself as a neutral party in the conflict, but it has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nThe United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the challenges posed by China.\n\nThe Washington summit is the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.\n\nDiplomats said several initiatives with the partner countries were due to be announced, including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation, and providing Ukraine non-lethal help.\n\nBut the Pacific leaders' presence is more about signaling NATO's greater interest in the region at a time of growing competition between Washington and Beijing.\n\nAfter that sit-down, Ukraine's Zelensky will take center stage at the giant convention center in the heart of the US capital.\n\nHe will join his NATO counterparts after getting promises of new air defences for Ukraine and as Kyiv gets closer to finally receiving long-promised F-16 jets.\n\nBut Zelensky has called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further -- including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.\n\nThe United States on Wednesday also announced an important step to bolster NATO's own deterrence against Russia in Europe by saying it would begin \"episodic deployments\" of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026.\n\nThe White House said it would eventually look to permanently station them in Germany, and the missiles would \"have significantly longer range\" than current US systems in Europe.\n\nThe Kremlin on Thursday struck back, saying it was planning \"response measures\" to contain the \"very serious threat\" from NATO, accusing the alliance of being \"fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine.\"\n\nThe leader of NATO member Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said that any possibility of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO was \"worrying.\"\n\n\"Any steps that could lead to this outcome should be consciously avoided,\" said the Turkish leader, one of the few NATO members to have maintained ties with Russia since the invasion.\n\nAmid worries by key allies of drawing the alliance closer to war, NATO's leaders on Wednesday once again demurred from issuing Ukraine a clear invitation to join their alliance.\n\nZelensky unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at a summit in Lithuania last year by lambasting NATO's reluctance on membership.\n\nIn a bid to soften any disappointment this time around, NATO leaders called Ukraine's path to membership \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military support \"within the next year.\"", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score":

He also urged cooperation to confront new security threats that transcend geographical boundaries, such as cyber-attacks and conflicts in space.\n\nSouth Korea, Australia and New Zealand, which along with Japan are known as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP4), are also attending the meeting with NATO leaders.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told Reuters this week that he planned to discuss the threat Pyongyang poses to Europe by deepening its Russia ties.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a mutual defense pledge with Russia last month during President Vladimir Putin's first visit to Pyongyang in 24 years, and expressed his \"full support\" for Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have accused Pyongyang of providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells that Russia has used in its war in Ukraine and say they fear Moscow in return could provide support for North Korea's nuclear missile development.\n\nWashington has also said China is supplying drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools to Russia, items which fall short of lethal assistance but are helping Moscow build its military to sustain the Ukraine war. Beijing has said it has not provided any weaponry to any party.\n\nWithout naming China, Kishida told Reuters \"some countries\" have allegedly transferred dual-use civilian-military goods to Russia, which has served \"as a lifeline\" for its Ukraine war.\n\n\"The geographical boundary of 'Euro-Atlantic' or 'Indo-Pacific' is no longer relevant in safeguarding global peace and security. Japan and Indo-Pacific partners can play a great role for NATO allies from this perspective.\"\n\nConstrained by decades of pacifism, Tokyo has been reluctant to supply lethal aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt has, however, provided financial aid to Kyiv, spearheaded efforts to prepare for its post-war reconstruction, and contributed to NATO's fund to provide Ukraine with non-lethal equipment such as anti-drone detection systems.\n\nTokyo has also repeatedly warned about the risks of a similar conflict emerging in East Asia, where China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance towards its territorial claims including the democratic island of Taiwan.\n\n\"This summit is a critical opportunity for Japan, the U.S., and the other NATO allies to confront the ongoing challenges against the international order and to reaffirm values and principles that have shaped global peace and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nThere may be limits, however, over how far NATO members are prepared to go in forging closer ties in Asia. A plan that surfaced last year for NATO to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, was blocked by France and criticized by China.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news",

It will provide a fresh chance for him to prove to the American public that he's capable of serving another four years after his shocking debate flop threw the future of his presidency into doubt.\n\nThe flurry of final events at the NATO summit come a day after NATO labeled China a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war against Ukraine. China in turn accused NATO of seeking security at the expense of others and it has warned the military alliance not to bring the same \"chaos\" to Asia.\n\n\"We appreciate the close partnership with your country, and not least because our security is not regional, it is global,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said as he welcomed South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the last day of the alliance's summit in Washington.\n\n\"This is clearly illustrated by the war in Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is also taking part in the talks, said it was important to draw all partners into a conversation on how to ensure stability, notably as China strengthens its ties with Russia, but also in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\"China is supporting a Russia in the name of this unlimited friendship. (North) Korea is one of the most important suppliers of raw material to Russia,\" he told reporters. He noted that maritime border tensions \"in the Indo-Pacific puts a threat to the stability of the whole region.\"\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea are notably taking part in the summit.\n\nZelenskky will join allied leaders later for a NATO-Ukraine Council, a forum set up a year ago for the 32 allies and Kyiv to meet on an equal footing to share concerns and information.\n\nOn Wednesday, NATO leaders promised Ukraine that it is on an \"irreversible path\" to membership, although it can only join sometime after the war, when the allies agree that it has met all the conditions.\n\nA missile attack on Ukraine's biggest children's hospital on the eve of the summit in Washington, to mark NATO's 75th anniversary, underscored that Russian President Vladimir Putin may not be ready to make peace for some time.\n\nMany allies also offered more military support, and NATO launched a new program to underwrite deliveries of military equipment and coordinate training for Ukraine's beleaguered armed forces.

the defence industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade\".\n\nBeijing has denied claims it is aiding Russia's fighting in Ukraine and insisted it won't accept \"criticism or pressure\" over its ties with Moscow.\n\nAnd on Thursday, its foreign ministry accused the alliance of \"prejudice, smearing and provocation\".\n\n\"NATO's rhetoric about China's responsibility in Ukraine is unjustified and malicious,\" spokesman Lin Jian said.\n\n\"We urge NATO to reflect on the root causes of the crisis and its own actions, listen carefully to the just voice

It opened Tuesday in the American capital, Washington, D.C.\n\nLeaders from Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand are attending the NATO leaders' meeting for the third straight year. Australia sent its deputy prime minister.\n\nExpert say China will follow the three-day meeting closely to measure NATO's interest in places beyond Europe and the Western Hemisphere.\n\nChina and Russia have strengthened ties recently as Russia's war in Ukraine continues. In the Pacific area, North Korea has increased support for Russia while South Korea has sided with NATO allies.\n\nLast week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke at the Brookings Institution in Washington. He said: \"...Partners in Europe see challenges halfway around the world in Asia as being relevant to them, just as partners in Asia see challenges halfway around the world in Europe as being relevant to them.\"\n\nCountries with shared security interests appear to be strengthening ties. They see the competition between the United States and China as growing. U.S. officials are concerned about China's efforts to challenge the U.S.-led \"world order.\" China considers its rise inevitable and that U.S. concerns come from the Cold War competition of the past.\n\nChina's foreign ministry criticized NATO's reported interest in deepening its partnerships with Asian nations. At its usual press briefing Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry official said NATO was \"breaching its boundary, expanding its mandate, reaching beyond its defense zone and stoking confrontation...\"\n\nThe war in Ukraine\n\nThe war in Ukraine has placed Russia and its allies against the U.S., Europe and their Asian allies. For example, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the U.S. Congress in April that, \"Ukraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow.\"\n\nIn addition, the U.S. and South Korea have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with ammunition for the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea in June and signed an agreement on joint military assistance.\n\nBoth Japan and South Korea are sending military supplies and aid to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. says China is providing Russia with machine tools, electronics and other technology that can be used to make weapons to use against Ukraine.\n\nA national security advisor to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Yoon will bring \"a strong message regarding the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea.\" The official also said the president would discuss ways to increase cooperation between NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners.\n\nMirna Galic is an expert on China and East Asia at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington. Galic says the partnership between Asian countries and NATO does not make NATO a direct actor in the Indo-Pacific areas. For example, she wrote in an analysis, they can share information and align on actions such as sanctions and aid shipments. But, she continued, they do not intervene in military crises outside of their own areas.\n\nZhu Feng is the dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University in China. He believes China is worried about NATO's interest in the East and wants to be seen as a force for peace.\n\nZhu said, \"NATO should consider China as a positive force for the regional peace and stability and for global security.\" He added, \"We also hope the Ukraine war can end as soon as possible...\"\n\nNATO and China had little conflict until 2019. That year, the NATO summit in London raised China as a \"challenge\" that needed to be dealt with \"together as an alliance.\" Two years later, NATO called China a \"systemic challenge\" and said it was \"cooperating militarily with Russia.\" Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.\n\nAt the Shangri-la Dialogue security meeting in Singapore this year, American Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was asked about the alliance and the Indo-Pacific area.\n\nAustin said the U.S. was working with \"like-minded countries with similar values and a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nChinese Lieutenant General Jing Jianfeng also attended the Shangri-la Dialogue. He told delegates that Western alliances in Asia were an effort to continue what he called \"the hegemony as led by the United States.\"\n\nDidi Tang reported this story for the Associated Press.

He also urged cooperation to confront new security threats that transcend geographical boundaries, such as cyber-attacks and conflicts in space.\n\nSouth Korea, Australia and New Zealand, which along with Japan are known as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP4), are also attending the July 10-11 meeting with NATO leaders.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told Reuters this week that he planned to discuss the threat Pyongyang poses to Europe by deepening its Russia ties.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-Un signed a mutual defence pledge with Russia last month during President Valdimir Putin's first visit to Pyongyang in 24 years, and expressed his \"full support\" for Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have accused Pyongyang of providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells that Russia has used in its war in Ukraine and say they fear Moscow in return could provide support for North Korea's nuclear missile development.\n\nWashington has also said China is supplying drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools to Russia, items which fall short of lethal assistance but are helping Moscow build its military to sustain the Ukraine war. Beijing has said it has not provided any weaponry to any party.\n\nWithout naming China, Kishida told Reuters \"some countries\" have allegedly transferred dual-use civilian-military goods to Russia which has served \"as a lifeline\" for its Ukraine war.\n\n\"It is necessary to grapple with such situations in a multi-faceted and strategic manner, taking a panoramic view that considers the full range of international actors fuelling Russia's attempt to change the status quo by force,\" he said.\n\n\"The geographical boundary of 'Euro-Atlantic' or 'Indo-Pacific' is no longer relevant in safeguarding global peace and security. Japan and Indo-Pacific partners can play a great role for NATO allies from this perspective.\"\n\nConstrained by decades of pacifism, Tokyo has been reluctant to supply lethal aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt has, however, provided financial aid to Kyiv, spearheaded efforts to prepare for its post-war reconstruction, and contributed to NATO's fund to provide Ukraine with non-lethal equipment such as anti-drone detection systems.\n\nTokyo has also repeatedly warned about the risks of a similar conflict emerging in East Asia, where China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance towards its territorial claims including the democratic island of Taiwan.\n\n\"This summit is a critical opportunity for Japan, the U.S., and the other NATO allies to confront the ongoing challenges against the international order and to reaffirm values and principles that have shaped global peace and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nThere may be limits, however, over how far NATO members are prepared to go in forging closer ties in Asia. A plan that surfaced last year for NATO to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, was blocked by France and criticised by China.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Franz\n\nJoining this week's meeting of NATO leaders in Washington will be some countries far from Europe or North America - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nWho is coming and what is the link between NATO, which was founded to help the North Atlantic region counter the threat from the Soviet Union, and countries in Asia and the Pacific?\n\nWhich Indo-Pacific leaders will attend?\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles are all attending.\n\nThis is the third successive NATO summit for the countries, referred to as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP-4). They are due to hold a session with NATO and EU leaders on Thursday amid rising concerns that China might attack Taiwan and worries about Russia's stepped-up security ties with China and nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration has worked to strengthen ties in the Indo-Pacific, including with India, and has been disappointed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow just ahead of the NATO meeting, which he will not attend.\n\nAustralian Prime Minster Anthony Albanese also will not be at the summit, given domestic political priorities.\n\nWhat is behind NATO's interest in the region?\n\nUS allies globally are increasingly aligned in their opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine, and Moscow's \"no limits\" partnership with China, which is helping to reconstitute the Russian military.\n\nIn 2022, NATO members identified China as a potential threat for the first time. At the 2023 NATO summit in Vilnius, they condemned China and Russia for \"their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order,\" and warned about Beijing's \"coercive tactics\" to divide the Alliance.\n\nA draft of the Washington summit statement called China a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's Ukraine war effort and said Beijing poses systemic challenges to Europe and to security.\n\nIt stressed the importance of the Indo-Pacific to NATO, saying developments there directly affect Euro-Atlantic security, and welcomed enhanced cooperation with Asia-Pacific partners to support Ukraine.\n\nUS national security advisor Jake Sullivan said the NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners would launch four new joint projects - on Ukraine, artificial intelligence, disinformation, and cybersecurity.\n\nBut while the Biden administration pushed for European allies to pay more attention to the Indo-Pacific after Biden took office in 2021, talk with Indo-Pacific countries this time will likely be more about how they can help Ukraine's war effort.\n\nWhat steps have NATO members taken in the Indo-Pacific?\n\nRecent years have seen some stepped up European engagement in the Indo-Pacific, notably Britain's involvement with the US in the AUKUS project to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.\n\nHowever, most European defense engagement in Asia has been ad hoc and modest, involving occasional patrols or exercises by small visiting forces. Many NATO allies and Indo-Pacific countries do not want to see the alliance expanding its remit beyond the North Atlantic theater.\n\nA proposal to establish a NATO liaison office in Tokyo, which angered China, was blocked by France last year.\n\nWhat is next for NATO involvement in the region?\n\nSome analysts contend that Europe's NATO members must boost their ability to deal with European security challenges to enable the US to focus on Asia and threats posed by China, including the dispute over Taiwan, the democratic island Beijing claims as its territory.\n\nChristopher Johnstone, a former senior official in Biden's National Security Council, said the biggest contribution Europe could make was \"to ensure that it is prepared to shoulder the burden of deterrence against the Russian threat in the event of a Taiwan or other contingency in the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nNATO has touted efforts by members to meet defense spending goals of 2% of GDP, but analysts say that decades of low spending have left most countries unable to play any meaningful role the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"There's nothing (NATO countries) can really do that would make a material difference,\" in an Indo-Pacific conflict, said Elbridge Colby, a former Pentagon official in the Trump administration.\n\nColby said most European militaries would be reliant on the US for basic logistics.\n\n\"It's entirely possible that their contribution would be a net negative,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Republican candidate Donald Trump, 78, has questioned U.S. support for allies and the amount of aid given to Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will also hold a news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg after a two-hour session with NATO leaders, as well as meetings with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader, keen to cement ties with U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle in the event that Trump is reelected, met with congressional leaders involved in defense, spending, diplomacy and national security.\n\nHe told reporters he invited Mike Johnson, the Republican leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, to visit Kyiv.\n\nMESSAGE TO RUSSIA\n\nIn a clear warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the United States said on Wednesday it would start deploying longer range missiles in Germany in 2026, the most potent U.S. weapons to be based on the European continent since the Cold War.\n\nA NATO declaration said the allies would provide at least 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military aid to Ukraine within the next year, although they stopped short of the multi-year commitment Stoltenberg had sought. NATO members also pledged to continue to support Ukraine \"on its irreversible path to full Euro-atlantic integration, including NATO membership\".\n\nGreeting South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday, Stoltenberg said Russia's closer cooperation with North Korea showed how European and Indo-Pacific security were interlinked.\n\nHe referred to what NATO says is North Korea's supply of munitions to Russia for the war in Ukraine and said NATO was \"deeply concerned about the possibility of Russia in return delivering support to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.\"\n\nYoon said the closer military and economic ties between Moscow and Pyongyang were a \"stark reminder of the fact that the European security and the Indo-Pacific security are indivisible\" and said Thursday's meeting would further strengthen ties between the Indo-Pacific and NATO states.\n\nThe NATO summit declaration\n\nsharply criticized China\n\n, calling it a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war effort in Ukraine and saying Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security.\n\nNATO and the four Indo-Pacific countries are set to launch new joint projects at the summit - on Ukraine, artificial intelligence, disinformation, and cybersecurity.\n\nEMBATTLED BIDEN\n\nBiden, who will host the session event on Ukraine, has argued that NATO is \"stronger than it's ever been\" and that Ukraine can and will stop Russian leader Putin \"with our full, collective support\".\n\nThe increasingly embattled U.S. president on Wednesday met with new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finland's President Alexander Stubb.\n\nWhile Biden has been seeking to rally allies and Democratic voters, several high-ranking European officials met a top foreign policy adviser to Trump during the summit.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he would not pull the U.S. out of NATO but reiterated that he wanted members to pay more. \"I just want them to pay their bills. We're protecting Europe. They take advantage of us very badly,\" he said.\n\nTrump had pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine before later reversing course earlier this year.\n\nZelenskiy urged U.S. political leaders on Tuesday not to wait for the outcome of the U.S. election before moving forcefully to help Ukraine and called for fewer restrictions on the use of U.S. weaponry.

He also urged cooperation to confront new security threats that transcend geographical boundaries, such as cyber-attacks and conflicts in space.\n\nSouth Korea, Australia and New Zealand, which along with Japan are known as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP4), are also attending the July 10-11 meeting with NATO leaders.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told Reuters this week that he planned to discuss the threat Pyongyang poses to Europe by deepening its Russia ties.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-Un signed a mutual defense pledge with Russia last month during President Valdimir Putin's first visit to Pyongyang in 24 years, and expressed his \"full support\" for Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe US and its allies have accused Pyongyang of providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells that Russia has used in its war in Ukraine and say they fear Moscow in return could provide support for North Korea's nuclear missile development.\n\nWashington has also said China is supplying drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools to Russia, items which fall short of lethal assistance but are helping Moscow build its military to sustain the Ukraine war. Beijing has said it has not provided any weaponry to any party.\n\nWithout naming China, Kishida told Reuters \"some countries\" have allegedly transferred dual-use civilian-military goods to Russia which has served \"as a lifeline\" for its Ukraine war.\n\n\"It is necessary to grapple with such situations in a multi-faceted and strategic manner, taking a panoramic view that considers the full range of international actors fueling Russia's attempt to change the status quo by force,\" he said.\n\n\"The geographical boundary of 'Euro-Atlantic' or 'Indo-Pacific' is no longer relevant in safeguarding global peace and security. Japan and Indo-Pacific partners can play a great role for NATO allies from this perspective.\"\n\nConstrained by decades of pacifism, Tokyo has been reluctant to supply lethal aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt has, however, provided financial aid to Kyiv, spearheaded efforts to prepare for its post-war reconstruction, and contributed to NATO's fund to provide Ukraine with non-lethal equipment such as anti-drone detection systems.\n\nTokyo has also repeatedly warned about the risks of a similar conflict emerging in East Asia, where China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance towards its territorial claims including the democratic island of Taiwan.\n\n\"This summit is a critical opportunity for Japan, the US, and the other NATO allies to confront the ongoing challenges against the international order and to reaffirm values and principles that have shaped global peace and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nThere may be limits, however, over how far NATO members are prepared to go in forging closer ties in Asia. A plan that surfaced last year for NATO to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, was blocked by France and criticized by China.", "source": {"uri": "thejakartapost.com", "dataType":

It will provide a fresh chance for him to prove to the American public that he's capable of serving another four years after his shocking debate flop threw the future of his presidency into doubt.\n\nThe flurry of final events at the NATO summit come a day after NATO labeled China a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war against Ukraine. China in turn accused NATO of seeking security at the expense of others and it has warned the military alliance not to bring the same \"chaos\" to Asia.\n\n\"We appreciate the close partnership with your country, and not least because our security is not regional, it is global,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said as he welcomed South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the last day of the alliance's summit in Washington.\n\n\"This is clearly illustrated by the war in Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is also taking part in the talks, said it was important to draw all partners into a conversation on how to ensure stability, notably as China strengthens its ties with Russia, but also in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\"China is supporting a Russia in the name of this unlimited friendship. (North) Korea is one of the most important suppliers of raw material to Russia,\" he told reporters. He noted that maritime border tensions \"in the Indo-Pacific puts a threat to the stability of the whole region.\"\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea are notably taking part in the summit.\n\nZelenskky will join allied leaders later for a NATO-Ukraine Council, a forum set up a year ago for the 32 allies and Kyiv to meet on an equal footing to share concerns and information.\n\nOn Wednesday, NATO leaders promised Ukraine that it is on an \"irreversible path\" to membership, although it can only join sometime after the war, when the allies agree that it has met all the conditions.\n\nA missile attack on Ukraine's biggest children's hospital on the eve of the summit in Washington, to mark NATO's 75th anniversary, underscored that Russian President Vladimir Putin may not be ready to make peace for some time.\n\nMany allies also offered more military support, and NATO launched a new program to underwrite deliveries of military equipment and coordinate training for Ukraine's beleaguered armed forces. NATO members also committed to keep up current levels of military aid -- about 40 billion euros ($43.5 billion) annually -- for at least a year.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

They also declared that Ukraine is on an \"irreversible path\" to joining NATO.\n\nThe commitment was made at the current NATO summit in Washington, DC. Simultaneously, the alliance's members also announced various individual and joint measures to enhance the security of Ukraine and Europe.\n\nNotably, the US, Netherlands, and Denmark will provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets by this summer. Additionally, the US is said to deploy longer-range missiles in Germany by 2026 to counter Russia's threat to Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for NATO's efforts to strengthen Ukraine's air force, stating that the new fighter jets bring a \"just and lasting peace\" closer and show that terrorism must fail.\n\nIt was reported that NATO had met most of Zelenskyy's requests, including providing dozens of air defence systems.\n\nThe US will supply Ukraine with four Patriot missile systems, and other NATO members will help maintain these systems; however, Ukraine's membership in NATO is still pending.\n\nWhile Ukraine has received the much-anticipated and sought military Aid, it still has a few steps to clear before it is given NATO membership.\n\nAccording to NATO's communique, \"Ukraine's future is in NATO,\" it promised continued support for Ukraine's integration into the Euro-Atlantic community, including eventual NATO membership.\n\nHowever, it stated that the invitation to join would only be extended when all Allies agreed and certain conditions were met.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg emphasized that Ukraine will join NATO after the war ends to ensure Russia does not attack Kyiv again. He went on to clarify that NATO's goal is to end the war as soon as possible, not to prolong it.\n\nThe US and some other countries have opposed Ukraine joining NATO during its conflict with Russia to prevent escalating tensions that could lead to a larger war.\n\nAt the same time, they also emphasized that Ukraine needs to tackle corruption and implement other major reforms.\n\nNATO And Chinese Concern\n\nNATO's statement has also taken a tougher stance on China, calling it a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war in Ukraine and highlighting that Beijing continues to pose challenges to Euro-Atlantic security.\n\nAlthough NATO doesn't impose sanctions, Stoltenberg noted that individual countries might take action based on the summit's clear stance.\n\nAdditional Concerns\n\nAnother concern that has surfaced concerns Donald Trump's potential impact on NATO if he wins the upcoming election.\n\nThe same surfaced due to President Joe Biden's capabilities following a debate gaffe; additionally, Stoltenberg defended NATO, pointing out that the US criticism has been about allies not investing enough in NATO, a situation that has improved recently.\n\nHowever, Trump clarified on Fox News Radio that he doesn't want the US to leave NATO but wants other countries to fulfil their financial commitments.\n\nMeanwhile, President Biden emphasized NATO's importance while hosting the North Atlantic Council in Washington, DC. He noted that since he took office, military spending has increased and the number of battle groups on NATO's eastern flank has doubled.\n\n\"We can and will defend every inch of NATO territory, and we will do it together,\" Biden said.\n\nThe summit, which included leaders from the 32 NATO countries and Pacific partners like Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Ukraine, might be one of Biden's last international appearances before the US election. With the election approaching, Biden's political challenges were a significant backdrop to the gathering.\n\nFormer US Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs PJ Crowley pointed out that NATO leaders are concerned about Biden's ability to lead as he has played a crucial role in making NATO central to American security policy. Crowley also noted that while the promises made at the summit are crucial for Ukraine, their impact might be limited if Trump, who is skeptical of alliances like NATO, wins the election.\n\nCrowley emphasized the importance of Aid to Ukraine, stating that Ukraine must be supported and its sovereignty protected. He suggested that Trump might push for negotiations to end the conflict if he becomes president.\n\nRussia's Response\n\nRussian media have downplayed the unity shown at the NATO summit, focusing on President Biden's suitability for office.\n\nThe state-run tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets described Biden as \"close to senility\" and out of touch with reality, framing his pledge to defend Ukraine as an attempt to salvage his presidential campaign.\n\nCoverage in Russia stressed the obstacles Ukraine faces in joining NATO, with Polish President Andrzej Duda's comments that accession can't happen until the conflict ends being particularly noted.\n\nThe TV show 60 Minutes described these remarks as a \"cold shower\" for Zelenskyy.\n\nDespite the dismissive tone, the extensive coverage suggests underlying concern in Russia. The Kremlin is aware that Zelenskyy will likely secure more military Aid from the summit, which could pose significant challenges for Russia.\n\nAn anonymous NATO official quoted by Reuters mentioned that Russia is suffering heavy losses and lacks the resources for a major offensive, implying that additional weapons for Ukraine could worsen these problems.\n\nHowever, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow will \"closely monitor\" the summit's outcomes.\n\nPoland Must Prepare For War\n\nPoland must prepare its soldiers for a \"full-scale conflict,\" according to its armed forces chief of staff, General Wieslaw Kukula who emphasized the need to balance army training with border security.\n\nThe number of troops on Poland's eastern border will increase from 6,000 to 8,000 by August. General Kukula stated, \"Today, we need to prepare our forces for full-scale conflict, not an asymmetric-type conflict.\"\n\nIn May, Poland announced \"East Shield,\" a $2.5 billion program to strengthen defences along its border with Belarus and Russia. This comes as Belarus and China conducted military drills near the Polish border.\n\nThe border with Belarus has been a flashpoint since 2021 when migrants began arriving there. Belarus had opened travel agencies in the Middle East, offering a new unofficial route into Europe, which the European Union claimed was an attempt to create a crisis.\n\nAs of the end of last year, the Polish armed forces had about 190,000 personnel. Poland plans to increase this number to 300,000 troops within a few years.", "source": {"uri": "inventiva.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inventiva"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

boosts Asia ties in face of China, Zelensky attends", "body": "Prime Minister of New Zealand Christopher Luxon (L), South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol (3L), Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (3R) and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (R) appear on a White House after a NATO welcoming ceremony\n\nNATO leaders on Thursday looked to bolster ties with Asian partners after slamming China as a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war, before holding talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky at the end of a summit in Washington.\n\nThe 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled set piece in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Moscow and backing for Kyiv.\n\nThe three-day gathering has been overshadowed by political uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden -- who will give a press conference Thursday -- fights for his own political survival.\n\nAfter spending the bulk of the summit focused on bolstering Ukraine, NATO shifted attention eastwards by welcoming the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nA strongly-worded declaration from NATO released Wednesday called Beijing a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its supplies of dual-use goods such as microchips that can help Moscow's military.\n\nChina \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" NATO leaders said.\n\nBeijing hit back by warning NATO to \"stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry.\"\n\nChina presents itself as a neutral party in the conflict, but it has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nThe United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the challenges posed by China.\n\nThe Washington summit is the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.\n\nDiplomats said several initiatives with the partner countries were due to be announced, including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation, and providing Ukraine non-lethal help.\n\nBut the Pacific leaders' presence is more about signaling NATO's greater interest in the region at a time of growing competition between Washington and Beijing.\n\n- US missiles, Kremlin warning - More from this section Nigel Farage 'will be our Jeremy Corbyn' if brought into Tory fold, says Jonathan Gullis Veganish CT Cafe opens in Bridgeport When Diet, Exercise Delay Diabetes Diagnosis, Long-term Health Improves\n\nAfter that sit-down, Ukraine's Zelensky will take center stage at the giant convention center in the heart of the US capital.\n\nHe will join his NATO counterparts after getting promises of new air defences for Ukraine and as Kyiv gets closer to finally receiving long-promised F-16 jets.\n\nBut Zelensky has called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further -- including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.\n\nThe United States on Wednesday also announced an important step to bolster NATO's own deterrence against Russia in Europe by saying it would begin \"episodic deployments\" of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026.\n\nThe White House said it would eventually look to permanently station them in Germany, and the missiles would \"have significantly longer range\" than current US systems in Europe.\n\nThe Kremlin on Thursday struck back, saying it was planning \"response measures\" to contain the \"very serious threat\" from NATO, accusing the alliance of being \"fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine.\"\n\nThe leader of NATO member Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said that any possibility of a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO was \"worrying.\"\n\n\"Any steps that could lead to this outcome should be consciously avoided,\" said the Turkish leader, one of the few NATO members to have maintained ties with Russia since the invasion.\n\nAmid worries by key allies of drawing the alliance closer to war, NATO's leaders on Wednesday once again demurred from issuing Ukraine a clear invitation to join their alliance.\n\nZelensky unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at a summit in Lithuania last year by lambasting NATO's reluctance on membership.\n\nIn a bid to soften any disappointment this time around, NATO leaders called Ukraine's path to membership \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military support \"within the next year.\"\n\ndel/mlm", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_delany@reformer.com", "name":

NATO's Asia Pacific strategy has damaged China's interests, he said and urged it to stop interfering in its internal affairs.\n\nChina will firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, he said. The NATO Washington summit has made scathing criticism of Beijing, saying China has \"become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its so-called no limits partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base.\n\nAlso, China's military exercises with Belarus, a close ally of Russia, were sharply criticised by NATO especially since they are being held close to the border of Poland, a NATO member. Next to Russia, China appears to have become a centerpiece of NATO's criticism which comes at a time when Beijing is trying to scale down trade tariffs and sanctions, especially for its electric vehicles which it is trying to market in the EU to reduce its overcapacity.\n\nThe NATO alliance comprised 32 member states, 30 European and two North American countries including the US and UK. Chinese analysts have also been airing concerns over China getting involved in the Ukraine war risking its political and trade ties with the EU and confrontation with the powerful NATO alliance.\n\nChina is also trying to deflect criticism for supplying materials related to weapons production to Russia. The NATO declaration said, We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort.\n\n\"This includes the transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment, and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia's defence sector. The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation, the NATO declaration said.\n\nLin also tried to play down strong EU and NATO criticism of Chinese troops taking part in joint military exercises with Belarus near the Polish border, saying that it is normal military cooperation, and does not target any specific country. Poland reportedly expressed its concern to China as the exercises are close to comfort and the Polish border is also formally referred to as the borders of NATO as Poland is a member of the organisation.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charter of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/11-07-2024/1200-675-21926121-1029-21926121-1720700803633.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717162", "eventUri": "eng-9717162", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein\n\nBy Andrea Shalal and Idrees Ali\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -NATO leaders will conclude their Washington summit on Thursday with a clear focus on backing Ukraine and countering what the allies say is the growing threat Russia poses to Europe, as U.S. President Joe Biden faces growing calls from members of his Democratic party to drop his re-election bid.\n\nBefore a summit session devoted to Ukraine, the 32 NATO countries and EU leaders will meet with partners from the so-called Indo-Pacific Four - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea - for discussions expected to focus on perceived threats posed by China and Russia to both regions.\n\nBiden, 81, will hold a rare solo news conference in the afternoon, where reporters are certain to question his candidacy in the Nov. 5 presidential election, despite his hope to shift the narrative, surrounded by allied leaders he has spent his three years in office cultivating.\n\nBiden's uneven performance in a June 27 debate against Trump and low public approval ratings have raised fresh doubts about his mental fitness, with nine Democratic members of Congress and one Democratic senator calling for him to step aside.\n\nEuropean leaders worry that November's U.S. presidential election could yield a sharp change in Washington's support for Ukraine and NATO. Republican candidate Donald Trump, 78, has questioned U.S. support for allies and the amount of aid given to Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will also hold a news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg after a two-hour session with NATO leaders, as well as meetings with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader, keen to cement ties with U.S. lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle in the event that Trump is reelected, met with congressional leaders involved in defense, spending, diplomacy and national security.\n\nHe told reporters he invited Mike Johnson, the Republican leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, to visit Kyiv.\n\nMESSAGE TO RUSSIA\n\nIn a clear warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the United States said on Wednesday it would start deploying longer range missiles in Germany in 2026, the most potent U.S. weapons to be based on the European continent since the Cold War.\n\nA NATO declaration said the allies would provide at least 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military aid to Ukraine within the next year, although they stopped short of the multi-year commitment Stoltenberg had sought. NATO members also pledged to continue to support Ukraine \"on its irreversible path to full Euro-atlantic integration, including NATO membership\".\n\nGreeting South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday, Stoltenberg said Russia's closer cooperation with North Korea showed how European and Indo-Pacific security were interlinked.\n\nHe referred to what NATO says is North Korea's supply of munitions to Russia for the war in Ukraine and said NATO was \"deeply concerned about the possibility of Russia in return delivering support to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.\"\n\nYoon said the closer military and economic ties between Moscow and Pyongyang were a \"stark reminder of the fact that the European security and the Indo-Pacific security are indivisible\" and said Thursday's meeting would further strengthen ties between the Indo-Pacific and NATO states.\n\nThe NATO summit declaration sharply criticized China, calling it a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war effort in Ukraine and saying Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security.\n\nNATO and the four Indo-Pacific countries are set to launch new joint projects at the summit - on Ukraine, artificial intelligence, disinformation, and cybersecurity.\n\nEMBATTLED BIDEN\n\nBiden, who will host the session event on Ukraine, has argued that NATO is \"stronger than it's ever been\" and that Ukraine can and will stop Russian leader Putin \"with our full, collective support\".\n\nThe increasingly embattled U.S. president on Wednesday met with new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Finland's President Alexander Stubb.\n\nWhile Biden has been seeking to rally allies and Democratic voters, several high-ranking European officials met a top foreign policy adviser to Trump during the summit.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he would not pull the U.S. out of NATO but reiterated that he wanted members to pay more. \"I just want them to pay their bills. We're protecting Europe. They take advantage of us very badly,\" he said.\n\nTrump had pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine before later reversing course earlier this year.\n\nZelenskiy urged U.S. political leaders on Tuesday not to wait for the outcome of the U.S. election before moving forcefully to help Ukraine and called for fewer restrictions on the use of U.S. weaponry.\n\n(Reporting

He also urged cooperation to confront new security threats that transcend geographical boundaries, such as cyber-attacks and conflicts in space.\n\nSouth Korea, Australia and New Zealand, which along with Japan are known as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP4), are also attending the meeting with NATO leaders.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told Reuters this week that he planned to discuss the threat Pyongyang poses to Europe by deepening its Russia ties.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a mutual defense pledge with Russia last month during President Vladimir Putin's first visit to Pyongyang in 24 years, and expressed his 'full support' for Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have accused Pyongyang of providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells that Russia has used in its war in Ukraine and say they fear Moscow in return could provide support for North Korea's nuclear missile development.\n\nWashington has also said China is supplying drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools to Russia, items which fall short of lethal assistance but are helping Moscow build its military to sustain the Ukraine war. Beijing has said it has not provided any weaponry to any party.\n\nWithout naming China, Kishida told Reuters 'some countries' have allegedly transferred dual-use civilian-military goods to Russia, which has served 'as a lifeline' for its Ukraine war.\n\n'The geographical boundary of 'Euro-Atlantic' or 'Indo-Pacific' is no longer relevant in safeguarding global peace and security. Japan and Indo-Pacific partners can play a great role for NATO allies from this perspective.'\n\nConstrained by decades of pacifism, Tokyo has been reluctant to supply lethal aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt has, however, provided financial aid to Kyiv, spearheaded efforts to prepare for its post-war reconstruction, and contributed to NATO's fund to provide Ukraine with non-lethal equipment such as anti-drone detection systems.\n\nTokyo has also repeatedly warned about the risks of a similar conflict emerging in East Asia, where China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance towards its territorial claims including the democratic island of Taiwan.\n\n'This summit is a critical opportunity for Japan, the U.S., and the other NATO allies to confront the ongoing challenges against the international order and to reaffirm values and principles that have shaped global peace and prosperity,' he said.\n\nThere may be limits, however, over how far NATO members are prepared to go in forging closer ties in Asia. A plan that surfaced last year for NATO to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, was blocked by France and criticized by China.\n\nReuters is a news agency founded in 1851 and owned by the Thomson Reuters Corporation based in Toronto, Canada.

The European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China.\n\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Modi Meeting With Austrian Leaders, Including Federal President Alexander Van Der Bellen, To Expand India-Austria Cooperation (Watch Video).\n\nBeijing has denied that it supports Russia's war efforts and insists that it conducts normal trade with its northern neighbour.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, NATO member countries said China has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base.\n\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Modi Urges Austria CEOs To Invest in India's Fast-Growing Economy.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbours and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" read the communiqu\u00e9, which referred to China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\nBeijing has expressed displeasure at NATO's growing interest in Asia and demanded the alliance stay out of the Asia-Pacific region and not incite confrontation.\n\n\"NATO should not use China to justify its insertion into the Asia-Pacific and attempt to disrupt regional dynamics,\" said Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, on Tuesday. \"China is a force for world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order.\"\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea sent their leaders or deputies to the NATO summit in Washington this week. They are partners, not members, of the alliance.\n\nDanny Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for Asia and now vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute, called the new wording by NATO \"an extraordinary step\", particularly since it was coupled with the warning that Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to European interests and security in the same communiqu\u00e9.\n\n\"It is a mark of how badly Beijing's attempt to straddle Russia and Western Europe has failed and how hollow its claim of neutrality rings,\" Russel said. \"China's attempts at divide-and-conquer have instead produced remarkable solidarity between key nations of the Euro-Atlantic and the Asia-Pacific regions.\"\n\nIn Washington, where leaders of NATO nations are convening this week to mark the coalition's 75th anniversary, US President Joe Biden said the alliance must not fall behind Russia, which is ramping up weapon production with the help of China, North Korea and Iran. Jens Stoltenberg, general secretary of NATO, said in his opening remarks that NATO would be enforcing its partnerships in the Indo-Pacific.

They are due to hold a session with NATO and EU leaders on Thursday amid rising concerns that China might attack Taiwan and worries about Russia's stepped-up security ties with China and nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\nUS President Joe Biden's administration has worked to strengthen ties in the Indo-Pacific, including with India, and has been disappointed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow just ahead of the NATO meeting, which he will not attend.\n\nAustralian Prime Minster Anthony Albanese also will not be at the summit, given domestic political priorities.\n\nU.S. allies globally are increasingly aligned in their opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine, and Moscow's \"no limits\" partnership with China, which is helping to reconstitute the Russian military.\n\nIn 2022, NATO members identified China as a potential threat for the first time. At the 2023 NATO summit in Vilnius, they condemned China and Russia for \"their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order,\" and warned about Beijing's \"coercive tactics\" to divide the Alliance.\n\nA draft of the Washington summit statement called China a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's Ukraine war effort and said Beijing poses systemic challenges to Europe and to security.\n\nIt stressed the importance of the Indo-Pacific to NATO, saying developments there directly affect Euro-Atlantic security, and welcomed enhanced cooperation with Asia-Pacific partners to support Ukraine.\n\nUS national security advisor Jake Sullivan said the NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners would launch four new joint projects - on Ukraine, artificial intelligence, disinformation, and cybersecurity.\n\nBut while the Biden administration pushed for European allies to pay more attention to the Indo-Pacific after Biden took office in 2021, talk with Indo-Pacific countries this time will likely be more about how they can help Ukraine's war effort.\n\nRecent years have seen some stepped up European engagement in the Indo-Pacific, notably Britain's involvement with the U.S. in the AUKUS project to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.\n\nHowever, most European defense engagement in Asia has been ad hoc and modest, involving occasional patrols or exercises by small visiting forces. Many NATO allies and Indo-Pacific countries do not want to see the alliance expanding its remit beyond the North Atlantic theater.\n\nA proposal to establish a NATO liaison office in Tokyo, which angered China, was blocked by France last year.\n\nSome analysts contend that Europe's NATO members must boost their ability to deal with European security challenges to enable the U.S. to focus on Asia and threats posed by China, including the dispute over Taiwan, the democratic island Beijing claims as its territory.\n\nChristopher Johnstone, a former senior official in Biden's National Security Council, said the biggest contribution Europe could make was \"to ensure that it is prepared to shoulder the burden of deterrence against the Russian threat in the event of a Taiwan or other contingency in the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nNATO has touted efforts by members to meet defense spending goals of 2% of GDP, but analysts say that decades of low spending have left most countries unable to play any meaningful role the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"There's nothing (NATO countries) can really do that would make a material difference,\" in an Indo-Pacific conflict, said Elbridge Colby, a former Pentagon official in the Trump administration.\n\nColby said most European militaries would be reliant on the U.S. for basic logistics.\n\n\"It's entirely possible that their contribution would be a net negative,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific",

The Ukrainian leader is also scheduled to meet U.S. President Joe Biden during the day.\n\nThe meetings come a day after Zelenskiy met with leaders of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and members of committees involved in defense, spending, diplomacy, and national security.\n\nZelenskiy is expected to ask NATO to move more forcefully to aid his country against Russia's invasion and to speed up pledges of aid. He told a Washington think tank audience early this week that it's \"time to step out of the shadows, to make strong decisions.\"\n\nZelenskiy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, will kick off a public forum on the sidelines of the summit on July 11.\n\nYermak is scheduled to speak on the NATO-Ukraine partnership. Among the topics he is expected to address are the summit declaration, which says the allies intend to provide Ukraine with at least $43 billion in military aid within the next year, but stops short of the multiyear commitment Stoltenberg had sought.\n\nThe document also strengthens NATO's language on China, calling it a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war effort in Ukraine and saying Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to transatlantic security.\n\nStoltenberg told reporters it was the first time the 32 allies had jointly labeled China in those terms and called it an important message.\n\nChina's support for Russia's war in Ukraine has heightened NATO's interests in forming bonds with four Indo-Pacific countries -- Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea -- whose leaders will meet with NATO leaders on July 11 to discuss security challenges and cooperation.\n\nStoltenberg highlighted the meeting in his news conference on July 10, telling reporters that the NATO leaders agreed to continue to strengthen their partnerships especially in the Indo Pacific amid rising concerns that China might attack Taiwan and worries about Russia's stepped-up security ties with China and nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\n\"In this dangerous world friends and partners are more important than ever, so today we agreed to continue to strengthen our partnerships especially in the Indo Pacific. Security is global it's not regional. [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war is fueled by those who do not share our values,\" he said.\n\nIran and North Korea are providing direct military support, while China is propping up Russia's war economy, he added.\n\n\"This is not just a temporary coalition of convenience. It is a major strategic shift, and we must remain clear-eyed as to the threat.\"\n\nThis is the third successive NATO summit that the four Indo-Pacific countries have attended. Their meeting with NATO leaders will also be attended by EU leaders.\n\nThe Washington summit declaration stresses the importance of the Indo-Pacific to NATO, saying developments there directly affect Euro-Atlantic security, and welcomed enhanced cooperation with Asia-Pacific partners to support Ukraine.\n\nU.S. national-security adviser Jake Sullivan, who will address the forum running parallel to the summit on July 11, said the NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners would launch four new joint projects at the summit, covering Ukraine, artificial intelligence, disinformation, and cybersecurity.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy",

He also urged cooperation to confront new security threats that transcend geographical boundaries, such as cyber-attacks and conflicts in space.\n\nSouth Korea, Australia and New Zealand, which along with Japan are known as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP4), are also attending the July 10-11 meeting with NATO leaders.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told Reuters this week that he planned to discuss the threat Pyongyang poses to Europe by deepening its Russia ties.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-Un signed a mutual defence pledge with Russia last month during President Valdimir Putin's first visit to Pyongyang in 24 years, and expressed his \"full support\" for Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have accused Pyongyang of providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells that Russia has used in its war in Ukraine and say they fear Moscow in return could provide support for North Korea's nuclear missile development.\n\nWashington has also said China is supplying drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools to Russia, items which fall short of lethal assistance but are helping Moscow build its military to sustain the Ukraine war. Beijing has said it has not provided any weaponry to any party.\n\nWithout naming China, Kishida told Reuters \"some countries\" have allegedly transferred dual-use civilian-military goods to Russia which has served \"as a lifeline\" for its Ukraine war.\n\n\"It is necessary to grapple with such situations in a multi-faceted and strategic manner, taking a panoramic view that considers the full range of international actors fuelling Russia's attempt to change the status quo by force,\" he said.\n\n\"The geographical boundary of 'Euro-Atlantic' or 'Indo-Pacific' is no longer relevant in safeguarding global peace and security. Japan and Indo-Pacific partners can play a great role for NATO allies from this perspective.\"\n\nConstrained by decades of pacifism, Tokyo has been reluctant to supply lethal aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt has, however, provided financial aid to Kyiv, spearheaded efforts to prepare for its post-war reconstruction, and contributed to NATO's fund to provide Ukraine with non-lethal equipment such as anti-drone detection systems.\n\nTokyo has also repeatedly warned about the risks of a similar conflict emerging in East Asia, where China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance towards its territorial claims including the democratic island of Taiwan.\n\n\"This summit is a critical opportunity for Japan, the U.S., and the other NATO allies to confront the ongoing challenges against the international order and to reaffirm values and principles that have shaped global peace and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nThere may be limits, however, over how far NATO members are prepared to go in forging closer ties in Asia. A plan that surfaced last year for NATO to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, was blocked by France and criticised by China.\n\nReporting by Yukiko Toyoda and John Geddie; Editing by

Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" the declaration reads.\n\n\"This includes the transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment, and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia's defence sector.\"\n\nThe declaration includes a veiled threat against the CCP, saying that communist officials in Beijing \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese mission to the European Union issued a statement dismissing the declaration as \"filled with Cold War mentality,\" saying that NATO's concerns about China \"are provocative with obvious lies and smears.\"\n\n\"China provides dual-use equipment, microelectronics, a lot of other tools which are enabling Russia to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons [Russia is] using to attack Ukraine, and the fact that this is now clearly stated, agreed by all NATO allies, is an important message to China,\" Mr. Stoltenberg said.\n\nMr. Stoltenberg also spoke about the need for NATO to engage closely with its Indo-Pacific partners Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea who are concerned about the CCP's aggressive posturing in their backyards.\n\n\"Threats and challenges that China poses to our security is a global challenge,\" he said. \"And the war in Ukraine is perhaps the most obvious example or as the Japanese Prime Minister said several times: What happens in Ukraine today, can happen in Asia tomorrow.\"\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, and Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles are attending this year's NATO summit.\n\nAt the NATO forum, Mr. Blinken put Chinese support for Russia's war effort into numbers.\n\nLuka Ignac, assistant director for the Atlantic Council's Transatlantic Security Initiative, said it is significant that NATO has decided to highlight the \"deepening strategic partnership\" between Russia and China.\n\n\"This statement signals a collective commitment among member states to not only monitor but also actively engage in identifying and implementing measures to mitigate the influence of this partnership.\"", "source": {"uri":

China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard,\" they added.\n\nChina has refused to condemn Russia's invasion and last year released a paper calling for a \"political settlement\" to the conflict, which Western countries said could enable Russia to retain much of the territory it has seized in Ukraine.\n\nChina and Russia's strategic partnership has grown closer since the invasion.\n\nBeijing presents itself as a neutral party in the war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nIt has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nBut that economic partnership has come under close scrutiny from the West in recent months, with Washington vowing to go after financial institutions that facilitate Moscow's war effort.\n\nThe United States and Europe have also accused Beijing of selling components and equipment necessary to keep Moscow's military production afloat.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in April this included \"machine tools, semiconductors, other dual-use items that have helped Russia rebuild the defence industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade\".\n\nBeijing has denied claims it is aiding Russia's fighting in Ukraine and insisted it won't accept \"criticism or pressure\" over its ties with Moscow.\n\nAnd on Thursday, its foreign ministry accused the alliance of \"prejudice, smearing and provocation\".\n\n\"NATO's rhetoric about China's responsibility in Ukraine is unjustified and malicious,\" spokesman Lin Jian said.\n\n\"We urge NATO to reflect on the root causes of the crisis and its own actions, listen carefully to the just voice of the international community, and take concrete actions to ease the situation, instead of shifting the blame to others.\"\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying on Thursday that Russia is planning \"response measures\" to contain the \"very serious threat\" from NATO,\n\nPeskov also said the Western military alliance, which is holding a summit in Washington this week, was now \"fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine\".", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The meeting underscores NATO's growing interest in the Indo-Pacific region amidst concerns over China's actions, including potential threats to Taiwan, and Russia's strengthening ties with Beijing and North Korea.Joining this week's meeting of NATO leaders in Washington will be some countries far from Europe or North America - Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nWho is coming and what is the link between NATO, which was founded to help the North Atlantic region counter the threat from the Soviet Union, and countries in Asia and the Pacific?\n\nWhich Indo-Pacific leaders will attend?\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles are all attending.\n\nThis is the third successive NATO summit for the countries, referred to as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP-4). They are due to hold a session with NATO and EU leaders on Thursday amid rising concerns that China might attack Taiwan and worries about Russia's stepped-up security ties with China and nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration has worked to strengthen ties in the Indo-Pacific, including with India, and has been disappointed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow just ahead of the NATO meeting, which he will not attend.\n\nAustralian Prime Minster Anthony Albanese also will not be at the summit, given domestic political priorities.\n\nWhat is behind NATO's interest in the region?\n\nU.S. allies globally are increasingly aligned in their opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine, and Moscow's \"no limits\" partnership with China, which is helping to reconstitute the Russian military.\n\nIn 2022, NATO members identified China as a potential threat for the first time. At the 2023 NATO summit in Vilnius, they condemned China and Russia for \"their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order,\" and warned about Beijing's \"coercive tactics\" to divide the Alliance.\n\nA draft of the Washington summit statement called China a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's Ukraine war effort and said Beijing poses systemic challenges to Europe and to security.\n\nIt stressed the importance of the Indo-Pacific to NATO, saying developments there directly affect Euro-Atlantic security, and welcomed enhanced cooperation with Asia-Pacific partners to support Ukraine.\n\nU.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan said the NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners would launch four new joint projects - on Ukraine, artificial intelligence, disinformation, and cybersecurity.\n\nBut while the Biden administration pushed for European allies to pay more attention to the Indo-Pacific after Biden took office in 2021, talk with Indo-Pacific countries this time will likely be more about how they can help Ukraine's war effort.\n\nWhat steps have NATO members taken in the Indo-Pacific?\n\nRecent years have seen some stepped up European engagement in the Indo-Pacific, notably Britain's involvement with the U.S. in the AUKUS project to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.\n\nHowever, most European defense engagement in Asia has been ad hoc and modest, involving occasional patrols or exercises by small visiting forces. Many NATO allies and Indo-Pacific countries do not want to see the alliance expanding its remit beyond the North Atlantic theater.\n\nA proposal to establish a NATO liaison office in Tokyo, which angered China, was blocked by France last year.\n\nWhat is next for NATO involvement in the region?\n\nSome analysts contend that Europe's NATO members must boost their ability to deal with European security challenges to enable the U.S. to focus on Asia and threats posed by China, including the dispute over Taiwan, the democratic island Beijing claims as its territory.\n\nChristopher Johnstone, a former senior official in Biden's National Security Council, said the biggest contribution Europe could make was \"to ensure that it is prepared to shoulder the burden of deterrence against the Russian threat in the event of a Taiwan or other contingency in the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nNATO has touted efforts by members to meet defense spending goals of 2% of GDP, but analysts say that decades of low spending have left most countries unable to play any meaningful role the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"There's nothing (NATO countries) can really do that would make a material difference,\" in an

"body": "Joining this week's meeting of NATO leaders in Washington will be some countries far from Europe or North America -- Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nWho is coming and what is the link between NATO, which was founded to help the North Atlantic region counter the threat from the Soviet Union, and countries in Asia and the Pacific?\n\nWhich Indo-Pacific leaders will attend?\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles are all attending.\n\nThis is the third successive NATO summit for the countries, referred to as the Indo-Pacific Four.\n\nThey are due to hold a session with NATO and EU leaders on Thursday amid rising concerns that China might attack Taiwan and worries about Russia's stepped-up security ties with China and nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration has worked to strengthen ties in the Indo-Pacific, including with India, and has been disappointed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow just ahead of the NATO meeting, which he will not attend.\n\nAustralian Prime Minster Anthony Albanese also will not be at the summit, given domestic political priorities.\n\nWhat is behind NATO's interest in the region?\n\nU.S. allies globally are increasingly aligned in their opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine, and Moscow's \"no limits\" partnership with China, which is helping to reconstitute the Russian military.\n\nIn 2022, NATO members identified China as a potential threat for the first time.\n\nAt the 2023 NATO summit in Vilnius, they condemned China and Russia for \"their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order,\" and warned about Beijing's \"coercive tactics\" to divide the Alliance.\n\nA draft of the Washington summit statement called China a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's Ukraine war effort and said Beijing poses systemic challenges to Europe and to security.\n\nIt stressed the importance of the Indo-Pacific to NATO, saying developments there directly affect Euro-Atlantic security, and welcomed enhanced cooperation with Asia-Pacific partners to support Ukraine.\n\nU.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan said the NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners would launch four new joint projects -- on Ukraine, artificial intelligence, disinformation, and cybersecurity.\n\nBut while the Biden administration pushed for European allies to pay more attention to the Indo-Pacific after Biden took office in 2021, talk with Indo-Pacific countries this time will likely be more about how they can help Ukraine's war effort.\n\nWhat steps have NATO members taken in the Indo-Pacific?\n\nRecent years have seen some stepped-up European engagement in the Indo-Pacific, notably Britain's involvement with the U.S. in the AUKUS project to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.\n\nHowever, most European defense engagement in Asia has been ad hoc and modest, involving occasional patrols or exercises by small visiting forces.\n\nMany NATO allies and Indo-Pacific countries do not want to see the alliance expanding its remit beyond the North Atlantic theater.\n\nA proposal to establish a NATO liaison office in Tokyo, which angered China, was blocked by France last year.\n\nWhat is next for NATO involvement in the region?\n\nSome analysts contend that Europe's NATO members must boost their ability to deal with European security challenges to enable the U.S. to focus on Asia and threats posed by China, including the dispute over Taiwan, the democratic island Beijing claims as its territory.\n\nChristopher Johnstone, a former senior official in Biden's National Security Council, said the biggest contribution Europe could make was \"to ensure that it is prepared to shoulder the burden of deterrence against the Russian threat in the event of a Taiwan or other contingency in the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nNATO has touted efforts by members to meet defense spending goals of 2% of GDP, but analysts say that decades of low spending have left most countries unable to play any meaningful role the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"There's nothing (NATO countries) can really do that would make a material difference,\" in an Indo-Pacific conflict, said Elbridge Colby, a former Pentagon official in the Trump administration.\n\nColby said most European militaries would be reliant on the U.S. for basic logistics.\n\n\"It's entirely possible that their contribution would be a net negative,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "japantimes.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Japan Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_martina@japantimes.co.jp",

Ukraine", "body": "WASHINGTON -- NATO leaders attending a landmark summit have backed Ukraine's \"irreversible path\" to membership, saying that Kyiv has a right to choose its own security arrangements and that its \"future is in NATO.\"\n\nThe position, laid out in a joint statement following the first day of discussions at the summit on July 10, provided a clear sign of NATO's continued support for Ukraine's efforts to defend itself against invading Russian forces.\n\n\"We reaffirm that we will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met,\" the statement said.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the conclusion of the day's meetings, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg discussed a number of steps that were agreed upon to help Ukraine more than two years after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\nStoltenberg outlined the launching of a new project under which the alliance will coordinate military support and training for the first time, with a command center in Germany.\n\nHe also lauded improved defense funding by alliance members, with 23 of the alliance's 32 members meeting the target of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product this year, and their approval of a pledge to boost defense production.\n\nStoltenberg defended the provision of weapons to Ukraine, saying it was Ukraine's right under international law to defend itself and to strike military sites on Russian territory.\n\nThe goal, Stoltenberg said, was not to prolong the war, but to end it, and that \"unless we want to bow to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin we need to show commitment and resolve.\"\n\nThe summit, which will conclude on July 11, is set to discuss a proposal to provide Ukraine with 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military aid for next year, after member states couldn't agree on a multiyear military aid package for Ukraine that Stoltenberg had proposed.\n\nStoltenberg also said that other decisions were made in an effort to make \"NATO stronger, and allies safer,\" including the establishment of a new antiballistic missile base in Poland.\n\nStoltenberg also had sharp criticism for China, whose support for Russia in its war against Ukraine, he said, increased threats to European security.\n\nStoltenberg earlier said that should Russia be victorious in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it would embolden Iran, China, and North Korea and shape the global-security environment for decades to come.\n\nThe joint summit declaration singled out China as a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, in his welcoming remarks to the NATO leaders prior to their discussions, lauded the new pledge by NATO members to ramp up their defense production, while stressing that the alliance will not hesitate to defend its territory.\n\nBiden noted Russia's advancements in churning out munitions and weaponry for use in its war against Ukraine.\n\n\"We cannot allow the alliance to fall behind,\" Biden said, adding that Russia's war effort benefited from the help of China, North Korea, and Iran.\n\n\"This new pledge sends an unmistakable message to the world that every NATO member is committed to doing their part to keep the alliance strong,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We can and will defend every inch of NATO territory, and do it together.\"\n\nThe first day of meetings opened with the United States saying F-16 fighter jets were on their way to Kyiv while a draft communique being worked on noted Ukraine's \"irreversible path\" to NATO membership.\n\nAs NATO leaders began streaming into the main summit venue on July 10, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that \"as we speak, the transfer of F-16 jets is under way, coming from Denmark, coming from the Netherlands.\"\n\nA joint statement from the countries involved confirmed Blinken's comments, with the fighters expected to arrive during the summer.\n\n\"This is a clear signal that Russia's ability to terrorize Ukrainian people, cities, and communities will continue to reduce,\" said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who for months has been urging NATO leaders to speed up deliveries of all types of weaponry, especially jets and anti-missile systems as Russia intensifies its air campaign.\n\nPutin has made clear that Russian demands for a peace settlement include Ukraine's exclusion from NATO.\n\nIn addition to the announcement on F-16s, officials have been preparing further support for Kyiv that will be unveiled over the course of the summit.\n\nThe summit takes place against the backdrop of U.S. political uncertainty and Russia's intensification of its bombing of Ukraine.\n\nOfficials and analysts have noted recently that as Russia steps up its attacks, it appears to positioning itself for a long-term conflict.\n\nA senior NATO official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said that despite dwindling resources, Russia would likely be able to maintain its war economy for three to four years.\n\nHowever, the official added that the Kremlin lacked the munitions and troops to launch a major offensive against Ukraine in the near term.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose pro-Russian views have irked the alliance, is likely to test NATO's unity.\n\nOrban, who just took over the rotating presidency of the EU, flew to Moscow last week and then to China without informing the bloc ahead of time to discuss an end to the war with Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nBiden's performance at the summit will also be closely watched amid concerns about his age and ability to lead after a dismal showing in a debate with Republican rival Donald Trump as Americans prepare to vote in a presidential election on November 5.\n\nA growing number of fellow Democrats have called for Biden to end his reelection campaign since the debate on June 26.\n\nBiden's poor debate performance and the specter of another Trump presidency has many European allies worried.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors": [],

also looks to Asia - World News", "body": "NATO leaders on Thursday will hold talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and turn their attention to the challenge from China at a meeting with Asian partners, as they wrap up a three-day summit in Washington.\n\nThe 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled set piece in the U.S. capital to showcase its resolve against Russia and backing for Kiev.\n\nTheir gathering has been overshadowed by political uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden -- who will give a press conference Thursday -- fights for his own political survival.\n\nZelensky will join his NATO counterparts at a giant convention center in the heart of the U.S. capital after getting promises of new weaponry to bolster the defense of the skies over Ukraine.\n\nBut he has called on Kiev's backers, especially the United States, to go further -- including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.\n\n\"Imagine how much we can achieve when all limitations are lifted,\" Zelensky said on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nNATO's leaders on Wednesday once again demurred from issuing his war-torn country a clear invitation to join their alliance.\n\nZelensky unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at a summit in Lithuania last year by lambasting NATO's reluctance on membership.\n\nIn a bid to soften any disappointment this time around, NATO leaders called Ukraine's path to membership \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also pledged to provide Kiev a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military support \"within the next year.\"\n\nBiden announced that Denmark and the Netherlands had begun sending U.S.-made F-16 jets to Ukraine -- making good on a key promise last year to Kiev, which has struggled to gain parity in the air with Russia.\n\nHe earlier announced new air defense systems for Ukraine and said the United States had agreed to place long-range missiles periodically in Germany.\n\nUkraine has for years sought but failed to win membership in NATO, which as an alliance considers an attack on one an attack on all.\n\nBut Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have led concerns that bringing in Kiev now would effectively be entering war with nuclear-armed Russia as it occupies swathes of Ukrainian territory.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, visiting days after his Labour Party swept to power, promised Zelensky that Britain -- unlike the United States -- was united across partisan lines on supporting Ukraine.\n\nStarmer made clear he had no issue with Ukraine using UK missiles to strike into Russian territory, remarks that drew a rebuke from Moscow.\n\nThe summit, Starmer told reporters, is showing Putin that NATO is \"bigger now than it's ever been, more united than it's ever been, and absolutely clear-eyed about the threat of Russian aggression.\"\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Russia fired a barrage of missiles on Ukraine, killing dozens, including in Kiev where a children's hospital was reduced to debris.\n\nChina 'enabling' Russia\n\nAhead of the sit-down with Zelensky, NATO will switch its focus to the growing challenge from China as it welcomes the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nNATO leaders have expressed their \"profound concern\" about the deepening ties between Beijing and Moscow.\n\nA declaration from the summit released Wednesday called China a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its supplies of dual-use goods such as microchips that can help Moscow's military.\n\nChina \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the leaders said.\n\nBeijing has already angrily rejected the accusations from NATO and says the U.S.-led alliance is seeking an excuse to expand its influence eastwards.\n\nThe United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the threats posed by China.\n\nThe summit in Washington will be the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.\n\nSeveral initiatives including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation with the partner countries are expected to be announced.\n\nBut the Pacific leaders' presence is more about signaling NATO's greater interest in the region at a time of growing competition between Washington with Beijing.\n\nWorried by the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House after November elections, European allies see increasing their focus on China as a way of keeping the United States engaged.\n\n\"I think the message sent from NATO, from this summit, is very strong and very clear, and we are clearly defining China's responsibility when it comes to enabling Russia's war,\" NATO's outgoing secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hurriyet Daily News"}, "authors":

They are due to hold a session with NATO and EU leaders on Thursday amid rising concerns that China might attack Taiwan and worries about Russia's stepped-up security ties with China and nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration has worked to strengthen ties in the Indo-Pacific, including with India, and has been disappointed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow just ahead of the NATO meeting, which he will not attend.\n\nAustralian Prime Minster Anthony Albanese also will not be at the summit, given domestic political priorities.\n\nWhat is behind NATO's interest in the region?\n\nU.S. allies globally are increasingly aligned in their opposition to Russia's war in Ukraine, and Moscow's \"no limits\" partnership with China, which is helping to reconstitute the Russian military.\n\nIn 2022, NATO members identified China as a potential threat for the first time. At the 2023 NATO summit in Vilnius, they condemned China and Russia for \"their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order,\" and warned about Beijing's \"coercive tactics\" to divide the Alliance.\n\nA draft of the Washington summit statement called China a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's Ukraine war effort and said Beijing poses systemic challenges to Europe and to security.\n\nIt stressed the importance of the Indo-Pacific to NATO, saying developments there directly affect Euro-Atlantic security, and welcomed enhanced cooperation with Asia-Pacific partners to support Ukraine.\n\nU.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan said the NATO allies and Indo-Pacific partners would launch four new joint projects - on Ukraine, artificial intelligence, disinformation, and cybersecurity.\n\nBut while the Biden administration pushed for European allies to pay more attention to the Indo-Pacific after Biden took office in 2021, talk with Indo-Pacific countries this time will likely be more about how they can help Ukraine's war effort.\n\nWhat steps have NATO members taken in the Indo-Pacific?\n\nRecent years have seen some stepped up European engagement in the Indo-Pacific, notably Britain's involvement with the U.S. in the AUKUS project to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia.\n\nHowever, most European defense engagement in Asia has been ad hoc and modest, involving occasional patrols or exercises by small visiting forces. Many NATO allies and Indo-Pacific countries do not want to see the alliance expanding its remit beyond the North Atlantic theater.\n\nA proposal to establish a NATO liaison office in Tokyo, which angered China, was blocked by France last year.\n\nWhat is next for NATO involvement in the region?\n\nSome analysts contend that Europe's NATO members must boost their ability to deal with European security challenges to enable the U.S. to focus on Asia and threats posed by China, including the dispute over Taiwan, the democratic island Beijing claims as its territory.\n\nChristopher Johnstone, a former senior official in Biden's National Security Council, said the biggest contribution Europe could make was \"to ensure that it is prepared to shoulder the burden of deterrence against the Russian threat in the event of a Taiwan or other contingency in the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nNATO has touted efforts by members to meet defense spending goals of 2% of GDP, but analysts say that decades of low spending have left most countries unable to play any meaningful role the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"There's nothing (NATO countries) can really do that would make a material difference,\" in an

The allies are committed to supporting Ukraine's path to Euro-Atlantic integration, including potential NATO membership once conditions are met.\n\nThe document highlights the significance of the Indo-Pacific region to NATO, noting that developments there impact Euro-Atlantic security. The alliance seeks enhanced cooperation with Asia-Pacific partners to support Ukraine. Additionally, NATO raises concerns about China's space capabilities and activities, urging Beijing to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions.\n\nNATO allies also stress the importance of maintaining communication channels with Moscow to mitigate risks and prevent escalation.

He also urged cooperation to confront new security threats that transcend geographical boundaries, such as cyber-attacks and conflicts in space.\n\nSouth Korea, Australia and New Zealand, which along with Japan are known as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP4), are also attending the July 10-11 meeting with NATO leaders. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told Reuters this week that he planned to discuss the threat Pyongyang poses to Europe by deepening its Russia ties.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-Un signed a mutual defence pledge with Russia last month during President Valdimir Putin's first visit to Pyongyang in 24 years, and expressed his \"full support\" for Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have accused Pyongyang of providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells that Russia has used in its war in Ukraine and say they fear Moscow in return could provide support for North Korea's nuclear missile development.\n\nWashington has also said China is supplying drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools to Russia, items which fall short of lethal assistance but are helping Moscow build its military to sustain the Ukraine war. Beijing has said it has not provided any weaponry to any party.\n\nWithout naming China, Kishida told Reuters \"some countries\" have allegedly transferred dual-use civilian-military goods to Russia which has served \"as a lifeline\" for its Ukraine war.\n\n\"It is necessary to grapple with such situations in a multi-faceted and strategic manner, taking a panoramic view that considers the full range of international actors fuelling Russia\u00b4s attempt to change the status quo by force,\" he said.\n\n\"The geographical boundary of 'Euro-Atlantic' or 'Indo-Pacific' is no longer relevant in safeguarding global peace and security. Japan and Indo-Pacific partners can play a great role for NATO allies from this perspective.\"\n\nConstrained by decades of pacifism, Tokyo has been reluctant to supply lethal aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt has, however, provided financial aid to Kyiv, spearheaded efforts to prepare for its post-war reconstruction, and contributed to NATO\u00b4s fund to provide Ukraine with non-lethal equipment such as anti-drone detection systems.\n\nTokyo has also repeatedly warned about the risks of a similar conflict emerging in East Asia, where China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance towards its territorial claims including the democratic island of Taiwan.\n\n\"This summit is a critical opportunity for Japan, the U.S., and the other NATO allies to confront the ongoing challenges against the international order and to reaffirm values and principles that have shaped global peace and prosperity,\" he said. There may be limits, however, over how far NATO members are prepared to go in forging closer ties in Asia. A plan that surfaced last year for NATO to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, was blocked by France and criticised by China.

China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard,\" they added.\n\nChina has refused to condemn Russia's invasion and last year released a paper calling for a \"political settlement\" to the conflict, which Western countries said could enable Russia to retain much of the territory it has seized in Ukraine.\n\nChina and Russia's strategic partnership has grown closer since the invasion.\n\nBeijing presents itself as a neutral party in the war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nIt has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nBut that economic partnership has come under close scrutiny from the West in recent months, with Washington vowing to go after financial institutions that facilitate Moscow's war effort.\n\nThe United States and Europe have also accused Beijing of selling components and equipment necessary to keep Moscow's military production afloat.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in April this included \"machine tools, semiconductors, other dual-use items that have helped Russia rebuild the defence industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade\".\n\nBeijing has denied claims it is aiding Russia's fighting in Ukraine and insisted it won't accept \"criticism or pressure\" over its ties with Moscow.\n\nAnd on Thursday, its foreign ministry accused the alliance of \"prejudice, smearing and provocation\".\n\n\"NATO's rhetoric about China's responsibility in Ukraine is unjustified and malicious,\" spokesman Lin Jian said.\n\n\"We urge NATO to reflect on the root causes of the crisis and its own actions, listen carefully to the just voice of the international community, and take concrete actions to ease the situation, instead of shifting the blame to others.\"", "source": {"uri": "manilastandard.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

That includes the U.S., the Netherlands and Denmark announcing that the first NATO-provided F-16s would be in the hands of Ukrainian military pilots by this summer.The 32-members of NATO on Wednesday formally declared Ukraine on an \"irreversible\" path to membership in the Western military alliance, offering a bare but more binding assurance of protection once its war with Russia ends.\n\nNATO member countries individually and in Wednesday's joint statement from their summit in Washington announced a series of steps aimed at bolstering Ukraine's defenses. That includes the U.S., the Netherlands and Denmark announcing that the first NATO-provided F-16s would be in the hands of Ukrainian military pilots by this summer.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted his appreciation of the effort to strengthen his air force, coming soon after Ukraine saw one of the deadliest strikes of the war.\n\nNATO on Wednesday also announced a long-term commitment of security assistance to Ukraine, and confirmed establishment of a new NATO center aimed at ensuring that Ukraine gets a more reliable flow of arms and training from members of the alliance. But the commitments still fall short of the striking power Ukraine says it needs to defeat the invading Russian forces.\n\nThe final statement called China - which the West says provides components for Russia's weapons - a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine's future is in NATO,\" alliance members said in their statement. \"We will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.\"\n\nThe alliance welcomed Ukraine's democratic, economic and security reforms needed to join and said it would get an invitation \"when Allies agree and conditions are met.\"\n\nWhile the leaders stand ready to offer Ukraine the means to defend itself in a war now in its third year, nowhere do they say that Ukraine should prevail over Russia. Indeed, their statement said that \"NATO does not seek confrontation, and poses no threat to Russia. We remain willing to maintain channels of communication with Moscow to mitigate risk and prevent escalation.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg underlined that Ukraine will not join the alliance's ranks immediately. But he insisted that must happen after the war is over to ensure that Russia never attacks Ukraine again.\n\nOf the overall NATO assistance, he said, \"We are not doing this because we want to prolong a war. We are doing it because we want to end a war as soon as possible.\n\nStoltenberg also delivered a passionate defense of the military alliance itself Wednesday when reporters asked about the possibility that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, a NATO critic, could pull U.S. support for the alliance if he wins in November.\n\nTrump has been an unofficial but primary topic at the summit, especially among East European governments that believe their country could be targets of future Russian aggression.\n\nThe criticism of the alliance from the United States, Stoltenberg said, without naming Trump, has \"not been about NATO. It's about NATO allies not investing enough in NATO. And that has changed.\"\n\nAs NATO leaders met in Washington, Trump on the campaign trail Tuesday renewed his threat not to defend any NATO members from a Russian attack if their military spending does not meet NATO's target of at least 2% of their gross domestic product. But since 2021, the number of allies meeting this target has increased from six to 23.\n\n\"The United States has been understood,\" Stoltenberg said. \"Allies have acted.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, was asked several times on Fox News Radio whether he wants the U.S. to exit NATO. He answered, \"No, I want them to pay their bills.\"\n\nThe U.S. and some other countries have opposed membership for Ukraine during the conflict with Russia to avoid an escalation of tensions that could lead to a larger war. They also have stressed that Ukraine must take significant steps to address corruption as well as other systemic reforms.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has long bitterly opposed neighboring Ukraine's fight to join the Western alliance, declaring it an encroachment on Russia's security and interests.\n\n\"I think it's very important to give a message to the Kremlin from here - that Ukraine's path and bridge towards NATO membership is now irreversible,\" Finnish President Alexander Stubb told reporters.\n\nPresident Joe Biden reaffirmed U.S. support for Ukraine but also more broadly the importance of NATO. He noted that since he took office not only has military spending increased but the number of battle groups has doubled on NATO's eastern flank.\n\n\"We can and will defend every inch of NATO territory, and we will do it together,\" Biden said.\n\nZelenskyy, in Washington for the NATO summit, had stressed what he called Ukraine's urgent need for the F-16 fighter jets in a speech to friendly Republican lawmakers Tuesday night. He said his country needed more than 100 to start to counter devastating Russian air attacks on Ukraine's cities, energy infrastructure and other vital targets. He said Russia was using 300 jets to carry out the attacks.\n\nSix nations, including the United States, are training Ukrainians on the F-16s, but officials have not released precise numbers or all the locations.\n\nChief of Staff of the Air Force, Gen. David Allvin, just returned from Morris Air National Guard Base in Tucson, Arizona, where the U.S. training is taking place. Of the initial class of 12 Ukrainian pilots, seven completed training in May and the remaining five are expected to do so in August, Allvin said.\n\nThe pilots have learned to fly the fighter jet and will get follow-on training once they leave the U.S., but the value of getting Ukraine's F-16 program running is more about the longer-term, he said. \"I don't know that it's realistic to assume that it's going to be a game-changer on the battlefield right now,\" Allvin said.\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, met behind closed doors with senators for nearly an hour Wednesday and requested more defense help, said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. Zelenskyy also met with the Republican speaker of the House.\n\nSeparately Wednesday, the U.S. and Germany announced they would begin \"episodic deployments\" of long-range missiles to Germany in 2026, including Tomahawk, SM-6 and hypersonic missiles.\n\nThe announcement is notable because land-based firing of some of those missiles from within Europe would have been banned under the former Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. They were banned because the conventional missiles could have been modified to be nuclear capable and their use on the European continent would have meant that potential targets would have had no time to react.\n\nKimball said while the deployment is likely being done to reassure allies, Russia may respond by deploying conventional or nuclear weapons of its own.\n\nEuropean and U.S. allies have announced other new arms deliveries, such as dozens of air defense systems, including Patriots, this week.\n\nThe promises of new weapons come after opposition from Republican lawmakers allied to Trump blocked a U.S. support package to Ukraine for months earlier this year, allowing Russia to make battlefield gains against Ukrainian forces who were fighting with dwindling arms and ammunition.\n\nEuropeans and NATO, as a lesson from that setback, have vowed to take on more of the responsibility for ensuring a reliable flow of military support to Ukraine.", "source": {"uri":

Its trade with Russia has grown since the invasion, at least partially offsetting the impact of Western sanctions.\n\nWATCH l Retired major, a former NATO official, on the alliance's uncertain future with U.S.:\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jin said at a regular press briefing Thursday that the county's trade with Russia is legitimate.\n\n\"On the Ukraine crisis, NATO hyped up China's responsibility. It makes no sense and comes with malicious intent,\" said Lin. \"We urge NATO to reflect on the root cause of the crisis and what it has done, and take concrete action to de-escalate rather than shift blame.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping attended a meeting of leaders or top officials from the 10 Shanghai Co-operation Organization countries in Kazakhstan.\n\nThis week, Chinese troops are in Belarus for joint drills near the border with Poland, a NATO member. The exercises are the first with Belarus, an ally of Russia, with which it shares a single-party system under President Alexander Lukashenko, whose regime cracked down brutally on mass protests against his rule in 2020. Lin described the joint training as a normal military operation that is not directed at any particular country.\n\nBeijing put forward a 12-point paper more than a year ago that set out general principles for ending the war, but did not get into specifics. It received a lukewarm reception at the time in both Russia and Ukraine.\n\nChinese officials on Thursday also repeated charges that NATO has expanded its presence to the Asia-Pacific Region, saying it disrupts the prosperity and stability of the region.\n\nLeaders of Japan, South Korea, New Zealand and Australia are in attendance at the NATO summit in the U.S., having forged stronger ties with the security alliance amid rising concerns over China's aggressions in the South China Sea.\n\nNATO member Hungary hasn't specifically commented on the draft statement, but Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told Hungary's state television on Thursday it does not want, and will not support, NATO becoming an \"anti-China\" bloc.\n\nEarlier this week, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban paid an unexpected visit to Beijing, meeting with Xi to discuss a potential Ukraine peace deal.\n\nHungary has become an important trade and investment partner for China, in contrast with many other European nations, who are seeking to become less dependent on Beijing.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

as NATO summit also looks to Asia", "body": "Washington (AFP) - NATO leaders on Thursday will hold talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and turn their attention to the challenge from China at a meeting with Asian partners, as they wrap up a three-day summit in Washington.\n\nThe 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled set piece in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Russia and backing for Kyiv.\n\nTheir gathering has been overshadowed by political uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden -- who will give a press conference Thursday -- fights for his own political survival.\n\nZelensky will join his NATO counterparts at a giant convention center in the heart of the US capital after getting promises of new weaponry to bolster the defense of the skies over Ukraine.\n\nBut he has called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further -- including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.\n\n\"Imagine how much we can achieve when all limitations are lifted,\" Zelensky said on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nNATO's leaders on Wednesday once again demurred from issuing his war-torn country a clear invitation to join their alliance.\n\nZelensky unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at a summit in Lithuania last year by lambasting NATO's reluctance on membership.\n\nIn a bid to soften any disappointment this time around, NATO leaders called Ukraine's path to membership \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military support \"within the next year.\"\n\nChina 'enabling' Russia\n\nAhead of the sit-down with Zelensky, NATO will switch its focus to the growing challenge from China as it welcomes the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nNATO leaders have expressed their \"profound concern\" about the deepening ties between Beijing and Moscow.\n\nA declaration from the summit released Wednesday called China a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its supplies of dual-use goods such as microchips that can help Moscow's military.\n\nChina \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the leaders said.\n\nBeijing has already angrily rejected the accusations from NATO and says the US-led alliance is seeking an excuse to expand its influence eastwards.\n\nThe United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the threats posed by China.\n\nThe summit in Washington will be the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.\n\nSeveral initiatives including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation with the partner countries are expected to be announced.\n\nBut the Pacific leaders' presence is more about signaling NATO's greater interest in the region at a time of growing competition between Washington with Beijing.\n\nWorried by the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House after November elections, European allies see increasing their focus on China as a way of keeping the United States engaged.\n\n\"I think the message sent from NATO, from this summit, is very strong and very clear, and we are clearly defining China's responsibility when it comes to enabling Russia's war,\" NATO's outgoing secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Charter\" and end its \"material and political support to Russia's war effort.\"\n\nBeijing has denied it is arming either side of the conflict and maintains it is a neutral party as it calls for a negotiated peace settlement.\n\nChina, which declared a \"no limits\" partnership with Russia shortly before Moscow launched its war in 2022, has refused to condemn Russia for its invasion or label it as such. Government censors vigilantly scrub anti-war criticism of Moscow from Chinese social media.\n\n\"The PRC (People's Republic of China) cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the statement said, using China's official name.\n\nNATO and the Russian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to written requests for comment.\n\nThe NATO leaders expressed concern over China's rapid expansion and modernization of its nuclear weapons stockpile, activities in outer space, and \"malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation.\"\n\nThe leaders of Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand are attending the summit as observers for the third straight year, while Australia has sent its deputy prime minister.\n\nNATO's increasing engagement with its four Asia-Pacific partners has riled China, which has criticized the alliance as a Cold War relic expanding beyond its mandate as a regional alliance.\n\nChina opposes NATO \"inserting itself into the Asia-Pacific to incite confrontation and rivalry, and disrupting the prosperity and stability in this region,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said during Wednesday's regular press conference. He called on the transatlantic alliance to make a \"real contribution\" to global peace and security.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Republican candidate Donald Trump, 78, has questioned the amount of aid given to Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion and U.S. support for allies generally.\n\nTRUMP WEIGHS IN\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump told Fox News Radio he would not pull the U.S. out of NATO but reiterated that he wanted members to pay more. \"I just want them to pay their bills. We're protecting Europe. They take advantage of us very badly,\" he said.\n\nTrump had pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine before later reversing course.\n\nUncertainty about U.S. leadership has unsettled NATO allies.\n\n\"If there's one thing that I'm concerned about with the United States, it's the polarization of the political climate - it is, I have to admit, very toxic,\" Finland's Stubb told reporters.\n\nWhile Biden has been seeking to rally allies and domestic support, several high-ranking European officials met a top foreign policy adviser to Trump during the summit.\n\nThe communique says the alliance will continue to support Ukraine \"on its irreversible path to full Euro-atlantic integration, including NATO membership\".

threatened the block, you stepped up': Ukraine gets NATO F-16 jets | News24", "body": "The NATO promised that Ukraine was on the path to NATO membership.\n\nNATO allies on Wednesday announced they had started transferring F-16 jets to Ukraine while stepping up promises to Kyiv on eventual membership in the alliance, at a 75th anniversary summit clouded by political uncertainties in the United States.\n\nWith the pomp of the three-day gathering in the US capital, US President Joe Biden is aiming to rally the West and also reassure voters amid pre-election scrutiny of whether at 81 - six years older than NATO itself - he remains fit for the job.\n\nBiden individually welcomed the other 31 leaders of the alliance before urging them to keep pace with Russia's military production, which has stepped up sharply in the two years since President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.\n\n\"We can - and will - defend every inch of NATO territory and we'll do it together,\" Biden told the North Atlantic Council, the formal decision-making body of the alliance, at Washington's convention centre as the city sweltered under a heat wave.\n\nBiden announced that Denmark and the Netherlands had begun sending US-made F-16 jets to Ukraine - making good on a key promise last year to Kyiv, which has struggled to gain parity in the air with Russia.\n\nREAD | 'Shelling targeted civilians': Outrage at Russian attack on Ukraine children's hospital, 37 dead\n\nHe earlier announced new air defence systems for Ukraine and said the US had agreed to place long-range missiles periodically in Germany.\n\nIn the evening, Biden hosted the NATO leaders for a gala dinner, marked by storm clouds that forced the cancellation of a planned flypast.\n\nBiden compared the alliance to his childhood neighbourhood, saying:\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the F-16 transfer \"concentrates Vladimir Putin's mind on the fact that he will not outlast Ukraine, he will not outlast us\".\n\nBut White House challenger Donald Trump, who is edging out Biden in polls leading up to November's presidential election, has mused about bringing a quick peace settlement by pushing Ukraine to surrender territory to Russia.\n\nThe Republican mogul has repeatedly questioned the utility of NATO - formed in 1949 as collective defence against Moscow - which he sees as an unfair burden on the US.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Russia fired a barrage of missiles on Ukraine, killing dozens, including in Kyiv where a children's hospital was reduced to debris.\n\nBiden invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the summit, who voiced gratitude for the F-16s.\n\nThe new aircraft will \"bring just and lasting peace closer, demonstrating that terror must fail\", Zelensky wrote on social media.\n\nThe summit aimed in part to \"Trump-proof\" the alliance including by giving NATO a greater role, rather than the US, in coordinating arms delivery into Ukraine.\n\nIn a joint declaration, NATO leaders promised to give Ukraine \u20ac40 billion ($43 billion) in military aid \"within the next year\" - part of efforts to increase stability after Trump's allies in Congress held up US assistance for months.\n\nTrump's aides have also discussed conditioning aid to Ukraine on forcing Kyiv to the negotiating table and said that China, not Russia, is a larger concern to US interests.\n\nThe NATO leaders' statement took aim at China as well, voicing \"profound concern\" over its industrial support to Russia.\n\nChina's reaction was swift.\n\n\"NATO should stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry, and do more to contribute to world peace and stability,\" a spokesperson for Beijing's mission to the EU said, adding that \"China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard.\"\n\nBiden invited four key Pacific partners to the summit - Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - as he seeks to increase NATO's role in Asia.\n\nThe summit also stepped up promises to Ukraine, saying that it was on an \"irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership\".\n\nUkraine has for years sought but failed to win membership in NATO, which as an alliance considers an attack on one an attack on all.\n\nBut Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have led concerns that bringing in Kyiv now would effectively be entering war with nuclear-armed Russia as it occupies swathes of Ukrainian territory.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, visiting days after his Labour Party swept to power, promised Zelensky that Britain - unlike the US - was united across partisan lines on supporting Ukraine.\n\nStarmer made clear he had no issue with Ukraine using UK missiles to strike into Russian territory, remarks that drew a rebuke from Moscow.\n\nThe summit, Starmer told reporters, is showing Putin that NATO is \"bigger now than it's ever been, more united than it's ever been, and absolutely clear-eyed about the threat of Russian aggression\".", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv",

When the bullies threatened the block, you stepped up.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the F-16 transfer \"concentrates Vladimir Putin's mind on the fact that he will not outlast

settlement by pushing Ukraine to surrender territory to Russia.\n\nThe Republican mogul has repeatedly questioned the utility of NATO - formed in 1949 as collective defense against Moscow - which he sees as an unfair burden on the United States.\n\nOn the eve of the summit, Russia fired a barrage of missiles on Ukraine, killing dozens, including in Kyiv where a children's hospital was reduced to debris.\n\nBiden invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the summit, who voiced gratitude for the F-16s.\n\nThe new aircraft will \"bring just and lasting peace closer, demonstrating that terror must fail,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media.\n\nThe summit aimed in part to \"Trump-proof\" the alliance including by giving NATO a greater role, rather than the United States, in coordinating arms delivery into Ukraine.\n\nIn a joint declaration, NATO leaders promised to give Ukraine 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military aid \"within the next year\" - part of efforts to increase stability after Trump's allies in Congress held up U.S. assistance for months.\n\nTrump's aides have also discussed conditioning aid to Ukraine on forcing Kyiv to the negotiating table and said that China, not Russia, is a larger concern to U.S. interests.\n\nThe NATO leaders' statement took aim at China as well, voicing \"profound concern\" over its industrial support to Russia.\n\nChina's reaction was swift.\n\n\"NATO should stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry and do more to contribute to world peace and stability,\" a spokesman for Beijing's mission to the EU said, adding that \"China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard.\"\n\nBiden invited four key Pacific partners to the summit - Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - as he seeks to increase NATO's role in Asia.\n\nThe summit also stepped up promises to Ukraine, saying that it was on an \"irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.\"\n\nUkraine has for years sought but failed to win membership in NATO, which as an alliance considers an attack on one an attack on all.\n\nBut Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have led concerns that bringing in Kyiv now would effectively be entering a war with nuclear-armed Russia as it occupies swathes of Ukrainian territory.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, visiting days after his Labour Party swept to power, promised Zelensky that Britain - unlike the United States - was united across partisan lines on supporting Ukraine.\n\nStarmer made clear he had no issue with Ukraine using U.K. missiles to strike into Russian territory, remarks that drew a rebuke from Moscow.\n\nThe summit, Starmer told reporters, is showing Putin that NATO is \"bigger now than it's ever been, more united than it's ever been and absolutely clear-eyed about the threat of Russian aggression.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"},

Blinken announced at a recent summit that the jets will be operational \"this summer.\"\n\nIn addition to the aircraft transfer, NATO members have agreed to establish a new unit to coordinate military aid and training for the Ukrainian army. This initiative is part of broader measures to deepen ties between the alliance and Ukraine. A joint statement from the NATO summit emphasized that these measures, combined with aid commitments from individual members, \"constitute a bridge to Ukraine's membership in NATO.\"\n\nThe statement noted that Ukraine has made \"concrete progress\" on \"required democratic, economic, and security reforms\" in recent months. However, a formal invitation for NATO membership will only be extended once \"conditions are met.\" The statement added, \"As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.\"\n\nThe ongoing invasion of Ukraine was a top agenda item at NATO's summit. A declaration agreed upon by all members identified Russia as \"the most significant and direct threat\" to security. It also accused China of being a \"decisive enabler\" for Russia's war against Ukraine, prompting an angry response from Beijing's mission to the EU, which called on NATO to \"stop hyping up the so-called China threat, and provoking confrontation and rivalry.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attended the NATO summit, meeting with various world leaders, including his first meeting with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. Sir Keir assured Zelensky there would be \"no change in support\" for Ukraine's war effort despite the new government in London. Zelensky also met with US politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties to bolster cross-party support for Ukraine, following a stand-off in Congress earlier this year that delayed a large military aid package.\n\n\"We reaffirm that we will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met. The Summit decisions by NATO and the NATO-Ukraine Council, combined with Allies' ongoing work, constitute a bridge to Ukraine's membership in NATO,\" the declaration stated.\n\nPresident Joe Biden opened the NATO meeting with brief public remarks, emphasizing the urgency of maintaining defence production parity with Russia. \"Right now, Russia is on a wartime footing with regard to defence production,\" Biden said. \"... We cannot, in my view, allow the alliance to fall behind.\" Biden also delivered remarks at NATO's 75th-anniversary event, declaring the alliance \"more powerful than ever.\"\n\nDespite these commitments, there may be some disappointment in Kyiv due to the lack of a clear timeline for Ukraine's full membership in NATO. The summit, marking the alliance's 75-year anniversary, comes months ahead of an election that could see NATO critic Donald Trump return to the White House, amidst ongoing political challenges for US President Joe Biden.", "source": {"uri": "greaterkashmir.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greater Kashmir"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org",

Asia", "body": "NATO leaders on Thursday will hold talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and turn their attention to the challenge from China at a meeting with Asian partners, as they wrap up a three-day summit in Washington.\n\nThe 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled set piece in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Russia and backing for Kyiv.\n\nTheir gathering has been overshadowed by political uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden -- who will give a press conference Thursday -- fights for his own political survival.\n\nZelensky will join his NATO counterparts at a giant convention center in the heart of the US capital after getting promises of new weaponry to bolster the defense of the skies over Ukraine.\n\nBut he has called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further -- including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.\n\n\"Imagine how much we can achieve when all limitations are lifted,\" Zelensky said on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nNATO's leaders on Wednesday once again demurred from issuing his war-torn country a clear invitation to join their alliance.\n\nZelensky unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at a summit in Lithuania last year by lambasting NATO's reluctance on membership.\n\nIn a bid to soften any disappointment this time around, NATO leaders called Ukraine's path to membership \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military support \"within the next year.\"\n\nAhead of the sit-down with Zelensky, NATO will switch its focus to the growing challenge from China as it welcomes the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nNATO leaders have expressed their \"profound concern\" about the deepening ties between Beijing and Moscow.\n\nA declaration from the summit released Wednesday called China a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its supplies of dual-use goods such as microchips that can help Moscow's military.\n\nChina \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the leaders said.\n\nBeijing has already angrily rejected the accusations from NATO and says the US-led alliance is seeking an excuse to expand its influence eastwards.\n\nThe United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the threats posed by China.\n\nThe summit in Washington will be the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.\n\nSeveral initiatives including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation with the partner countries are expected to be announced.\n\nBut the Pacific leaders' presence is more about signaling NATO's greater interest in the region at a time of growing competition between Washington with Beijing.\n\nWorried by the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House after November elections, European allies see increasing their focus on China as a way of keeping the United States engaged.\n\n\"I think the message sent from NATO, from this summit, is very strong and very clear, and we are clearly defining China's responsibility when it comes to enabling Russia's war,\" NATO's outgoing secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_delany@ibtimes.com", "name": "Max Delany", "type":

It has been reported that French President Emmanuel Macron expressed objections to what would be NATO's first outpost in Asia, a plan that China has also opposed.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nNATO leaders

That includes the US, the Netherlands and Denmark announcing that the first NATO-provided F-16s would be in the hands of Ukrainian military pilots by this summer.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted his appreciation of the effort to strengthen his air force, coming soon after Ukraine saw one of the deadliest strikes of the war.\n\nNATO on Wednesday also announced a long-term commitment of security assistance to Ukraine, and confirmed establishment of a new NATO center aimed at ensuring that Ukraine gets a more reliable flow of arms and training from members of the alliance. But the commitments still fall short of the striking power Ukraine says it needs to defeat the invading Russian forces.\n\nThe final statement called China - which the West says provides components for Russia's weapons - a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\n\"Ukraine's future is in NATO,\" alliance members said in their statement. \"We will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.\"\n\nThe alliance welcomed Ukraine's democratic, economic and security reforms needed to join and said it would get an invitation \"when Allies agree and conditions are met.\"\n\nWhile the leaders stand ready to offer Ukraine the means to defend itself in a war now in its third year, nowhere do they say that Ukraine should prevail over Russia. Indeed, their statement said that \"NATO does not seek confrontation, and poses no threat to Russia.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nThe declaration, the first of its kind, said China had been a major supplier of weapon components and defense equipment to Russia since the start of the war.\n\nIt included an implicit threat. \"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the declaration said.\n\nNatalie Sabanadze, a senior research fellow at Chatham House in London, told The New York Times she expected European countries to \"start sanctioning Chinese companies slowly, while carefully weighing consequences and a potential backlash.\"\n\nShe added that NATO's warning \"tells China that there will be costs.\"\n\nJens Stoltenberg, NATO's secretary-general, described the language as the \"strongest message NATO allies have ever sent on China's contributions to Russia's illegal war against Ukraine.\"\n\nNATO and the US believe China has supplied Russia with equipment such as chips and integrated circuits, which can be used to produce weapons. In response, China has said it is not a party to the Ukraine war and that there should be no interference with trade between China and Russia.\n\nChina hit back at the latest accusations, describing them as \"prejudice, smears and provocation.\" It added that NATO had a \"Cold War mentality\" and \"belligerent rhetoric.\"\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jin said \"NATO hyped up China's responsibility\" in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It makes no sense and comes with malicious intent,\" Lin said.\n\n\"We urge NATO to reflect on the root cause of the crisis and what it has done, and take concrete action to de-escalate rather than shift blame.\"\n\nThe declaration marks a key shift in NATO's stance on China. As The New York Times reported, the alliance used bland language when discussing issues or concerns surrounding China in the past. It first named the country as a concern in 2019.\n\nEuropean countries have historically been hesitant to stand against Beijing, known for its distribution of luxury items and cars, The Times reported.\n\nBut the language surrounding China has subtly evolved.\n\nLast week, NATO member and Finland's President Alexander Stubb said in an interview with Bloomberg that China has so much influence on Russia that it could effectively end the war.\n\n\"I argue that Russia is so dependent on China right now that one phone call from President Xi Jinping would solve this crisis,\" Stubb said.\"If he were to say, 'Time to start negotiating peace.'

Scholz have led concerns that bringing in Kyiv now would effectively be entering war with nuclear-armed Russia as it occupies swathes of Ukrainian territory.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, visiting days after his Labour Party swept to power, promised Zelensky that Britain -- unlike the United States -- was united across partisan lines on supporting Ukraine.\n\nStarmer made clear he had no issue with Ukraine using U.K. missiles to strike into Russian territory, remarks that drew a rebuke from Moscow.\n\nThe summit, Starmer told reporters, is showing Putin that NATO is \"bigger now than it's ever been, more united than it's ever been, and absolutely clear-eyed about the threat of Russian aggression.\"", "source": {"uri": "themoscowtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Biden and most European leaders also remained silent on Gaza.\n\nBut some leaders did speak up.\n\nYosuf Alabarda, analyst and retired Turkish colonel, said Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reminded Western leaders in his speech on Tuesday that NATO values were being trampled upon in Gaza, values that NATO leaders said were being violated by Russia and China.\n\n\"Erdogan clearly said in his speech: What happened to your Western values in Gaza?\" Alabarda told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"In the eyes of the whole world, there is a massacre going on in Gaza,\" he said, adding that NATO has largely ignored this, instead choosing to focus on Ukraine.\n\nSpain, too, had piercing words for its counterparts in the alliance, and called on the bloc to show the same \"unity and consistency\" for Gaza as they have demonstrated for Ukraine.\n\n\"We cannot be accused of applying double standards that would weaken our support for Ukraine. On the contrary, we demand the same unity and consistency for Gaza as we do in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told fellow NATO heads of state at an Atlantic Council session, according to Spanish press reports based on sources from the prime minister's office.\n\n\"If we're telling our people that we support Ukraine because we defend international law, we must do the same for Gaza. If we demand respect for international law in Ukraine, we must demand it in Gaza, as well,\" Sanchez pressed.\n\nAl Jazeera's Mike Hanna, reporting from the summit on Wednesday, said the lack of discussion about Gaza has been \"conspicuous\", particularly with the US's announcement that day that it was resuming shipments of 500-pound (227kg) bombs to Israel.\n\nThe 32-country bloc does not appear to have veered too far from its earlier policies during this year's summit, throwing continued full support behind Ukraine and portraying Russia, China, Iran and North Korea as the biggest threats to global security.\n\nBut some shifts were apparent.\n\nChina: The alliance stepped up its rhetoric against China, accusing it of being a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its \"large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base\". The bloc also levelled accusations at Iran and North Korea of fuelling the war by providing direct military support to Russia.\n\nGeorgia: Relations between the country and the West have deteriorated in the last couple of years, with NATO warning in May that Tbilisi's controversial new foreign agents law was a step away from Georgia's ambitions to integrate with Europe and join NATO. Since 2008, Georgia has been among a small set of countries that NATO has said will someday join the alliance -- if they meet a series of requirements.\n\nAt the NATO summit this week, however, the declaration that leaders agreed to was silent on Georgia's path towards membership in the alliance, even as it mentioned Ukraine, Moldova and Bosnia and Herzegovina -- the other aspirants for membership.\n\nThe summit has been the first opportunity for newly elected UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss his government's foreign policy as well as bilateral relations with allied leaders.\n\nOn Ukraine, Starmer has pledged that his Labour Party government will continue the previous Conservative administration's support to Kyiv.\n\nAccording to Steven Seegel, a professor at the Center for Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies at the University of Texas in Austin, a Labour government may deepen these ties with Ukraine on the three fronts of military, finances, and humanitarian diplomacy.\n\n\"Starmer has had a positive effect with his high-profile visits to Ukraine ... He met personally with [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy on several occasions. I recall his trips to Irpin and Bucha in February 2023, to see Russian war crimes up front; these were the most significant,\" Seegel told Al Jazeera.\n\nBiden's political struggles, however, loom large on the bloc's future.\n\nSerious questions about Biden's age and fitness for office have been raised domestically in recent days, following a debate performance against Republican contender and former President Donald Trump in which the incumbent president appeared lost and unable to communicate effectively.\n\nTrump is leading Biden in polls in key swing states ahead of the November election. He has threatened to pull the US, a founding NATO member and its biggest funder, from the alliance and is staunchly against providing more aid to Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com",

It will provide a fresh chance for him to prove to the American public that he's capable of serving another four years after his shocking debate flop threw the future of his presidency into doubt.\n\nThe flurry of final events at the NATO summit come a day after NATO labeled China a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war against Ukraine. China in turn accused NATO of seeking security at the expense of others and it has warned the military alliance not to bring the same \"chaos\" to Asia.\n\n\"We appreciate the close partnership with your country, and not least because our security is not regional, it is global,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said as he welcomed South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol for the last day of the alliance's summit in Washington.\n\n\"This is clearly illustrated by the war in Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg added.\n\nBiden shook hands with leaders as he walked into a Thursday morning meeting and smiled before taking a seat next to Stoltenberg.\n\nStoltenberg convened NATO leaders in the military alliance's main decision-making body, saying they would tackle \"shared security challenges, including Russia's war against Ukraine, China's support for Russia's war economy and the growing alignment of authoritarian powers.\"\n\nHe said allies must work ever closer to preserve peace.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Tractor Supply store, 269 homes approved on Aiken's Northside The Willcox among 100 best hotels in the world, according to Travel + Leisure rankings Aiken County school board determines projects to be funded by next round of Penny Sales Tax Aiken City Council recognizes four-time state champion Eliza King A common summer toy now banned from Aiken parks.

(North) Korea is one of the most important suppliers of raw material to Russia,\" he told reporters. He noted that maritime border tensions \"in the Indo-Pacific puts a threat to the stability of the whole region.\"\n\nAustralia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea are notably taking part in the summit.\n\nZelenskky will join allied leaders later for a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council, a forum set up a year ago for the 32 allies and Kyiv to meet on an equal footing to share concerns and information.\n\nOn Wednesday, NATO leaders promised Ukraine that it is on an \"irreversible path\" to membership, although it can only join sometime after the war, when the allies agree that it has met all the conditions.\n\nA missile attack on Ukraine's biggest children's hospital on the eve of the summit in Washington, to mark NATO's 75th anniversary, underscored that Russian President Vladimir Putin may not be ready to make peace for some time.\n\nMany allies also offered more military support, and NATO launched a new program to underwrite deliveries of military equipment and coordinate training for Ukraine's beleaguered armed forces. NATO members also committed to keep up current levels of military aid -- about 40 billion euros ($43.5 billion) annually -- for at least a year.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType":

He also urged cooperation to confront new security threats that transcend geographical boundaries, such as cyber-attacks and conflicts in space.\n\nSouth Korea, Australia and New Zealand, which along with Japan are known as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP4), are also attending the July 10-11 meeting with NATO leaders.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol told Reuters this week that he planned to discuss the threat Pyongyang poses to Europe by deepening its Russia ties.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-Un signed a mutual defence pledge with Russia last month during President Valdimir Putin's first visit to Pyongyang in 24 years, and expressed his \"full support\" for Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have accused Pyongyang of providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells that Russia has used in its war in Ukraine and say they fear Moscow in return could provide support for North Korea's nuclear missile development.\n\nWashington has also said China is supplying drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools to Russia, items which fall short of lethal assistance but are helping Moscow build its military to sustain the Ukraine war. Beijing has said it has not provided any weaponry to any party.\n\nWithout naming China, Kishida told Reuters \"some countries\" have allegedly transferred dual-use civilian-military goods to Russia which has served \"as a lifeline\" for its Ukraine war.\n\n\"It is necessary to grapple with such situations in a multi-faceted and strategic manner, taking a panoramic view that considers the full range of international actors fuelling Russia's attempt to change the status quo by force,\" he said.\n\n\"The geographical boundary of 'Euro-Atlantic' or 'Indo-Pacific' is no longer relevant in safeguarding global peace and security. Japan and Indo-Pacific partners can play a great role for NATO allies from this perspective.\"\n\nConstrained by decades of pacifism, Tokyo has been reluctant to supply lethal aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt has, however, provided financial aid to Kyiv, spearheaded efforts to prepare for its post-war reconstruction, and contributed to NATO's fund to provide Ukraine with non-lethal equipment such as anti-drone detection systems.\n\nTokyo has also repeatedly warned about the risks of a similar conflict emerging in East Asia, where China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance towards its territorial claims including the democratic island of Taiwan.\n\n\"This summit is a critical opportunity for Japan, the U.S., and the other NATO allies to confront the ongoing challenges against the international order and to reaffirm values and principles that have shaped global peace and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nThere may be limits, however, over how far NATO members are prepared to go in forging closer ties in Asia. A plan that surfaced last year for NATO to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, was blocked by France and criticised by China.\n\n(Reporting by Yukiko Toyoda and John Geddie; Editing by

At NATO's inception, the world had experienced a catastrophic war that claimed between 35 and 60 million lives and destroyed countless villages, towns, and cities, changing the landscape of Europe. The alliance was brought into being to ensure such carnage never happened again.\n\nDuring the opening program at Mellon Auditorium, the location of the original signing of the Washington Treaty establishing the alliance, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and President Joe Biden lauded the resilience of the organization. However, the meeting comes at a time when world events are, in many ways, far more complicated. NATO is engaged in supporting a sovereign nation embroiled in a devastating war started by Russia in an unprovoked act of aggression. While the Kremlin is wreaking terror in Ukraine, it is also threatening NATO countries with tactical nuclear weapons, a real danger not as imminent in 1949. China, not a global threat in the late 1940s, is very much one now. And Iran and North Korea pose significant menace to their neighbors and the world at large.\n\nAs it was last year, Ukraine is the elephant in the room. \"NATO is desperate to do more for Ukraine but is struggling to find new ways. Already, NATO allies provide 99% of the military support it gets. Soon, the Alliance will manage equipment deliveries. But two red lines remain: no NATO membership until the war is over, and no NATO boots on the ground there,\" the Associated Press observed. Within those margins, though, NATO has stepped up to provide more sophisticated weaponry to Kyiv.\n\nDuring remarks at the Summit Public Forum, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the audience, \"I'm also pleased to announce that, as we speak, the transfer of F-16 jets is underway, coming from Denmark, coming from the Netherlands, and those jets ... will be flying in the skies of Ukraine this summer to make sure that Ukraine can continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression.\" Then Blinken made a US policy statement missing since the Russians first illegally crossed into Ukraine more than 28 months ago:\n\n\"Let's talk about what winning means, what success is for Ukraine. And in my estimation, at least, success is a strong, independent Ukraine, increasingly integrated with Euro-Atlantic institutions - like the European Union, like NATO - and that is able to stand on its own feet, militarily, economically, democratically. Militarily we have an incredibly robust package that will be unveiled over the next couple of days at NATO that builds a very clear, strong, robust, well-lit bridge to NATO membership for Ukraine.\"\n\nThis statement is important because it provides some notion of an end state to the conflict. Unfortunately, the words come off as more aspirational than achievable. Blinken's assertion raises the question: Doesn't Ukraine first have to defeat militarily the Russian invaders holding a significant swath of Ukraine's real estate? The question has plagued the Biden administration since the beginning of the hostilities.\n\nNational Security Communications Adviser John Kirby was specific during a White House press briefing on July 8. \"I mean, we -- we want all of Ukraine's sovereign territory respected, which means we want no Russian forces in any part of Ukraine by the internationally recognized boundaries.\" Ukrainians believe those \"internationally recognized boundaries\" include all territory claimed by Ukraine pre-Russian illegal annexation of Crimea and occupation of the Donbas and Luhansk regions. Convincing Russia to give up the territory it has fought for since its invasion will be a hard sell. Consequently, the US view of victory in Ukraine is somewhere between the boilerplate aspirations of Blinken and the questionable realism of the White House.\n\nLeft unsaid by Biden during his summit opening speech was any mention of Ukraine's NATO membership. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be disappointed again if he thinks the 2024 NATO Summit will bring Kyiv closer to alliance membership. Zelensky can claim a greater NATO commitment to providing military support to his beleaguered nation. Despite the ebb and flow of ground combat, the most devastating assaults on Ukraine come from Russian glide bombs, cruise missiles, drones, and ballistic missiles. Biden's announcement during his speech that a significant increase in air defense missile systems would be part of the package being provided to Ukraine should be welcome news.\n\nNonetheless, as Defense News reported, regardless of US officials' upbeat rhetoric, the watchwords for the summit's results are \"managing expectations.\" The 2023 NATO Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, concluded with Zelensky's disappointment that a timeline for Ukraine's NATO membership was not the result. \"In order to avoid a repeat of last year, the 2024 summit in Washington has been much more closely coordinated. Multiple European officials told Defense News that planning began months earlier than usual.\"\n\nIf it is any consolation, Zelensky is receiving a solid commitment of F-16 fighters from NATO countries, albeit two years after the request and one year after the transfer of the fighters received approval. NATO has established a more streamlined and efficient pipeline for ammunition and critically needed weapons. That's the good news. The bad news is that NATO is operating in the shadow of political uncertainty among many of its members, not the least of which is the United States.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com",

has used the pomp-filled set piece in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Russia and backing for Kyiv.\n\nTheir gathering has been overshadowed by political uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden -- who will give a press conference Thursday -- fights for his own political survival.\n\nZelensky will join his NATO counterparts at a giant convention center in the heart of the US capital after getting promises of new weaponry to bolster the defense of the skies over Ukraine.\n\nBut he has called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further -- including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.\n\n\"Imagine how much we can achieve when all limitations are lifted,\" Zelensky said on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nNATO's leaders on Wednesday once again demurred from issuing his war-torn country a clear invitation to join their alliance.\n\nZelensky unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at a summit in Lithuania last year by lambasting NATO's reluctance on membership.\n\nIn a bid to soften any disappointment this time around, NATO leaders called Ukraine's path to membership \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military support \"within the next year.\"\n\nAhead of the sit-down with Zelensky, NATO will switch its focus to the growing challenge from China as it welcomes the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nNATO leaders have expressed their \"profound concern\" about the deepening ties between Beijing and Moscow.\n\nA declaration from the summit released Wednesday called China a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its supplies of dual-use goods such as microchips that can help Moscow's military.\n\nChina \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the leaders said.\n\nBeijing has already angrily rejected the accusations from NATO and says the US-led alliance is seeking an excuse to expand its influence eastwards.\n\nThe United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the threats posed by China.\n\nThe summit in Washington will be the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.\n\nSeveral initiatives including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation with the partner countries are expected to be announced.\n\nBut the Pacific leaders' presence is more about signaling NATO's greater interest in the region at a time of growing competition between Washington with Beijing.\n\nWorried by the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House after November elections, European allies see increasing their focus on China as a way of keeping the United States engaged.\n\n\"I think the message sent from NATO, from this summit, is very strong and very clear, and we are clearly defining China's responsibility when it comes to enabling Russia's war,\" NATO's outgoing secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said.", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"},

it was the first time the 32 allies had jointly labeled China a decisive enabler of Russia's war and called it an important message.\n\nHe said NATO was not an organization that imposes sanctions but added: \"At the end of the day, this will be for individual allies to make decisions, but I think the message we send from NATO from this summit is very clear.\"\n\nThe communique called on China to cease material and political support for Russia's war effort and expressed concern about China's space capabilities, referenced the rapid expansion of its nuclear arsenal, and urged Beijing to engage

China \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" it warns.\n\nSuch remarks are provocative, given the underlying threat conveyed in the message. Moreover, they are based on the false proposition that China bears responsibility for the prolonged conflict, when in fact China has remained a neutral party and it is NATO that has been continually fanning the flames of the hostilities.\n\nUnlike the United States and its NATO allies, which have been steadily supplying ever more sophisticated weaponry to Ukraine, China has never sent lethal assistance to either side, and it has exercised strict restrictions on exports of dual-use goods, including civilian drones. The normal trade relationship that it has maintained with Russia should be free from reproach as it does not target any third party, and conforms to international trade norms.\n\nActually it is NATO itself that should be blamed for the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. The military alliance, formed in 1949 to contain the former Soviet Union, should have long been dissolved along with the loss of its very reason for existence after the end of the Cold War. Yet despite decades of warnings from Russia, the alliance has transformed from a purportedly collective defense mechanism into an aggressive monster almost doubling in size since the end of the Cold War, and relentlessly pushing its armed front eastward, sowing the seeds of the current conflict.\n\nChina is neither a party to nor the creator of the Ukraine crisis. Rather, it has always worked to promote peace talks between Russia and Ukraine and a political settlement to the conflict. The peace proposals it has put forward have won endorsement and praise globally. By blaming China for enabling the ongoing conflict, NATO is trying to make people confuse black with white.\n\nInstead of China posing a security threat to Europe and the West, it is NATO that is seeking to expand to the Asia-Pacific to contain China's rise. Former NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen, in an interview last year, made no secret of the alliance's plan for Ukraine to join NATO to \"fix the Russia problem\" and after that, \"we will free up resources to address the real long-term global challenge: China\".\n\nThat explains why the alliance, despite calling itself a regional defensive organization in the North Atlantic, is seeking to open a Tokyo liaison office as part of its advance into the Asia-Pacific region. NATO has already been working with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and the Republic of Korea during its recent summits under a so-called \"partnership program\" to try to form an encirclement around China \"to tackle cross-regional challenges\".\n\nIt seems that NATO, after causing chaos in Europe, is ready to repeat the same mistake in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region aspires to peaceful development. But what NATO is doing is setting the stage for turning the region into a crucible of geopolitical competition, which will unavoidably jeopardize the region's prosperity, peace and stability.\n\nChina has been and will always be a contributor to global development and a defender of the international order. NATO should stop hyping up a \"China threat\" and refrain from stoking up confrontation with the country. Those members that have not lost their reason in the heady scent of putrefied ideology should strive to keep a tight grip on the reins of the organization, which seems intent on rushing headlong into another battle.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type":

challenge from China at a meeting with Asian partners, as they wrap up a three-day summit in Washington.\n\nThe 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled set piece in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Russia and backing for Kyiv.\n\nTheir gathering has been overshadowed by political uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden -- who will give a press conference Thursday -- fights for his own political survival.\n\nZelensky will join his NATO counterparts at a giant convention center in the heart of the US capital after getting promises of new weaponry to bolster the defense of the skies over Ukraine.\n\nBut he has called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further -- including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.\n\n\"Imagine how much we can achieve when all limitations are lifted,\" Zelensky said on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nNATO's leaders on Wednesday once again demurred from issuing his war-torn country a clear invitation to join their alliance.\n\nZelensky unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at a summit in Lithuania last year by lambasting NATO's reluctance on membership.\n\nIn a bid to soften any disappointment this time around, NATO leaders called Ukraine's path to membership \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military support \"within the next year.\"\n\n- China 'enabling' Russia -\n\nAhead of the sit-down with Zelensky, NATO will switch its focus to the growing challenge from China as it welcomes the

Russia-Ukraine War with Immense Value Katherine Forster emotionally recalls her sons going missing while hiking in Bali\n\nNATO leaders have expressed their \"profound concern\" about the deepening ties between Beijing and Moscow.\n\nA declaration from the summit released Wednesday called China a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its supplies of dual-use goods such as microchips that can help Moscow's military.\n\nChina \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the leaders said.\n\nBeijing has already angrily rejected the accusations from NATO and says the US-led alliance is seeking an excuse to expand its influence eastwards.\n\nThe United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the threats posed by China.\n\nThe summit in Washington will be the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.\n\nSeveral initiatives including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation with the partner countries are expected to be announced.\n\nBut the Pacific leaders' presence is more about signaling NATO's greater interest in the region at a time of growing competition between Washington with Beijing.\n\nWorried by the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House after November elections, European allies see increasing their focus on China as a way of keeping the United States engaged.\n\n\"I think the message sent from NATO, from this summit, is very strong and very clear, and we are clearly defining China's responsibility when it comes to enabling Russia's war,\" NATO's outgoing secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said.\n\ndel/sct/md/rsc", "source":

The NATO alliance is declaring that it is stationing civilian officers in an active war zone. What will happen if these officers come under fire? Will NATO then invoke Article 5 of the NATO treaty to declare war against Russia?\n\nIndeed, Foreign Policy quoted one NATO official as stating, \"We're going to push the idea in Washington that all allies should commit to having some kind of national planning process that brings together both the military planning and civilian planning for Article 5.\"\n\nEven as NATO floods Ukraine with weapons, the summit communique released yesterday condemned China as \"a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" and demanded that it halt shipments of \"weapons components\" to Russia.\n\nThe New York Times' David Sanger remarked that the language was \"a major departure for NATO, which until 2019 never officially mentioned China as a concern, and then only in the blandest of language.\" The communique states that China \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation.\"\n\nBeyond its breathtaking hypocrisy -- coming from powers that are pouring fuel on the fire of \"the largest war in Europe in recent history\" -- the summit's condemnation of China makes clear that NATO is preparing for war on a global scale.\n\nThe announcement that NATO will now play the leading role in organizing the Ukraine war refutes years of lying propaganda by the Biden administration, US think tanks, and the media, who have repeatedly asserted that NATO is not directly involved in the Ukraine war.\n\nIn reality, the imperialist powers have worked systematically for over a decade to provoke a war with Russia. Since 2014, NATO has been transforming Ukraine into a frontline military outpost, using the fact that Ukraine is not an official member state as a cover for arming it to the teeth.\n\nRussia's reactionary and bankrupt invasion of Ukraine was based on a series of disastrous political miscalculations. In launching the invasion, Putin, representing a faction of the Russian oligarchy, believed that a show of military strength would convince his \"Western partners\" to see \"reason\" and halt the expansion of NATO to Russia's doorstep and the militarization of Eastern Europe.\n\nBut the US and its imperialist allies are not interested in peaceful solutions to the conflict. They have consistently sought to prevent any negotiated settlement of the war, regardless of the cost in Ukrainian lives.\n\nThe NATO powers have also made great miscalculations of their own. They believed that by funneling tens of billions of dollars in weapons to Ukraine, they could quickly impose a \"strategic defeat\" on Russia, leading to the collapse of the Putin government and the destabilization and even dissolution of the country.\n\nLast year's NATO summit in Vilnius was intended as a \"victors' summit\" to celebrate the triumphant \"spring offensive\" launched by Ukraine just weeks beforehand. But the offensive turned into a bloody debacle, with Ukrainian troops thrown against Russian lines without air cover and slaughtered by the thousands.\n\nNow, with hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians killed, Kiev has largely run out of live bodies to use as cannon fodder, despite the criminal bands of recruiters roaming every Ukrainian city and town, press-ganging men into war.\n\nEven as they escalate the war, the various governments assembled in Washington are riven by deep internal crises and despised by their own populations.\n\nThe government of Emmanuel Macron in France just suffered a huge electoral defeat, the result of broad popular opposition to the war and the corresponding attack on pensions and other social programs. History demonstrates, however, that governments facing severe internal crises often seek in war a solution to their internal maladies.\n\nIn the UK, the Conservative Party government of Rishi Sunak was similarly overwhelmingly repudiated in elections held last week. It has been replaced, however, by a Labour Party government that has come to power despite a sharp fall in its own vote total. The new prime minister, Keir Starmer, is attending the NATO summit as his first official act, making clear that he will continue all the essential policies of his predecessor.\n\nAnd the president of the United States, Biden, is trying to beat back growing calls within his own party to step down as the Democrats' presidential candidate in elections only four months out. Biden is hoping that a demonstration of bellicosity and warmongering at the NATO summit will counter concerns within the ruling class about the impact of his evidently declining mental capacities.\n\nOne factor in the deliberations within the American ruling class over Biden's fate is concern that an electoral defeat could have consequences for the war against Russia, given Trump's \"transactional\" approach to foreign policy. While Trump and the Republicans are no less committed to imperialist war than the Democrats, there are discussions in the media of the need to make NATO and the Ukraine war \"Trump-proof\" through a massive commitment of military and financial aid.\n\nAmidst the various maneuvers and changes in personnel, the leaders of the imperialist countries are demonstrating that the war policies of the ruling class are completely impervious to popular opinion. \"Plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose\" -- or in this case, \"The more things change, the more war escalates.\"\n\nAnd every single one of the \"dignitaries\" assembled in Washington is dripping with blood, complicit in financing and politically justifying the genocide in Gaza that the British medical journal, The Lancet, estimates has led to the deaths of 186,000 Palestinians. One consequence of the genocide is the refutation for all time of the claim that imperialist foreign policy has anything to do with \"democracy\" and \"human rights,\" in Ukraine or anywhere else.\n\nThese despised, criminal governments are launching a war on the working class alongside the escalation of war abroad. In an op-ed published Wednesday in the New York Times, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan boasted about the expansion of NATO's military spending:\n\nIn 2023, defense expenditures of NATO nations in Europe and Canada grew by 8 percent. This year, they are set to grow by 18 percent. ... In the next five years, our NATO allies will add over 650 fifth-generation F-35 aircraft, over 1,000 air defense systems, nearly 50 warships and submarines, 1,200 battle tanks, 11,300 combat vehicles, and nearly 2,000 artillery systems.\n\nAnd how is all of this to be paid for? Through an all-out assault on the social position of the working class, which will only intensify class tensions all over the world.\n\nThe NATO summit confirms the critical importance of the July 24 rally against the genocide in Gaza, called by the World Socialist Web Site and Socialist Equality Party in response to the visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress.\n\nIn a statement on the demonstration and meeting published yesterday, WSWS International Editorial Board Chairman David North explained that its aim is to \"provide a strategic direction for the building of a mass movement to end the Gaza genocide, which is inextricably linked to the global eruption of imperialist militarism, the relentless escalation toward nuclear war against Russia and China, and the assault on the democratic and social rights of the working class.\"\n\nThis must be the response of workers and youth to the NATO war summit.\n\nThe WSWS urges all its readers to attend the rally and to sign up and help promote and build it by filling out the form below.\n\nRead moreStop the US-NATO escalation toward nuclear war!

The United States was once deeply skeptical about whether Ukraine was ready to become a member, and while questions remain, more and more U.S. and European officials believe that the country will eventually be able to join.\n\n\"Ukraine's future is in NATO,\" members said in a communiqu\u00e9, adding that \"we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.\"\n\nThe document does not lay out an exact timeline for membership, which the Ukrainians have wanted, but it says the allies will continue to support Ukraine's progress on \"democratic and security sector reforms.\"\n\nU.S. and allied officials negotiated the commitments to Ukraine with new urgency, given the uncertainty over whether President Joe Biden, a staunch opponent of Russia in its war, can win reelection this fall, according to officials in Washington.\n\nThe officials had said it was critical that leaders of the 32 member nations who have gathered in Washington this week used strong language to signal that Ukraine has a viable path to joining the alliance, even if it does not happen immediately because of the war.\n\nThey also said the leaders must agree to concrete steps to ensure the alliance is the main organizer of military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine rather than the United States.\n\nLooming over the conversations is the specter of a second Donald Trump presidency. Trump has expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, criticized Ukraine and expressed doubts about sending any additional U.S. military aid to the nation. And in his first term, Trump talked about withdrawing the United States from NATO.\n\nBecause of these concerns, officials and analysts said that \"Trump-proofing\" the alliance and aid to Ukraine was an important element of the talks this week. \"Ukraine can and will stop Putin, especially with our full, collective support,\" Biden said in a speech Tuesday night.\n\nBeyond solidifying foundations that could endure into a Trump presidency, the leaders are also trying to head off criticism from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, who last year accused the alliance of waffling on a promise to give his country membership.\n\nBut a more amicable version of Zelenskyy arrived in Washington on Tuesday. He expressed thanks for the support given to Ukraine so far while prodding the administration to continue relaxing its restrictions on the use of U.S. weapons in Russia and sending immediate aid.\n\n\"It's time to step out of the shadows to make strong decisions to act and not wait for November,\" he said in a speech, referring to the U.S. presidential election. \"We must be strong and uncompromising all together.\"\n\nUkraine's path to NATO membership\n\nThe debate about the communiqu\u00e9 revolved around whether to say that Ukraine has an \"irreversible\" path to NATO membership and what conditions to attach to that.\n\nThe alliance grants membership only by unanimous consent, and U.S. and other officials have been wary of what Hungary might say. The country's prime minister, Viktor Orban, visited Russia and China before arriving in Washington and is more sympathetic than other NATO leaders to Putin.\n\nU.S. and allied officials say that in any case, a mutual defense clause in the NATO treaty makes it difficult to allow Ukraine in while it is at war. The alliance wants to avoid a direct war with Russia, a nuclear power.\n\nCommitting to more aid\n\nJens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of NATO, urged top diplomats at an alliance meeting in Prague in May to commit to collectively giving Ukraine 100 billion euros (about $1.1 billion) in military aid over the next five years.\n\nHe could not get consensus. But officials agreed to give Ukraine \"a minimum base-line funding\" of 40 billion euros within the next year.\n\nIncreasing members' military spending\n\nThere is another numbers concern: Trump has often criticized NATO members for not spending more on defense.\n\nThe allies agreed in 2014 to spend at least 2% of their economic output, or gross domestic product, on their militaries. At the time, only the U.S., Britain and Greece were meeting the goal.\n\nDuring the 2018 NATO summit, Trump railed against allies for that failure and then surprised leaders by demanding an increase of the benchmark to 4%, a goal that would have been out of reach for many alliance members. He said the United States would \"go its own way\" in 2019 if military spending from other NATO countries did not rise.\n\nTrump so upset NATO leaders that they abandoned plans to hold a 70th anniversary summit the next year in Washington, fearing he would ruin it.\n\nBiden noted in his Tuesday speech that in 2020, when he was elected, only nine countries had reached the 2% goal. Now, 23 of the 32 member nations will spend at least that. \"It's remarkable progress,\" he said.\n\nA new command\n\nTo guard against any future decline of the United States' role in supporting Ukraine, the alliance is setting up a mission in Germany to coordinate assistance.\n\nAfter Russia's invasion in February 2022, the United States took the lead in organizing military aid. That assistance has been coordinated through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which is run by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and includes representatives from allied nations. While that group will continue, NATO is setting up a separate office in Germany to coordinate aid of all kinds to Ukraine.\n\n\"The name of the game is to build up deterrence against Russia as strongly as possible in order to withstand a lack of U.S. participation, or, worse, attempts at or actual withdrawal,\" said Evelyn Farkas, a former senior Pentagon official in the Obama administration who is now head of the McCain Institute, a democracy advocacy group.\n\nKeeping Asian allies Ccose\n\nCreating a tighter web between NATO and Asia-Pacific countries allied with the United States -- Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand -- also helps hedge against any uncertainty that would arise from a second Trump term, Farkas said.\n\nA U.S. president might find it harder to extricate the United States from commitments and partnerships if NATO and Asia-Pacific allies of the United States spoke with one voice on important issues, such as Russia or China.\n\nAlthough Trump expresses admiration for Xi Jinping, China's leader, he seems willing to appear tougher on China than Russia, such as when he imposed tariffs on some Chinese products.\n\nDocuments from NATO meetings of recent years have included language criticizing China. European nations have grown more suspicious of China because of its support of Russia. And they increasingly see China's belligerent statements and military actions toward the democratic island of Taiwan as a kind of parallel to Putin's hostility toward Ukraine.\n\nThe summit communiqu\u00e9 said that the People's Republic of China had become \"a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called 'no limits' partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\"\n\n\"The PRC continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security,\" it added.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard,\" they added.\n\nChina has refused to condemn Russia's invasion and last year released a paper calling for a \"political settlement\" to the conflict, which Western countries said could enable Russia to retain much of the territory it has seized in Ukraine.\n\nChina and Russia's strategic partnership has grown closer since the invasion.\n\nBeijing presents itself as a neutral party in the war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nIt has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nBut that economic partnership has come under close scrutiny from the West in recent months, with Washington vowing to go after financial institutions that facilitate Moscow's war effort.\n\nThe United States and Europe have also accused Beijing of selling components and equipment necessary to keep Moscow's military production afloat.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in April this included \"machine tools, semiconductors, other dual-use items that have helped Russia rebuild the defence industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade\".\n\nBeijing has denied claims it is aiding Russia's fighting in Ukraine and insisted it won't accept \"criticism or pressure\" over its ties with Moscow.\n\nAnd on Thursday, its foreign ministry accused the alliance of \"prejudice, smearing and provocation\".\n\n\"NATO's rhetoric about China's responsibility in Ukraine is unjustified and malicious,\" spokesman Lin Jian said.\n\n\"We urge NATO to reflect on the root causes of the crisis and its own actions, listen carefully to the just voice of the international community, and take concrete actions to ease the situation, instead of shifting the blame to others.\"", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

If invoked by an ally, it provides for an attack on one or more allies being treated as an attack on all member states.\n\nIt has only been invoked once, by the US in the aftermath of the Sept 11 in 2001 al-Qaeda attacks.\n\nThe communique singles out Russia, saying the Kremlin \"remains the most significant and direct threat to Allies' security.\" Its now over two-year invasion of Ukraine, the document says, \"has shattered peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and gravely undermined global security.\"\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken earlier Wednesday announced that F-16 fighter jets long-awaited by Kyiv are headed to the war-torn nation to aid efforts seeking to roll back Russia's invasion.\n\nThe US-built jets are being supplied by Denmark and the Netherlands. They will be flown by US-trained Ukrainian pilots.\n\nAdditional details were not immediately available due to what the leaders of the three nations described as \"operational security concerns.\"\n\nNATO allies pledged in their declaration to provide Ukraine with over $43 billion in funding within the next year and vowed to \"provide sustainable levels of security assistance for Ukraine to prevail.\"\n\nThe alliance said Iran and North Korea are \"fuelling\" the Russian war effort by providing Moscow with \"direct military support\" that includes military drones and munitions.\n\nBut it pointed in particular to China, which the alliance said \"has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine through its so-called 'no limits' partnership and its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base.\"\n\n\"We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" it said, referring to China by its official acronym.\n\n\"This includes the transfer of dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment, and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia's defence sector. The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" it added.\n\nThe next NATO leader-level summit will take place in The Hague, the Netherlands in June 2025, followed by a meeting in Turkiye at an undisclosed time.\n\nThe allies reaffirmed their support for \"Allied regional efforts aimed at upholding security, safety, stability and freedom of navigation in the Black Sea region including, as appropriate, through the 1936 Montreux Convention. The treaty governs the transit of ships through the Istanbul Strait and the Canakkale Strait.\n\n\"We will continue to counter, deter, defend and respond to threats and challenges posed by terrorists and terrorist organisations based on a combination of prevention, protection and denial measures with determination, resolve and in solidarity,\" it added. - Bernama, Anadolu", "source": {"uri":

Moscow says its improving relations with China and North Korea are not aimed at any third country.\n\nIn written remarks to Reuters, the Japanese leader said that \"Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,\" urging the global community not to accept attempts by Russia and its allies to sabotage the established international order. He particularly pointed to Russia's growing cooperation with North Korea as a cause for concern.\n\n\"The securities of the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific are inseparable, and Russia's aggression against Ukraine and its deepened military cooperation with North Korea are strong reminders of that... Japan is determined to strengthen its cooperation with NATO and its partners,\" he stated. The West has repeatedly accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with weapons that are used on the front line, claims that both Russia and North Korea have denied.\n\nWhile not naming China, Kishida noted that \"some\" other countries also bolster the alleged Russian threat by allegedly supplying dual-use goods which can be used for military purposes. This accusation has been repeatedly levelled by Western leaders at Beijing, which denies doing so. Kishida called on NATO and its partners to unite against \"international actors fueling Russia's attempt to change the status quo by force.\"\n\nTokyo has taken a tough stance in the Ukraine conflict, siding with NATO, which has insisted that if Moscow were to achieve victory in Ukraine, it could move on to attack members of the bloc.\n\nMoscow has denounced those claims as \"complete nonsense,\" and has defended its ties with Asian partners as normal international relationships. Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed last month that the country's cooperation with China in particular is \"not directed against anyone\" but is the \"main stabilizing factor on the international stage\" and is focused on the interests of the people.\n\nOn the other hand, Russia has often criticized Western efforts at expanded global influence, naming NATO's expansion toward its borders and interest in Ukraine as major reasons for the launch of its military operation in February 2022.\n\nDuring his visit to Vietnam last month, Putin also drew attention to NATO's growing focus on the Asia-Pacific and attempts to \"put together a bloc system\" in the region, which he called a security threat to Russia and all Asian countries.\n\n\"NATO is already moving there as if to a permanent place of residence...

In written remarks ahead of his attendance at a NATO summit in Washington DC this week, Kishida expressed concerns about regional security threats becoming increasingly intertwined.\n\n\"The securities of the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific are inseparable, and Russia's aggression against Ukraine and its deepened military cooperation with North Korea are strong reminders of that,\" Kishida said. He stressed Japan's commitment to bolstering its cooperation with NATO and its partners.\n\nKishida also warned that the international community should not tolerate efforts by some countries to disrupt the established global order, suggesting that the current situation in Ukraine could foreshadow similar conflicts in East Asia. He emphasized the importance of global cooperation to address emerging security threats, including cyber-attacks and space conflicts.\n\nThe Indo-Pacific Four (IP4) -- Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand -- will join NATO leaders at the summit on July 10-11. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol indicated that he plans to discuss the threat posed by North Korea's growing ties with Russia.\n\nLast month, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un signed a mutual defense pledge with Russia during President Vladimir Putin's visit to Pyongyang. Kim expressed his full support for Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have accused Pyongyang of supplying ballistic missiles and artillery shells to Russia for use in Ukraine. They also fear Moscow might provide support for North Korea's nuclear missile development in return. Additionally, Washington has accused China of providing non-lethal assistance, such as drone and missile technology, to Russia, aiding its military efforts in Ukraine. China has denied supplying weaponry to any party.\n\nWithout naming China, Kishida mentioned that \"some countries\" have allegedly transferred dual-use civilian-military goods to Russia, serving as a \"lifeline\" for its war in Ukraine. He called for a strategic approach to address these issues, considering the roles of all international actors involved.\n\n\"The geographical boundary of 'Euro-Atlantic' or 'Indo-Pacific' is no longer relevant in safeguarding global peace and security. Japan and Indo-Pacific partners can play a significant role for NATO allies from this perspective,\" Kishida stated.\n\nWhile constrained by decades of pacifism, Japan has refrained from supplying lethal aid to Ukraine. Instead, Tokyo has provided financial assistance, spearheaded post-war reconstruction efforts, and contributed to NATO's fund for non-lethal equipment, such as anti-drone detection systems. Tokyo has also warned of potential conflicts in East Asia, particularly concerning China's assertive territorial claims, including Taiwan.\n\n\"This summit is a critical opportunity for Japan, the U.S., and other NATO allies to confront ongoing challenges to the international order and to reaffirm values and principles that have shaped global peace and prosperity,\" Kishida said.\n\nHowever, there are limits to how far NATO members are willing to forge closer ties in Asia.

The tactic of escalating Moscow's anxiety about Ukraine's impending NATO membership had proven successful. As NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told a European Parliament joint committee meeting: \"So he (Putin) went to war to prevent NATO, more NATO, close to his borders....\"\n\nStoltenberg inadvertently unveiled the truth. The conflict did not begin because Putin sought to resurrect the Soviet Union or out of fear of Ukrainian democracy. Stoltenberg and the leadership of NATO were fully aware that Russia would eventually be compelled to act according to its security imperatives and invade Ukraine to alleviate the NATO threat at its borders.\n\nThe cunning aspect of this plan was a deception. NATO never had any intention of granting membership to Ukraine. Therefore, even the most fervent supporters of NATO cannot deny that it was NATO's deliberate provocation that ignited the war.\n\nThe next steps appeared pretty straightforward.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, informed lawmakers during closed-door briefings before the invasion on February 2 and 3, 2022, that an anticipated full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine might lead to Kyiv's capture in just 72 hours.\n\nThe strategy entailed deliberately allowing Ukraine to collapse, which would prompt the West to impose devastating economic sanctions. The objectives were the destruction of the Russian economy, the resignation of Putin, and, ultimately, the elimination of Russia as a European power\n\nAfter Russia's unsuccessful attempt to capture Kiev, there was a surge of wild optimism within NATO circles. There was a prevailing notion that Russia's military strength was not as formidable as previously believed. Thus, NATO saw an opportunity not only to destroy the Russian economy but also to defeat Russia militarily.\n\nThe US and its NATO allies decided to set aside any pretenses and fully engage in the conflict, providing Ukraine with modern weaponry, intelligence, training, financing, and all necessary resources to bolster NATO's chances of prevailing, all while upholding a facade of plausible deniability. Ukraine was supposed to bear the brunt of battle and pay the cost in blood and destruction.\n\nThe plan held considerable plausibility, and the data supported it. In 2022, NATO's defense budget exceeded Russia's by 13-fold (NATO's one trillion dollars versus Russia's $75 billion). The combined GDP of all 31 members amounted to a staggering $46 trillion. In comparison, Russia's GDP was a mere two trillion dollars. The population of NATO countries was 1.2 billion, while Russia had 145 million. Judging by the numbers, Russia appeared to be an easy target.\n\nPhase II. Apprehension\n\nDespite the numbers, the multibillion-dollar investment, the massive supply of modern weaponry, the hundreds of thousands dead and wounded, and the massive destruction of Ukraine's infrastructure, none of the NATO objectives have been achieved two and a half years later. Putin's grip on power remains unshaken, and the sanctions have failed to significantly affect the Russian economy. Moreover, Russia is successfully building a formidable military-industrial complex, engineering and producing weapons that often surpass Western designs in capability and innovation.\n\nThis sobering reality forced NATO to reshape the conflict and develop a new strategy. The new approach revolved around a protracted war of attrition aimed at debilitating Russia both economically and militarily.\n\nIt is becoming exceedingly evident that America and its Western allies became a hostage of sanctions and found themselves trapped between the continuation of war and economic and military realities. From this untenable situation, they could see no exit and continued doing the same things, expecting different results. The European Union has now enforced its 14th set of sanctions, prompting one to question what this latest round can achieve that the previous 13 could not. Meanwhile, NATO is in the process of organizing the provision of F-16s and other advanced weaponry to Ukraine.\n\nPhase III. Despair\n\nThe conflict has now escalated to its most critical stage when desperate people do desperate things. As the tables turned in favor of Russia, NATO is running out of options. The situation led to a series of reckless and incendiary remarks from Western officials and NATO leaders advocating for a significant escalation of the conflict beyond Ukraine's borders by launching attacks on Russia territory using long-range missiles supplied by NATO countries.\n\nThe US and its NATO partners are delusional and fail to realize that they are facing an unwinnable situation. It is the immutable fact that a nuclear-armed state cannot be defeated. If Ukraine loses, it will be perceived as NATO's defeat. Conversely, if Russia falters, it will inevitably result in a nuclear war. Two and half years ago, NATO leaders provoked the Russian invasion, leading to a tragic outcome. Now, as to validate their lack of sanity, they are frantically escalating the conflict, which may lead to a catastrophe. Clearly, regardless of how we analyze the situation, it is becoming increasingly dire for the US and its allies militarily and geopolitically.\n\nDuring the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe on December 5, 1994, Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, vehemently accused Clinton of \"trying to split [the] continent again through NATO's eastward expansion.\" President Biden has taken it a step further; he is, by inciting conflict with Russia, on a mission to split the world.\n\nThe conflict has facilitated the creation of a formidable anti-Western coalition currently consisting of Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Other countries will likely join it in the future as the war continues. And it will, as NATO has been better at starting wars than at knowing how to finish them. If the coalition evolves into an alliance, it will surpass NATO in terms of human and natural resources, economic power, and military capabilities. Ultimately, it might be America's most critical geopolitical blunder ever, as this rival may weaken America's dominance and diminish its influence.\n\nIn his essay \"Perpetual Peace,\" philosopher Immanuel Kant argued three centuries ago that humanity's path to universal peace would be through human insight or catastrophic conflict.\n\nRegretfully, as long as we are led by untutored people who lack moral and strategic foresight and fail to grasp the perilous nature of the policies they promote, and as long as we have a military alliance that, after fulfilling its original purpose, seeks out new adversaries to justify its existence, peace by way of human insight appears increasingly remote.", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"},

"title": "Zelensky to take center stage as NATO summit also looks to Asia", "body": "NATO leaders on Thursday will hold talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and turn their attention to the challenge from China at a meeting with Asian partners, as they wrap up a three-day summit in Washington.\n\nThe 32-nation alliance has used the pomp-filled set piece in the US capital to showcase its resolve against Russia and backing for Kyiv.\n\nTheir gathering has been overshadowed by political uncertainty in the United States as President Joe Biden -- who will give a press conference Thursday -- fights for his own political survival.\n\nZelensky will join his NATO counterparts at a giant convention center in the heart of the US capital after getting promises of new weaponry to bolster the defense of the skies over Ukraine.\n\nBut he has called on Kyiv's backers, especially the United States, to go further -- including by giving his outgunned forces greater scope to strike inside Russia.\n\n\"Imagine how much we can achieve when all limitations are lifted,\" Zelensky said on the sidelines of the summit.\n\nNATO's leaders on Wednesday once again demurred from issuing his war-torn country a clear invitation to join their alliance.\n\nZelensky unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at a summit in Lithuania last year by lambasting NATO's reluctance on membership.\n\nIn a bid to soften any disappointment this time around, NATO leaders called Ukraine's path to membership \"irreversible.\"\n\nThey also pledged to provide Kyiv a minimum of 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military support \"within the next year.\"\n\n- China 'enabling' Russia -\n\nAhead of the sit-down with Zelensky, NATO will switch its focus to the growing challenge from China as it welcomes the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nNATO leaders have expressed their \"profound concern\" about the deepening ties between Beijing and Moscow.\n\nA declaration from the summit released Wednesday called China a \"decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" through its supplies of dual-use goods such as microchips that can help Moscow's military.\n\nChina \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the leaders said.\n\nBeijing has already angrily rejected the accusations from NATO and says the US-led alliance is seeking an excuse to expand its influence eastwards.\n\nThe United States has been pushing its European allies for years to pay closer attention to the threats posed by China.\n\nThe summit in Washington will be the third such gathering attended by leaders from the four Asia-Pacific partners.\n\nSeveral initiatives including bolstering cooperation against cyberattacks and disinformation with the partner countries are expected to be announced.\n\nBut the Pacific leaders' presence is more about signaling NATO's greater interest in the region at a time of growing competition between Washington with Beijing.\n\nWorried by the potential return of Donald Trump to the White House after November elections, European allies see increasing their focus on China as a way of keeping the United States engaged.\n\n\"I think the message sent from NATO, from this summit, is very strong and very clear, and we are clearly defining China's responsibility when it comes to enabling Russia's war,\" NATO's outgoing secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said.\n\ndel/sct/md/rsc\n\nMore from this section\n\n[Not Banned] Failed to Detect Location 12 Error Fixed

But the move was shot down at the time by French President Emmanuel Macron, who openly worried that putting a NATO office in China's backyard would raise tensions with Beijing.\n\nThe debate over whether NATO should create new footprints in the Indo-Pacific comes as Washington and its allies grapple with how NATO should respond to the perceived growing threat from China, which doesn't fit neatly into the alliance's historic core missions.\n\nYet some alliance officials, including Stoltenberg and top U.S. officials, are pushing NATO to expand its conversations on China. China remains a top investment partner of Europe, but its more assertive regional posture under President Xi Jinping has unnerved many European leaders, and Beijing's indirect support of Russia amid its war in Ukraine has further isolated China politically across the continent.\n\n\"I think we have been too naive on Russia, too naive on China,\" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations on Tuesday.\n\nKey U.S. allies in the Indo-Pacific, meanwhile, including both Japan and South Korea, have doubled down on support for Ukraine and expanded their own defense spending with an eye toward boosting cooperation with Europe.\n\n\"Japan, [South] Korea, and Australia are all on the road to invest 2 percent of their GDP on defense, a historic step forward,\" U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said at an event at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday. \"Put simply, the ties between the United States, Europe, and the Indo-Pacific have never been more important or more interrelated than they are today.\"\n\nChina has appeared in two straight NATO summit communiqu\u00e9s -- and is likely to show up in the text that follows the Washington summit, too. The idea of putting a NATO office in Tokyo is not on the agenda at this week's gathering -- which includes four Indo-Pacific nations as guests -- but Billstrom said allies are likely to bring it up with France again soon. Two other NATO officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the move.\n\nThe office isn't seen as a game-changer for foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific, but it would give NATO a toehold in a region that it has historically avoided but has become more strategically important, because of both China's saber-rattling and its and North Korea's support of Russia. But the impetus for the office is coming from within NATO -- not from the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"It's not something anyone is pursuing at present,\" said one Indo-Pacific nation diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity to talk about ongoing policy debates. \"China's demonstration [that] it is committed to reconstituting the Russian military-industrial base and supporting their war on Ukraine has been sufficient to demonstrate that the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic theaters are irrevocably linked and that the security challenges we are facing are not defined by geographic theaters. So no need for the tokenism of an office in Tokyo.\"\n\nThe French position -- as usual -- is complicated. \"I am not sure Macron will move,\" said Camille Grand, a distinguished policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and former NATO assistant secretary-general. \"The French have identified this rather small issue of the Tokyo office as the symbol of their reluctance to see a bigger role for NATO in Asia.\"\n\nYet the French probably see a bigger role for NATO in Asia, and Macron has taken a much more hawkish turn against Russia in recent months as he portrays the Ukrainian conflict as existential for Europe's security. \"This does not mean that they fundamentally disagree that NATO should not pay more attention to China,\" Grand said.\n\nBillstrom batted down the notion that NATO planting a flag in the Indo-Pacific would be a provocative signal to China. \"Putting up a liaison office is not the same as putting a major naval base or a major military airfield in position,\" he said. \"This is a question of showing the political interest [in the region].\"\n\nThere has been greater military alignment within NATO over maritime deployments to the Indo-Pacific, including between British and French aircraft carriers scheduled to ship out in the next two to three years. Germany, Spain, and France will also send out a force of a dozen fighter aircraft and supporting planes on a tour of the Indo-Pacific; Italy and Germany will send two large ships to the U.S.-led Rim of the Pacific exercise, which is taking place through the end of August. Russia has recently countered with its own exercises near Hawaii.\n\n\"The question of security in the Euro-Atlantic region and Indo-Pacific are not just closely interlinked -- they are two sides of the same coin,\" Billstrom said.\n\nTop officials from three Indo-Pacific nations -- Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea -- are in attendance at the NATO summit in Washington this week as official guests. (Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was also invited but opted to skip the summit.) North Korea's support to Russia in its war in Ukraine is an agenda topic, too. Billstrom said NATO should also reach out to countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, which \"all, for various reasons, feel the breath of China down their necks.\"\n\nBut former U.S. President Donald Trump's acolytes have pushed for the United States to focus more on the Indo-Pacific -- and have brushed aside the idea that European powers can have an impact in the region. \"With respect, I don't think what the foreign minister of Estonia says about Taiwan is going to matter much to China,\" Elbridge Colby, a former Trump administration Pentagon official who now heads up the Marathon Initiative, said at a Foreign Policy event on Monday.\n\nAnd some experts believe that European shows of force in the Indo-Pacific are masking the reality that within NATO's military command structure, no one is seriously considering that European powers will get militarily involved in the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"There's no real focus on Asia, no one talking about Asia at those commands in any real way,\" said Ian Bowers, a senior researcher at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies. \"The real reality is there is no consensus on Europe when it comes to China. And that is magnified when it comes to the security sphere.\"\n\nBillstrom said the United States is looking for political support -- not boots on the ground -- to help handle China's threats in the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"The big question actually for NATO is: What can NATO do if the U.S. becomes involved in a contingency in Asia where those enablers that the U.S. provides suddenly get dragged over to the wrong side of the world for NATO?\" said Bowers, using a military term to describe U.S. elements that help support European combat forces. \"And what happens then? I think NATO has not figured that out in any way, shape, or form.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignpolicy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Foreign Policy"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It is a major departure for NATO, which until 2019 never officially mentioned China as a concern, and then only in the blandest of language.\n\nNow, for the first time, the alliance has joined in Washington's denunciations of China's military support for Russia.\n\nBut the declaration contains an implicit threat that China's growing support for Russia will come at a cost. China \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the declaration said, particularly calling out \"its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\"\n\nThe NATO declaration did not specify what those costs would be, although the natural first step would be economic sanctions that barred China from parts of global markets.\n\nEven a year ago, European leaders were hesitant to challenge Beijing, especially nations like Germany that view China as a critical market for high-end cars and luxury goods.\n\nMany European leaders initially dismissed the agreement reached in early 2022, just before the Beijing Olympics, for a \"partnership without limits\" signed by President Vladimir Putin and President Xi Jinping. Even President Joe Biden said he had his doubts that the two countries, with a long history of enmity, could work together. In March 2023, during a trip to Canada, he said, \"I think we vastly exaggerate\" the partnership.\n\n\"I've been hearing now for the past three months about 'China is going to provide significant weapons to Russia and they're gonna' -- a lot of talk about that,\" Biden added. \"They haven't yet. Doesn't mean they won't, but they haven't yet.\"\n\nBut 29 months after the invasion of Ukraine, that view has changed drastically. While China has heeded warnings not to supply Russia with full weapons systems, it has done everything short of that, providing computer chips, advanced software and the components needed for Russia to rebuild a defense industrial base that churned out faulty and outdated equipment.\n\nThe intelligence evidence was provided to NATO countries by the Biden administration, in an effort to win over skeptics who argued that China was not a central player in the war. That succeeded, but only after the United States published the names, in a Treasury Department economic sanctions order, of Chinese front companies and manufacturers that were funneling the technology to Russia.\n\n\"The declaration demonstrates that NATO allies now collectively understand this challenge and are calling on the PRC to cease this activity,\" Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser, said Wednesday afternoon, referring to the People's Republic of China. \"If this PRC support continues, it will degrade its relations across Europe, and the United States will continue to impose sanctions on PRC entities involved in this activity, in coordination with our European allies.\"\n\nThe declaration also blames China for \"malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation\" aimed at the United States and Europe.\n\nChina has denied that it is a major factor in the war and Chinese officials have, publicly and privately, accused Washington of deep hypocrisy, noting the tens of billions of dollars in ammunition, missile systems, tanks and soon F-16 jets that the United States is giving to Ukrainian fighters.\n\nIn May, when American sanctions were imposed, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, called the U.S. accusations \"hypocritical and highly irresponsible.\" But he did not deny the specifics.\n\nThe standoff over China's role in Ukraine is threatening to unwind whatever goodwill Biden developed with Xi when they met in November in California. At the time, Biden warned him privately about interfering in the 2024 presidential election, but the evidence was not yet available that China was becoming a major force, alongside Iran and North Korea, in supplying the Russian war effort.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_e_sanger@seattletimes.com", "name": "David E.

A NATO-IP4 session is set for Thursday.\n\nIssues to be discussed between NATO and the IP4 include resilience, cyber, disinformation and technology, according to a short briefing from a U.S. official last week.\n\n\"Resilience\" could include the supply of industrial products or arms, particularly given that the Asian partners all use NATO-standard weapons and systems. Atlantic-Pacific cooperation is already underway in the cybersecurity field as well.\n\nPolitically, the continental outreach represents a growing unity of purpose among of East Asian, European and North American democracies against the challenges posed by authoritarian states to the global status quo, most particularly, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Geographically, it represents a unity of maritime powers against the Eurasian continental powers of China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.\n\nWhile geopolitics will be at the fore in Washington, economic considerations will be very much a background presence.\n\nRussia is a major player in only two global sectors, arms and energy. Conversely, China, the world's No. 2 economy behind the U.S., is a central player in multiple global supply chains and a constraint on all parties' actions.\n\nNational agendas\n\nJapan -- which on Monday followed up security deals with Australia and the UK by signing a third with the Philippines -- will be represented in Washington by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\n\nTokyo hosts the largest number of U.S. troops deployed overseas and Mr. Kishida has expressed consistent dismay at Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which he fears could encourage similar aggression and challenges to recognized international borders in East Asia as well.\n\nAccording to Tokyo's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Kishida will \"reaffirm with NATO allies and other partners the recognition that the securities of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific are inseparable.\"\n\nWhile China has not armed Russia, Mr. Kishida in a Tuesday interview with Reuters raised the issue of Chinese dual-use exports, which have offered the Russian defense industry \"a lifeline\" in the face of punishing U.S. and Western economic sanctions.\n\n\"It is necessary to grapple with such situations in a multi-faceted and strategic manner, taking a panoramic view that considers the full range of international actors fueling Russia's attempt to change the status quo by force,\" he said.\n\nJapan already has considerable ties to NATO: Under 2023's Individually Tailored Partnership Program, 16 areas of cooperation were agreed upon, including arms control, nonproliferation, cybersecurity and space. Japanese media reports say that countering disinformation - \"cognitive warfare\" - is also on Mr. Kishida's agenda at the summit.\n\nJapan is also expanding defense links with European nations.\n\nIt signed a troop and equipment transfer agreement with the U.K. in 2023, and an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement in Germany this January. Mitsubishi is building Japan's next-generation stealth fighter in partnership with the U.K. and Italy.\n\nWhile South Korea cannot boast the same number of security linkages, President Yoon Suk-yeol, who is visiting the ongoing U.S.-led RIMPAC military exercises en route to the summit, will likely get a warm welcome in the NATO conference halls.\n\nHis unprecedented outreach to Japan, despite considerable political hurdles at home, has been welcomed by the Biden administration. Alarmed by June's North Korea-Russia summit that resulted in the announcement of a bilateral security partnership, Mr. Yoon says he will raise the prospect of cross-continental proliferation linkages with NATO.\n\nIn a pre-departure interview with Reuters, Mr. Yoon stated, \"Military co-operation between Russia and North Korea poses a distinct threat and grave challenge to the peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Europe.\"\n\nNorth Korea has supplied Russia with artillery ammunition and rockets, and rumors persist that it may deploy military engineers and laborers to occupied Ukraine.\n\nSeoul has not directly fed the war, but has supplied artillery ammunition to the Pentagon, which transferred it on to Kyiv. Mr. Yoon said his future stance toward supplying Ukraine directly depends on how North Korea-Russia relations evolve.\n\nNATO and South Korea are already cooperating on cyber security: South Korean troops joined NATO's key cyber drill in Estonia last year and Seoul's intelligence agency will host NATO operatives for a cyber exercise in September.\n\nMr. Yoon's office says he will hold as many as 10 bilateral meetings with fellow leaders during his Washington visit.\n\nThe Washington mission of New Zealand Premier Christopher Luxon, who took office in November 2023, is similar to Mr. Yoon's. It includes \"speed dating\" with U.S. politicians from both parties and NATO leaders, he told local media.\n\nThe newly-minted leader will also be discussing New Zealand's financial support to Ukraine and its training of Ukrainian troops.\n\nAn absentee and an opponent\n\nThe highest-profile absentee in Washington will be Australia's Mr. Albanese; Canberra will instead be represented by Defense Minister Robert Marles. The prime minister, who has been criticized for racking up too many air miles in his first months in office, has cited local political issues, such as tax cuts and a cost of living crisis, as his priority.\n\nThe decision not to come has sparked some controversy.\n\n\"Albanese should not be missing in action from the NATO summit,\" the Sydney Morning Herald editorialized. His \"rejection\" of the invitation was \"sacrificing geopolitics to domestic politics,\" the influential daily wrote, adding: \"This is a gathering of world leaders. ... Our leader, Albanese, should front up.\"\n\nAustralia, a strong U.S. ally since World War II in Korea, Vietnam and the global war on terror, is set to obtain nuclear submarines using American and British technology under Mr. Biden's AUKUS agreement. The opposition has attacked Mr. Albanese for \"dereliction of duty,\" but that sentiment is not universal.\n\nSome Australians say Canberra must be careful not to strain ties with Beijing, a major buyer of Australian exports.\n\n\"The prime minister's actions confirm he is part of the Asia-Pacific -- that is where our security and our economic future is and where we should invest our diplomatic and economic efforts,\" ex-Foreign Minister Bob Carr told a forum in China last week. \"Australia has no interest in seeing NATO reinvented as some tool to contain China; it is not in Australia's interest.\"\n\nChina, which fears the U.S. may be trying to forge a NATO-like alliance in the Indo-Pacific to contain its rise, has already had some sharp words about the Washington gathering and the presence of many East Asian leaders.\n\n\"NATO should adhere to its positioning as a regional defensive organization, stop creating tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, [and] stop promoting Cold War mentality and bloc confrontations,\" China's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lin Jian told reporters in a briefing Monday in Beijing.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

"body": "July 11 (UPI) -- NATO leaders have accused China of being \"a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine\" and demanded that it \"cease all material and political support\" for the Kremlin's invasion.\n\nThe comment from the 32 members of the defensive military alliance comes Wednesday in the final communique of their summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nIt states Beijing has been aiding Moscow through their so-called no limits partnership and its \"large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\"\n\nThe United States has repeatedly warned China against supporting Russia in its war effort, though it has not said Beijing has been supplying Moscow with weaponry.\n\nThe communique Wednesday also stopped short of accusing it of shipping weaponry to Russia, as North Korea has, but specifically mentioned Beijing's dual-use materials, such as weapons components, equipment and raw materials.\n\n\"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" it warned.\n\nThe People's Republic of China is China's official name.\n\nThe communique continued its criticism of China by stating it poises \"systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security\" and that the bloc is concerned over its space capabilities and activities as well as its efforts to \"rapidly expand and diversity its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems.\n\n\"We urge the PRC to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions and promote stability through transparency,\" NATO said, adding that while they are open to engagement with China \"we are boosting our shared awareness, enhancing our resilience and preparedness and protecting against the PRC's coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.\"\n\nChina maintains that it is not providing Russia with weaponry and enjoys trade relations with Moscow that have no affect any other country.\n\nBeijing's mission to the European Union on Wednesday lambasted the communique for being \"filled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric.\"\n\n\"The China-related paragraphs are provocative with obvious lies and smears,\" it said in a statement, while suggesting it's the defensive alliance that is exacerbating the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"NATO\u2002should not become the disrupter of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific or a tool used by certain power to maintain hegemony,\" it said.\n\nRelations between China and Russia have grown amid their fracturing relations with Western democracies.\n\nEarlier this month, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of an Eurasian intergovernmental security summit, their second meeting in as many months.\n\nThe NATO summit began Tuesday and is to end Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "newsobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News&Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Putin's war is fueled by those who do not share our values. Iran and North Korea provide direct military support, while China is propping up Russia's war economy. This is not just a temporary coalition of convenience, it is a major strategic shift.

In fact, Beijing supports the growing threat Moscow poses to all Euro-Atlantic security as it continues this conflict at the heart of Europe, the largest in recent history. As Stoltenberg noted, such behavior on the part of China cannot remain without it negatively impacting its interests and international reputation.\n\n\"In this dangerous world, friends and partners are more important than ever. So today we agreed to continue to strengthen our partnerships, especially in the Indo-Pacific... Tomorrow, NATO will meet with four Indo-Pacific partners and the European Union.

It was Russia's heaviest bombardment of the Ukrainian capital in almost four months, hitting seven of the city's 10 districts.\n\nThe Okhmatdyt children's hospital in central Kyiv was among several medical facilities destroyed during that attack.\n\nLocal mayor Vitaliy Klitschko told The Independent that the attack showed Russia was guilty of \"genocide\", while the United Nations refuted claims by Russia that they were not responsible for the attack.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky promised retaliation, writing on Telegram, \"The Russian terrorists must answer for this.\" He also called for Kyiv's Western allies to respond firmly.\n\nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T\u00fcrk deplored Russia's attacks, saying: \"Among the victims were Ukraine's sickest children.\"\n\nIn Russia, a fire broke out at a power substation in the Rostov region after Ukraine launched \"tens\" of drones overnight, according to Vasily Golubev, governor of the southern border region with Ukraine.\n\nThree Russian civilians were killed and several others wounded in the Belgorod border region when Ukrainian shells hit a village there, the governor said.\n\nUkraine's navy chief Vice Admiral Oleksiy Neizhpapa told the Reuters news agency that the Russian navy's Black Sea Fleet has been forced to rebase nearly all its combat-ready warships from occupied Crimea to other locations, and its main naval hub is becoming ineffectual because of attacks by Kyiv.\n\nUS says Ukraine is on an 'irreversible' path to NATO, but only after the War\n\nUkraine is on an \"irreversible\" path to NATO membership, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday, advancing American assurances that the country will be allowed to join the Western military alliance, but only after its war with Russia ends.\n\nA joint communique from all 32 NATO allies meeting in Washington cemented that \"irreversible\" NATO commitment to Ukraine, a European official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss it before its release.\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has battled for at least a firm guarantee from NATO that Ukraine can join the military alliance.\n\nNATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg underlined that Ukraine will not join the alliance's ranks immediately, but he insisted that must happen after the war is over to ensure that Russia never attacks Ukraine again.\n\nOf the overall NATO assistance, he said, \"We are not doing this because we want to prolong a war. We are doing it because we want to end a war as soon as possible.\n\nThe alliance welcomed Ukraine's democratic, economic and security reforms needed to join, and said it would get an invitation \"when allies agree and conditions are met.\"", "source": {"uri": "georgiatoday.ge", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Today on the Web"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georgia_today@georgiatoday.ge",

The European and North American members and their partners in the Indo-Pacific increasingly see shared security concerns coming from Russia and its Asian supporters, especially China.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9, Nato member countries said China has become a war enabler through its \"no-limits partnership\" with Russia and its large-scale support for Russia's defense industrial base.\n\n\"This increases the threat Russia poses to its neighbors and to Euro-Atlantic security. We call on the PRC, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with a particular responsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, to cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort,\" read the communiqu\u00e9, which referred to China by the abbreviation of its official name, the People's Republic of China.\n\n\"The PRC cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the document says.\n\nMeanwhile, a spokesperson for the Chinese mission to the European Union said the declaration of the Nato summit in Washington is full of \"belligerent rhetoric\", and the China-related content has provocations, \"lies, incitement and smears\".\n\nThe draft communique being developed at the Nato summit in Washington said that China has become a decisive enabler of Russia's war effort in Ukraine and Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Europe and to security.\n\n\"As we all know, China is not the creator of the crisis in Ukraine,\" said a spokesperson in a statement released on Thursday.\n\nAdditionally, China is staging army drills with Belarus this week at Nato's eastern border, in a sign of escalating tensions between Beijing and the US-led defence alliance.\n\nThe joint \"antiterrorist\" exercises on Russian ally Belarus's soil near the Polish border come as Nato leaders gather for a summit in Washington, with the war in nearby Ukraine high on their agenda.\n\nWith relations between Nato on the one hand and China and Russia on the other at a low ebb, analysts believe that Beijing wanted to send the alliance a warning message with the timing of the drills.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news",

To survive, it must go all in for Ukraine and declare its path to NATO membership \"irreversible\" which would remove Putin's main incentive behind prolonging the war.\n\nIt would also pit Putin directly against an unbeatable alliance. The total military budget for NATO's 32 members is 10 times' bigger than Russia's military budget, notes retired US Admiral and former NATO commander James Stavridis. \"Putin is the greatest salesman for NATO membership ever...he thinks he is Stalin but will end up like Nicholas II, the last Tsar of Russia.\"\n\nIt's a pity that France's Emmanuel Macron was not a featured keynote speaker at NATO this time. He was in Paris on the first two days sorting out an election upset which may end up weakening his power at home. He is an important advocate for the re-armament of Europe in light of the Russian threat, and has offered French troops to help Ukraine if requested.\n\nAnother aggressive leader is Poland's President Andrzej Duda who wants nations to raise their military spending commitment to 3 percent. Poland is already at 4.2 percent and moving toward 5 percent. Both should be heeded.\n\nBiden's opening speech was strong and well-received, important following his debate debacle.\n\n\"The war will end with Ukraine remaining a free and independent country\" he said and warned that Putin \"won't stop at Ukraine.\"\n\nHe pledged more air defense and attack weaponry, and NATO agreed to bankroll arms manufacturing across its membership and has bought $ 700 million worth of Stinger anti-aircraft missiles for Ukraine on behalf of several states.\n\nBritain's new Prime Minister became the latest leader to give permission to Kyiv to use its long-range missiles at targets inside Russia.\n\nPoland recently signed an iron-clad bilateral security deal with Kyiv which involves joint air defense and troop training. And NATO will establish a new military command in Germany to train and equip Ukrainian troops and place a senior representative in Kyiv to deepen Ukraine's relationship with the alliance.\n\nAll this is commendable, but the reality is that including and helping Ukraine is not optional. It's existential. The country is the best NATO member NATO never had.\n\nBut Washington and Berlin have put the brakes to its outright membership, insisting that Kyiv must win the war before it can be considered for membership. However, that delay motivates Putin to perpetuate his war of attrition in order to ensure Ukraine never receives an invitation to join NATO.\n\nAnd that's why the process must start now.\n\nThe other reason to do so is that no country deserves inclusion more than does Ukraine, given its sacrifices as well as its success in degrading Putin's armed forces. Since 2022, it's caused more than half a million Russian casualties, regained half of the territory seized after 2022, and destroyed one-third of Russia's Black Sea fleet then driven the rest from Crimea. It now attacks Russian military and oil facilities at will, and again exports its grain to the world.\n\nNATO should welcome Ukraine but should also cull and discipline existing members. A recent deal allowing Hungary to opt out of Article 5 when it comes to helping Ukraine - in return for not blocking NATO actions to fight Russia - should be reversed immediately and if Budapest objects, its government should be shown the exit.\n\nThis arrangement clearly abrogates the Organization's principle which is one-for-all-and-all-for-one.\n\nAnother important task is that NATO must clamp down on its laggards, Canada and Belgium, for not meeting their financial security spending commitments for years.\n\nWrote Politico \"Canada readily signed the 2014 pledge to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense in the wake of Vladimir Putin's seizure of Crimea in Ukraine. Two of the holdouts are Canada and Belgium, both of which are not only failing to meet the 2 percent goal but also the requirement to spend 20 percent of that on new equipment. Unlike Canada, however, Belgium says it'll get there by 2035. When will Canada? They won't say.\" NATO should invoice each nation.\n\nNATO also extended its reach by inviting close non-NATO allies to its proceedings: Ukraine, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nBut India, with the world's biggest population and armed forces, wasn't there because its Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, attended a simultaneous summit with NATO's arch-enemy Putin.\n\nWhat's interesting to note is that Russia's bombing catastrophe coincided with Modi's hug with Putin in Moscow, and was reminiscent of Putin's grandstanding love-in with China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing in 2022 just days before his invasion of Ukraine which he didn't tell Xi was going to happen.\n\nBoth leaders became willing props for Putin but are also involved by financing Moscow with oil purchases and feeding its war machine. On July 10, China was warned by NATO to stop supplying tech to Russia, but India should be warned against trading arms to Putin.\n\nBecause the Modi hug with Putin took place at the same time as innocents were being slaughtered by Putin at a children's hospital in Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelensky appropriately wrote: \"It was a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\"\n\nUkraine also deserves immediate membership in NATO in order to right wrongs. In 1990, the country pulled out of the Soviet Union, triggering the collapse of the Evil Empire. But it was orphaned. Still influenced by Soviet operatives and equipped with an army, its new government refused an invitation to join NATO.\n\nHowever in 1994 it was pressured to surrender its nuclear arsenal to the new Russian Federation and, in return, was given cash plus a security guarantee called the Budapest Memorandum.\n\nThat deal was signed by the US, UK, and Russia who each guaranteed to prevent Ukraine's borders from ever being breached. None lived up to their promises and after 1994 Moscow began land grabs in Georgia, Moldova, Syria, and Ukraine.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Europe also slept. France's Emmanuel Macron decried its de-militarization and called NATO \"brain dead.\" Germany barreled ahead building pipelines with Russia, which were obviously intended to hold the continent captive to Russian energy.\n\nNow there is a terrible war in Europe and no excuse for hesitancy to fully help or reward Ukrainians for defending Europe's Eastern flank from being overrun by Kremlin cannon fodder.\n\nThe only solution is that NATO can and must defeat Russia. Its signs of weakness have been pounced on by Russia and extended the conflict. This year there are concerns about a Trump presidency gutting America's contributions to the cause.\n\nTo counteract these obstacles, actions to Trump-proof NATO must be expedited such as more aggressive financial commitments and the deployment of more troops into Eastern Europe, especially the Baltics who worry that Putin's next step is to invade them this year.\n\nAll three of these tiny countries are fortifying their borders, bolstering their security systems, raising civilian armies, and allowing guns in homes. For those who think this is preposterous, just ask yourself how secure would you feel if you bordered Russia and NATO pulled its punches, kowtowed to Hungary, and allowed members to shortchange their commitments?\n\nYoung dialysis patient at Kyiv bombing incident\n\nNATO must and can provide Ukraine with everything it needs to expel Russia. This is 1948 all over again and the alliance must rescue Europe's largest and most valiant country, or all of Europe and others will be at risk.\n\nReprinted from [email protected] - Diane Francis on

"The United States will start deploying longer range missiles in Germany in 2026, the two countries announced at a meeting of the NATO alliance, a major step aimed at countering what the allies say is a growing threat Russia poses to Europe.\n\nThe decision will send Germany the most potent US weapons to be based on the European continent since the Cold War, in a clear warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA US-German statement said the \"episodic deployments\" were in preparation for longer-term stationing in Europe of capabilities that would include SM-6, Tomahawk and developmental hypersonic weapons with greater range.\n\nThe move would have been banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by the US and the Soviet Union in 1987 but that collapsed in 2019.\n\n\"We cannot discount the possibility of an attack against Allies' sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" the allies said in a communique released on Wednesday.\n\nMore aid was headed to Ukraine as the allies bolster Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nA communique said the allies intend to provide Ukraine with at least 40 billion euros ($43.28 billion) in military aid within the next year, but stopped short of the multi-year commitment NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had sought.\n\nThe document also strengthened past NATO language on China, calling it a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war effort in Ukraine and saying Beijing continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security.\n\nStoltenberg told reporters it was the first time the 32 allies had jointly labelled China a decisive enabler of Russia's war and called it an important message.\n\nHe said NATO was not an organisation that imposes sanctions, but added, \"At the end of the day, this will be for individual allies to make decisions, but I think the message we send from NATO from this summit is very clear.\"\n\nThe communique called on China to cease material and political support for Russia's war effort and expressed concern about China's space capabilities, referenced rapid expansion of its nuclear arsenal, and urged Beijing to engage in strategic risk reduction talks.",

Those delays highlighted Ukraine's vulnerability in trying to repel invading Russian forces.\n\nStoltenberg said the security assistance center will be located in Wiesbaden, Germany, and will be led by a three-star general overseeing around 700 personnel from across the alliance. They will be responsible for the coordination and provision of most of the international security assistance that is sent, he said.\n\nNATO countries until now have coordinated support to Ukraine through an informal, U.S.-led body called the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.\n\nThe new center, which was approved by NATO defense ministers in June, will be formally known as the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) and will be part of Ukraine's \"irreversible path\" to NATO membership.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it will be the first time NATO has dedicated a command to helping a country join NATO.\n\nThe operation in Poland will be known as a joint training and analysis center (JTAC), which will focus on improving NATO interoperability with Ukraine and studying the way the Ukraine war has changed warfare.\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said the JTAC, which will be built in his hometown of Bydgoszcz, will examine the use of drones and other modern aspects of the Ukrainian war, which he said are causing NATO to reevaluate its assumptions.\n\n\"The role of drones has been transformational in this war, and we need to study it and learn [from] the lessons,\" Sikorski said, speaking at a panel discussion on the sidelines of the summit. He envisions it becoming a state-of-the-art war analysis center that examines how drone warfare is changing the battlefield. And he predicted that Ukrainians eventually will take on major roles at the JTAC.\n\n\"In the future it won't be us training the Ukrainians, the Ukrainians will be teaching us. And I hope JTAC will serve that,\" he said.\n\nStoltenberg said NATO's plans to establish these two support facilities are within the elements of the \"robust\" security support package agreed during the summit along with providing Ukraine with 40 billion euros ($43 billion) in military aid for next year, bilateral agreements, and more equipment, including air-defense systems.\n\nHe said the decisions were \"major\" and would further strengthen NATO's support for Kyiv and help Ukraine uphold its right to self-defense but would not make NATO a party to the conflict.\n\n\"We are not doing this because we want to prolong the war. We are doing this because we want to end the war as soon as possible,\" Stoltenberg said.\n\nStoltenberg said that it's important for NATO to show commitment and resolve at this point in the war.\n\n\"The more credible and enduring our support the quicker Moscow will realize it cannot wait us out and the sooner the war can end,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType":

But Australia and other non-member partners from the Asia-Pacific region are in attendance to strengthen ties with the alliance amid fears about Chinese aggression.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles, who visited Ukraine in April, is set to announce the new support for the country at the summit on Thursday, local time.\n\nHe is also expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the event, along with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Japan, and the president of South Korea.\n\nRussia's attacks on Ukraine in recent days have included the bombing of the main children's hospital in Kyiv, which killed dozens of people.\n\nNATO allies have agreed to provide Ukraine with military support of at least 40 billion euros ($64 billion) over the next year, according to a 38-point summit declaration released on Wednesday, local time.\n\nThe Australian military package includes guided and air defence missiles, anti-tank weapons, ammunition, and a shipment of boots. It brings the value of Australia's overall support to $1.3 billion, including $1.1 billion for Ukraine's military, the government says.\n\nThe Australian Defence Force has already been training Ukrainian army recruits under Operation Kudu in the UK. It will now also sign on as an \"operational partner\" to the new NATO command, and a group of Australian personnel who are already stationed in Europe will transfer across to the initiative.\n\nWashington has proven to be an apt backdrop for this year's NATO summit. US President Joe Biden's moves are being heavily scrutinised as domestic debate about his candidacy for the presidency intensifies, including among members of his own party.\n\nBut many NATO members are concerned about the possible re-election of Donald Trump, who has indicated he could scale back, or even cut off, American support for both Ukraine and NATO.\n\nTrump this week said he would not pull the US out of the alliance, but he wanted members to meet their defence spending obligations.\n\n\"I just want them to pay their bills,\" Trump told Fox News Radio. \"We're protecting Europe. They take advantage of us very badly.\"\n\nThis year, 23 of NATO's 32 member states are expected to hit the defence spending target of 2 per cent of GDP.

That same year, NATO identified China as a potential threat for the first time, saying Beijing posed systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security.\n\nAnalysts said both groupings are bonded over similar concerns stemming from China's growing assertiveness in the region and its strategic direction.\n\nProfessor Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi said NATO's interest in the region reflects the inter-regional links between the European continent, North America and the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"The Indo-Pacific is economically vital, not only for NATO, but the world. There's much at stake for (all) sides,\" said the senior fellow at the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at American think tank the Atlantic Council.\n\nHowever, he added that cooperation is in the early stages and would likely be limited to information sharing, exchanging of perspectives, as well as occasional exercises in maritime, cyber and information security.\n\nNATO believes ongoing dialogue can help enhance the mutual situational awareness of security developments in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nWhile NATO has stepped up cooperation with Indo-Pacific partners in the past few years, observers said the bloc's expansion is not new nor recent.\n\nThe alliance was founded by 12 countries in 1949. Through 10 rounds of accession, it has grown to 32 nations today.\n\nAssociate Professor Reuben Wong pointed to the gradual shift of NATO's objectives. It was set up 75 years ago for the defence of Western Europe. Its focus then shifted to the defence of most of Europe, and is now creeping into the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"While this is good for European security, the expansion also comes with some costs,\" said the deputy head of the National University of Singapore's political science department.\n\n\"When you expand a military alliance with no clear military threat, it makes other countries suspicious,\" he added.\n\nOne such suspicious nation, which has repeatedly voiced and acted on its opposition to NATO's expansion, is Russia.\n\n\"Russia feels that it is being encircled by former Eastern Bloc countries that used to be allies of Moscow, but now they're part of the Western United States-led bloc. That led to a lot of insecurity,\" said Wong.\n\nAs more nations - including Ukraine and Georgia - apply to join NATO, Associate Professor Marianne Hanson said that continued expansion is not the answer.\n\n\"It is not going to ease Russia's fears of NATO coming ever closer to its borders. This is something NATO states have to tread very carefully on,\" said the associate professor from the University of Queensland's School of Political Science and International Studies.\n\nShe said a better alternative would have been a system that included Russia within the folds of European security from the start.\n\n\"There are different options. Pushing NATO repeatedly fails to understand the security fears that are very real in Moscow,\" said Hanson.\n\nHowever, William Courtney, an adjunct senior fellow at American think tank RAND Corporation, said that circumstances have changed for NATO over the years.\n\nUp until Russia's 2022 full scale invasion of Ukraine, NATO has been relatively \"modest\" in its response to Moscow's aggression on countries that were moving closer to the European Union, he said.\n\nHe pointed to Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008 and Russia's annexation of Crimea in Ukraine's south in 2014. Both conflicts were not met by strong rebuke from the alliance.\n\n\"But now, we see full-on sanctions and military assistance on a much larger scale,\" said Courtney, who is also a former US ambassador to Georgia and Kazakhstan.\n\n\"Europe sees Russia as a country that may - if it prevails in Ukraine - attack another European country.\"\n\nWong warned that the same reasons fuelling Russia's insecurity could repeat in the Indo-Pacific region, adding NATO and IP4 should manage their partnerships carefully.\n\n\"NATO has to be careful in how it defines its mission. Some statements might not be very good in making sure that other countries in the Asia-Pacific feel secure with NATO's expansion and its expanded mandate,\" said Wong.", "source": {"uri":

Earlier this week, Beijing started joint military exercises with Russia's close ally Belarus at a training ground mere miles away from the Polish border, the Belarusian Defense Ministry said in a Google-translated Telegram post.\n\nOn the February 2023 first-year anniversary of the Ukraine war, China -- which a month later successfully capitalized on goodwill earned as a trade partner to broker a reconciliation between arch-enemies Iran and Saudi Arabia -- pitched a peace framework for the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv. It, like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's peace plan and Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin's own recent conditions to ignite diplomatic negotiations, has so far failed to gain traction.\n\nAfter years of a velvet-gloved diplomacy and viewing China as a distant concern, NATO on Wednesday said Beijing \"continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security,\" underscoring the alleged disinformation stemming from the world's second-largest economy and its activities in space and cyberspace.\n\n\"The PRC continues to rapidly expand and diversify its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems. We urge the PRC to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions and promote stability through transparency,\" the NATO communique said, warning that allies are simultaneously raising their \"shared awareness\" and enhancing preparations to protect against China's \"coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.\"\n\nCNBC has reached out to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a scathing riposte, China's mission to the European Union said that the NATO statement \"hypes up China-Russia relations undercutting and reshaping the rules-based international order\" and is \"filled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric.\"\n\nIt added, \"The China-related paragraphs are provocative with obvious lies and smears. We firmly reject and deplore these accusations and have lodged serious representations with NATO.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors":

At a summit two years ago, allies decided to modernise their defence and deterrence. But the alliance is now facing fresh challenges.\n\n\"Right now, Russia is on a wartime footing with regard to defence production. They are significantly ramping up their production of weapons, munitions, and vehicles. And they're doing it with the help of China, North Korea and Iran,\" he said, adding \"We cannot in my view, we cannot allow the (NATO) alliance to fall behind.\"\n\nTo that end, he noted, that every member has taken a pledge to put together plans to shore up defence production at home. \"That means as an alliance (we) will become more innovative and competitive. We're able to produce more critical defence equipment more quickly than we should so that we may need it,\" Biden asserted.\n\nKyiv has not been offered a formal invitation to join the alliance, as there is no consensus among allies for such an endeavour.\n\nNATO's reassuring language that Ukraine's path to membership of the alliance is \"irreversible\" represents a step forward, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Stefanishyna said.\n\nIt's a \"very strong message on membership,\" she told Euronews.\n\nMoreover, it's a clear signal to Russia about Ukraine's future, she said.\n\nSeveral experts say membership is the only guarantee of Ukrainian security, particularly because the majority of Ukrainian territory would be covered by Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which ensures that an attack on one ally is responded to as if it were an attack on all allies.\n\n\"It's not enough to say that NATO's future is in NATO,\" says former US ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder.\n\n\"Russia will not give up its goal of controlling Ukraine unless and until Ukraine is integrated in the Western institutions - NATO and the European Union,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a wasted opportunity not to offer membership to Ukraine,\" said Ed Arnold, Senior Research Fellow for European Security at the Royal United Service Institute (RUSI).\n\n\"We don't have time; anyone can reverse the course of Ukraine's path because the language at this summit is not legally binding,\" he said.\n\n\"Trump can reverse it if he comes to power. And we know how Trump dislikes other people's deals, not to mention the fact that Trump has a bad history with Zelenskyy.\"\n\nAs US president, Donald Trump attempted to blackmail Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by withholding US military support for Ukraine unless he created a bogus investigation into corruption by Hunter Biden - the son of Joe Biden. The matter led to Trump's impeachment after whistleblowers revealed the affair.\n\nZelenskyy and his team, including Deputy PM Stefanishyna, are in Washington for the 75th anniversary of NATO.\n\nNATO allies significantly stepped up their contributions to Ukraine as part of this week's summit, including dozens of defence systems and a timeline for the delivery of F-16 fighter jets.\n\n\"All of the announcements on air defences and Patriot systems are important, but they won't move the dial for Ukrainian security -- not like NATO membership would,\" said Arnold.\n\nPart of the concern among some countries in hesitating to support Ukrainian membership is the clear liability and risk that would emerge for allies in admitting a country in the middle of an intense armed conflict.\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the NATO Summit in Washington.\n\nHowever, Ambassador Daalder says that only the undisputed parts of Ukraine would be covered under Article 5 guarantees.\n\nOccupied areas such as Crimea, the Donbas and parts of Ukraine's east would not be covered. But Kyiv and the rest would be, which would, in theory, go some way in deterring Russia from attacks such as the one this week on the hospitals, including one children's hospital.", "source": {"uri":

Now it is too late.\n\nAll the discussions at NATO's 75th anniversary in Washington, DC, were laden with promises of future conflict with Russia. As President Joe Biden revealed, NATO is actively preparing for war.\n\nCurrently, it is peacetime, at least for the 32 members. However, behind closed doors, there is a recognition that Ukraine is being used as a testing ground for future warfare with Russia.\n\nNATO members have supplied Ukraine with a mix of outdated and cutting-edge weapons for Ukrainian troops to experiment with on the battlefield.\n\nSince February 2022, it has become evident that Russia is engaged in a prolonged conflict with Ukraine, which is heavily dependent on the support of the US and its allies.\n\nGiven the uncertainty associated with the upcoming electoral round in the US, Biden is currently offering unwavering support to Ukraine and its allies. But after November, anything can happen.\n\nNATO is now at the forefront of the West's strategic planning for a future war with Russia. In Washington, the US, as the principal sponsor of the ongoing conflict, continues to supply Ukraine with the necessary resources to combat Russian forces.\n\nAs the conflict evolves, the specter of nuclear Armageddon looms ever closer.\n\nIndeed, NATO should use its 75th commemoration to promote unity and success as a stepping stone towards building future peace for the next generation.\n\nInstead, the world's largest military alliance has arrogantly pledged to increase funding, innovation, and other capabilities that would make future wars even more lethal and destructive for humans and their environments.\n\nThis focus on militarization overshadowed the potential for diplomatic solutions and peaceful initiatives.\n\nThe gathering in Washington, DC, was a missed opportunity because Ukraine was the main focus of the commemoration.\n\nThe harsh reality is that Kyiv aims to win the war against Russia, which has invaded its eastern neighbor in violation of international law.\n\nHowever, many experts and scholars worldwide reiterate that Western support for Ukraine will not last indefinitely.\n\nThere must be a compromise solution that can save lives and lessen global tensions. Most importantly, it would help reduce the chance of nuclear conflict.\n\nRussia is preparing for nuclear war because, if the situation continues as it is, it has nothing to lose.\n\nThe best strategy for Russia might be to inflict unfathomable damage on NATO members, particularly those who are strong supporters of Ukraine, including the allies on the Atlantic side.\n\nDespite his autocratic tendencies, President Putin is still capable of negotiating. He was willing to consider business propositions.\n\nConversely, it is interesting that the Western alliance currently does not want to accept this proposition.\n\nThey believe they can win. Furthermore, they also believe that continuous warfare will greatly weaken Russia's economic and military strength in the long term.\n\nThe potential destruction of the whole of Europe is a real risk, given that Russia is an integral part of the continent.\n\nThis would be a lose-lose scenario. NATO still has time to change this destructive pathway.\n\nNATO political leaders must come to their common senses and realize that it would be better to live cooperatively and competitively with Russia than confrontationally as before.\n\nThe 75th anniversary of NATO could have been a platform to envision a future of peace and cooperation.\n\nInstead, it has solidified the alliance's preparation for conflict. This approach risks not only prolonging the war in Ukraine but also escalating it into a broader and more devastating confrontation.\n\nThe path forward should focus on dialogue, compromise, and the pursuit of mutual understanding to prevent the catastrophic consequences of a nuclear conflict.\n\nFortunately, the regional countries are all for these peaceful approaches.\n\nNATO's Washington rendezvous should have been a moment to reflect on past successes and chart a course toward a peaceful and cooperative future.\n\nInstead, the alliance has doubled down on its militaristic approach, preparing for a war that could have devastating global repercussions.\n\nDeep down, they also want their Indo-Pacific friends and allies to join in, broadening the potential for more conflicts.\n\nTherefore, NATO leaders must shift their focus from confrontation to collaboration, to prevent the loss of countless lives and the potential destruction of Europe.\n\nBy embracing diplomacy and seeking peaceful resolutions, NATO can honor its original mission of ensuring the security and stability of its member states.\n\nThe time to act is now before the world is plunged into another devastating conflict.", "source": {"uri": "thaipbsworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thaipbsworld.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Georgian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member states of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Militarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://files.world.thaipbs.or.th/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-11-161952.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717162", "eventUri": "eng-9717162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

It was the first time in 29 years, as South Korea's Yonhap News reported, that a South Korean president had visited the headquarters, renamed the Indo-Pacific command six years ago.\n\nMr. Yoon focused on North Korea, proclaiming \"a steadfast combined defense readiness is more critical than ever\" while North Korea's \"evolving nuclear and missile capabilities and continued provocations are threatening the Korean peninsula and the region.\"\n\nBeside Mr. Yooon as he spoke were Admiral Samuiel Paparo, commander of the Indo-Pacific command, and General Paul LaCamera, commander of America's 28,500 troops in Korea.\n\nAlthough China was not mentioned, the Chinese left no doubt of the link between NATO and the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"NATO has invited Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, and Australia for three consecutive years and attempted to form an 'Asia-Pacific NATO,'\" said the Global Times. \"This organization, which originally claimed to be 'defensive,' is now trying to prove it can 'protect' the whole 'Asia-Pacific' region.\"\n\nIndo-Pacific leaders were not expected to criticize China directly while offering qualified support for President Zelensky in Ukraine's war against Russia.\n\nThe qualification is how much military aid each is expected to be willing to provide Ukraine while not officially bonding with NATO nations in Ukraine's defense.\n\nSouth Korea, for instance, is shipping artillery shells to replenish diminished American stocks while America in turn ships shells to Ukraine.\n\nAll the Indo-Pacific countries were sure to endorse whatever statement emerged from the confab even as underlings sought to paper over the reality that a Republican administration under President Trump, who has been critical of NATO, may take over in January.\n\nThe Indo-Pacific grouping -- not quite an alliance -- has tightened in recent years with the emergence of a grouping that includes Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Emissaries of the group, which goes by the acronym Aukus, were expected to meet separately from NATO, confirming their tight relationship.\n\nAlliance partners, however, were disappointed that India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, chose to meet President Putin at Moscow just as NATO leaders were gathering at Washington.\n\nThe meeting was seen as undermining the significance of another grouping, Quad Four, the quadrilateral dialogue including Australia, America, and Japan as well as India.\n\nThe Hindustan Times quoted a Pentagon spokesman as saying Washington would \"continue to view India as a strategic partner\" and trusts India would encourage an \"enduring and just peace for Ukraine.\"\n\nMore practically, Mr. Modi thanked Mr. Putin for the oil and natural gas that India imports from Russia along with military aid, including fighter planes.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "donald_kirk@nysun.com", "name":

Earlier this week, Beijing started joint military exercises with Russia's close ally Belarus at a training ground mere miles away from the Polish border, the Belarusian Defense Ministry said in a Google-translated Telegram post.\n\nOn the February 2023 first-year anniversary of the Ukraine war, China -- which a month later successfully capitalized on goodwill earned as a trade partner to broker a reconciliation between arch-enemies Iran and Saudi Arabia -- pitched a peace framework for the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv. It, like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's peace plan and Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin's own recent conditions to ignite diplomatic negotiations, has so far failed to gain traction.\n\nAfter years of a velvet-gloved diplomacy and viewing China as a distant concern, NATO on Wednesday said Beijing \"continues to pose systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security,\" underscoring the alleged disinformation stemming from the world's second-largest economy and its activities in space and cyberspace.\n\n\"The PRC continues to rapidly expand and diversify its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems. We urge the PRC to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions and promote stability through transparency,\" the NATO communique said, warning that allies are simultaneously raising their \"shared awareness\" and enhancing preparations to protect against China's \"coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.\"\n\nCNBC has reached out to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a scathing riposte, China's mission to the European Union said that the NATO statement \"hypes up China-Russia relations undercutting and reshaping the rules-based international order\" and is \"filled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric.\"\n\nIt added, \"The China-related paragraphs are provocative with obvious lies and smears. We firmly reject and deplore these accusations and have lodged serious representations with NATO.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors":

The draft details China's supply of dual-use materials such as weapons components, equipment and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia's defense sector.\n\nThe U.S. briefed NATO allies on China's support in the run-up to the summit as part of efforts to cement shared concern over the burgeoning defense partnership, the people said. The draft document says that China poses \"systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security,\" including through cyber activities and disinformation as well as its development of counter-space capabilities.\n\nThe wording of the draft could change before the final version is released Thursday.\n\n\"Our normal trade with Russia is done aboveboard,\" Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in an emailed statement. \"China does not provide weapons to the parties to the conflict and strictly controls the export of dual-use articles.\"\n\nSwedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson said \"it would be very unwise\" for China to deliver weapons to Russia.\n\nAllies have pointed out \"that China and Russia are collaborating deeply in the defense field,\" including with more joint military exercises and Beijing providing a lot of dual-use equipment, Jonson said in an interview. \"They've been increasing that support and that's a great concern.\"\n\nU.S. officials have said China is holding off directly providing weapons and artillery, something that would signal an unprecedented escalation and almost certainly trigger more forceful action - such as sanctions - against the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nStill, European capitals were alarmed by reports this month that Chinese and Russian companies are developing an attack drone similar to an Iranian model deployed in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported earlier.\n\nThe push from NATO shows a growing consensus between the U.S. and its partners that Beijing represents a threat not just in Asia, but also to European security through its support for Russia. In recent years, European capitals from Berlin to London, Prague and Vilnius have hardened their stance on China.\n\nBloomberg also reported in April that Beijing was providing Russia with satellite imagery for military purposes, microelectronics and machine tools for tanks, as well as a swath of technologies used in weapons or needed to produce them.\n\nBack in May, former U.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps provoked a tiff with Washington when he suggested that China was working to provide Russia with lethal aid. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that to date, the U.S. hadn't seen China providing weapons directly to Russia.\n\n_____\n\n(With assistance from Milda Seputyte and Andrea

Reuters-Yonhap\n\n\"Anything\" that South Korea can provide to help strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities will be \"warmly welcomed,\" a senior NATO official said Tuesday, stressing the \"strategic\" implications of Russia's war in Ukraine for both Europe and Asia.\n\nThe official made the remarks as Seoul has said it would reconsider its policy ban on the provision of lethal weapons to Ukraine following last month's summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang.\n\nAt the summit, the two sides signed a \"comprehensive strategic partnership\" treaty, which has further deepened concerns about their growing military alignment and its implications for security.\n\n\"As far as South Korea providing weapons to Ukraine, I think that ultimately, we all have an interest in ensuring that Russia does not achieve a victory here, and I think that the outcome of this conflict has strategic implications in Europe, and it has strategic implications in Asia,\" the official said in a press briefing.\n\n\"I think that anything that South Korea can do -- that improves Ukraine's ability to defend itself against an illegal invasion from Vladimir Putin -- is something that would be warmly welcomed,\" he added.\n\nThe briefing took place as the leaders of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies are set to attend a summit in Washington this week. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and the leaders of three other Indo-Pacific countries -- Japan, Australia and New Zealand -- have been invited to the summit.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, right, shakes hands with South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol prior to a meeting during a NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, July 11, 2023. AP-Yonhap\n\nAsked to comment on the future of arms transactions between Moscow and Pyongyang, the official noted that \"the biggest thing\" that Russia needs from the North at this point are artillery munitions and ballistic missiles.\n\n\"Those are the two things that they are getting from North Korea now and certainly making use of on the battlefield,\" he said. \"We've seen North Korean missiles being used and, and we see them having an impact there.\"\n\nWashington has revealed that the North provided Russia with more than 11,000 containers of munitions and related material and dozens of ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine.\n\nIn return, the North has been seeking assistance from Moscow, including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles and ballistic missile production equipment, according to U.S. officials.\n\nIn a separate briefing, another senior NATO official pointed out that NATO and its Indo-Pacific partners are facing a \"very similar\" set of issues that have created momentum for their cooperation.\n\n\"They face, in many ways, a quite similar set of issues. They face at least one big authoritarian country which is testing the international rules-based order, which is using military coercion to try and achieve political goals,\" the official said.\n\n\"They face similar issues in terms of rebuilding military capabilities so that they are themselves able to ensure deterrence and defense. They have to also think about the changing nuclear picture with both North Korea and China and they're dealing with hybrid threats,\" he added.\n\nThe official also said that South Korea has become an \"important industrial partner\" for many NATO allies.\n\n\"It's not some, per se, about NATO getting involved in the Indo-Pacific directly, but it's about facing a very similar set of issues learning from each other and supporting each other,\" he said.\n\nThe leaders of NATO's Indo-Pacific partners are set to participate in talks on Thursday to discuss a range of issues, including resilience, efforts to counter disinformation, technological cooperation and cybersecurity, a U.S. official has said.

Beijing presents itself as a neutral party in the war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nIt has, however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began. But that economic partnership has come under close scrutiny from the west in recent months, with Washington vowing to go after financial institutions that facilitate Moscow's war effort.\n\nThe United States and Europe have also accused Beijing of selling components and equipment necessary to keep Moscow's military production afloat. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in April that this included \"machine tools, semiconductors and other dual use items that have helped Russia rebuild the defence industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade.\"\n\nBeijing has denied claims it is aiding Russia's fighting in Ukraine and insisted it won't accept \"criticism or pressure\" over its ties with Moscow.\n\nAnd on Thursday, its foreign ministry accused the alliance of \"prejudice, smearing and provocation\".\n\n\"Nato's rhetoric about China's responsibility in Ukraine is unjustified and malicious,\" spokesman Lin Jian said.\n\n\"We urge Nato to reflect on the root causes of the crisis and its own actions, listen carefully to the just voice of the international community, and take concrete actions to ease the situation instead of shifting the blame to others.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors":

Since taking office, President Biden has worked to strengthen the critical ties between our NATO Allies and NATO partners in the Indo-Pacific. This is the third consecutive NATO summit where Indo-Pacific Partners join NATO Allies at the highest levels.\n\nAs Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine has demonstrated, the threats and challenges we face are interconnected. Developments in one region directly affect security and economic stability in other regions. For instance, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has provided ballistic missiles and munitions to Russia for use against Ukraine, in clear violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions. At the same time, during Putin's recent visit to Pyongyang, Russia and the DPRK committed to increasing their military and economic cooperation. Russia continues to supply the DPRK with refined petroleum beyond what is permitted by U.N. Security Council resolutions and blocked the renewal of a U.N. sanctions monitoring panel, each of which undermine peace and security in the Indo-Pacific. The People's Republic of China (PRC)'s ongoing support for Russia's defense industrial base also enables Russia to reconstitute its war machine and maintain its illegal war against Ukraine.\n\nIn response to Russia's war against Ukraine, the United States has built a global coalition of countries around the world - including the IPP - that have stepped up to make historic contributions to support Ukraine as it defends its freedom and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity enshrined in the UN Charter. The IPP countries have also added their voices to the chorus of countries working with Ukraine to secure a just and lasting peace because they recognize how much is at stake.\n\nBeyond these issues, IPP countries also provide critical expertise and experience as NATO works to address transnational challenges. At the NATO Summit this year, NATO and the IPP are enhancing practical cooperation through new flagship projects in the areas of support to Ukraine, cyber defense, countering hostile information including disinformation, and technology. NATO Allies and IPP countries are also engaging in regular discussion about the growing relationship between Russia and the DPRK.\n\nNATO's partnerships across the globe, including its relationships with the IPP, are crucial to addressing shared and interconnected challenges, as they allow NATO and its partners to share expertise and information about global issues that affect our collective security and stability. In the context of an interconnected threat environment, which features a deepening Russia-DPRK military partnership and PRC support for Russia's defense industrial base, NATO benefits from exchanging expertise and experiences with partners in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nBy supporting Ukraine, increasing defense spending, and through the development of individual NATO partnerships with IPP countries, Indo-Pacific Partners are strongly investing in global security.\n\nThe Australian Government has been a vital contributor to Euro-Atlantic security through provision of military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. The Australian Government has committed over AUD 1.1 billion to Ukraine since March 2022, including AUD 880 million in military and AUD 85 million in humanitarian assistance. This includes ongoing contributions by the Australian Defence Force to multinational efforts to train Ukrainian personnel in the United Kingdom and support of partners' efforts in Europe via embedded personnel. Australia has also helped protect a vital gateway for international assistance to Ukraine through its six-month deployment of an E-7A Wedgetail airborne early warning aircraft that concluded in April 2024. Additionally, the Government has imposed a suite of measures against Russia, including over 1,200 targeted sanctions. Australia has been steadfast in supporting Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, upholding the UN Charter, international law, and the rules-based order.\n\nJapan\n\nJapan has been a prominent supporter of Ukraine ever since the outbreak of aggression. Japan's contribution in the G7, shown especially in the G7 Hiroshima Summit last year, has also been significant. In February, Japan conducted the Japan-Ukraine Conference for Promotion of Economic Growth and Reconstruction. In June, Japan signed the Accord on Support for Ukraine and Cooperation between the government of Japan and Ukraine as the first non-Atlantic country to sign such a document. Since March 2022, Japan has committed to provide Ukraine with financial, humanitarian, and other assistance worth a total value of over $12 billion, including $4.5 billion support for 2024.\n\nFurther, since May 2023, Japan has delivered 101 vehicles to Ukraine, in addition to provisions of emergency rations, helmets, protective clothing, and other equipment. Japan announced $67 million to the NATO Comprehensive Assistance Package for Ukraine that will provide counter-unmanned aircraft detection systems and other gear. In light of Ukraine's urgent need for additional energy infrastructure, Japan has also provided two large autotransformers, five gas turbine generators, and transportation support for seven autotransformers.\n\nIn the area of humanitarian mine action, Japan has been a prominent donor and co-chair of the Sectoral Working Group on Humanitarian Demining in Ukraine. Japan is also in the process of providing large Japanese-made demining machines, which will begin delivery in July 2024. Japan will also host an international conference on Ukraine mine action next year.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nIn February, New Zealand announced an additional $15.8 million package of support for Ukraine. This included an extension of New Zealand Defense Forces (NZDF) deployment to the United Kingdom and across Europe until June 2025. NZDF personnel continue to train Ukrainian soldiers, and provide intelligence, liaison, and logistics support. Additionally, New Zealand has imposed sanctions on more than 1,700 individuals and entities since the Russia Sanctions Act entered into force in March 2022. New Zealand announced new funding for medical rehabilitation and drones on July 10, 2024, as well as new humanitarian assistance. New Zealand's total $79.5 million in pledged support to date includes $50.8 million in military assistance, $19.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukrainian communities in Ukraine and neighboring countries; and $3.19 million for international legal processes and human rights monitoring.\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nThe ROK provided $100 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine in 2022 and has pledged $150 million in short-term aid in 2023; $300 million in short-term aid for 2024; and $2 billion in long-term, low-interest loans via the Economic Development Cooperation Fund beginning in 2025. The ROK also pledged to donate 200 total 450kW generators to support Ukraine's energy sector. In June, the ROK contributed $12 million to the NATO Comprehensive Assistance Package for Ukraine that will support the Military Medical Clinical Treatment Rehabilitation Centre Project.\n\nDefense Spending\n\nAs NATO Allies are working aggressively towards their 2 percent defense spending targets, IPP partners are investing in their own defense, and in doing so strengthening deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. This includes Australia's recent decision to increase defense spending to 2.3 percent of GDP by 2033, Japan's 17 percent increase in defense spending in fiscal year 2024 and its fiscal year 2027 target of increasing the budget for its defense capabilities and complementary initiatives to 2 percent of GDP, and the Republic of Korea's 4.2 percent increase in defense spending over the prior year.\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralia continues to ensure its national security and defense requirements are resourced to align with the quickly evolving international security and threat landscape. Aside from current spending of approximately 2 percent of GDP on defense, the Australian government recently announced a significant increase in defense spending to 2.3 percent of GDP by 2033. Australia has allocated AUD 765 billion to defense spending over the next decade.\n\nJapan\n\nJapan's 7.72 trillion JPY overall defense budget for fiscal year 2024 contained a 17 percent increase over the previous year. Japan remains on course to meet the government's target of increasing the budget for its defense capabilities and complementary initiatives to two percent of its 2022 GDP by Japan's fiscal year 2027.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNew Zealand is currently developing its Defense Capability Plan, which will signal the Government's capability intentions for Defense until 2040. In the interim, in May 2024, Defense Minister Judith Collins KC announced $344 million of new funding over four years, including $98 million for personnel remuneration and $245 million for upgrading equipment and infrastructure. This will fund the beginning of the Army's Unimog and Pinzgauer truck replacement project, the next phase of NH90 helicopter navigation systems and radio upgrades, a Linton Military Camp supply facilities and logistics upgrade, and other upgrades. The truck replacement would enhance interoperability with regional and global partners.\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nThe ROK's 2024 defense budget totaled $44.45 billion and marked a 4.2 percent increase from the year before (outpacing the national budget increase of 2.8 percent). The ROK maintains a stable ratio around 2.5% in defense spending against GDP. The ROK's defense budget places an emphasis on Defense Innovation 4.0 goals, with a 4.4 percent boost to Force Improvement Programs (FIP). The budget also plans to revitalize the Three-Axis System to counter DPRK WMD and ballistic missile threats, build a robust manned-unmanned composite system based on artificial intelligence, and improve service conditions for junior-grade and non-commissioned officers.\n\nNATO and Australia have been engaged in dialogue and cooperation since 2005, and Australia has been a leading contributor to NATO missions around the world for two decades.\n\nIn a joint political declaration in June 2012, NATO and Australia signaled their commitment to strengthening cooperation. Since formalizing cooperation through a NATO-Australia Individual Partnership and Cooperation Program in 2013, this cooperation has undertaken different iterations. Approved in July 2023, the NATO-Australia relationship is now guided by the NATO-Australia Individually Tailored Partnership Programme for 2023-26.\n\nPriorities in NATO-Australia relations include upholding agreed norms, rules and standards; promoting mutual understanding of global security issues; enhancing interoperability between NATO and Australia; and engaging on issues of common interest, including cyber defense, hybrid threats, Women Peace and Security, space, and science and technology. Australia also participates in NATO Mission Iraq and Operation Sea Guardian as an operational partner.\n\nJapan\n\nNATO and Japan have been engaged in dialogue and cooperation since initial contacts in the early 1990s.\n\nNATO and Japan signaled their commitment to strengthening cooperation in a joint political declaration signed in April 2013. From 2014, work was taken forward through a NATO-Japan Individual Partnership and Cooperation Program. That cooperation is now guided by an ITPP that NATO and Japan approved in July 2023.\n\nPractical cooperation is being developed in a wide range of areas, including cyber defense, strategic communication, maritime security, emergency management and disaster relief, non-proliferation, science and technology, Women, Peace and Security and human security.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNew Zealand has a more than 25-year history of cooperation with NATO, including contributing to NATO operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Afghanistan. Since 2012, work has been taken forward through an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Program. In 2024, New Zealand and NATO concluded an Individually Tailored Partnership Program, which now serves as the basis for bilateral cooperation.\n\nNATO and New Zealand cooperate in areas of common interest, including science and technology; cyber defense; and climate change and security.\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nNATO and the Republic of Korea have been engaged in dialogue and cooperation since 2005.\n\nIn 2012, cooperation between NATO and the Republic of Korea was initially taken forward through an Individual Partnership and Cooperation Program. Currently, the cooperation is guided by an Individually Tailored Partnership Program that NATO and the Republic of Korea agreed in July 2023.\n\nIn November 2022, the Republic of Korea established a Diplomatic Mission to NATO, enhancing opportunities for political dialogue with the Alliance. The Republic of Korea is also a champion of Women, Peace, and Security -- a shared priority with NATO Allies and partners.\n\nPolitical dialogue and practical cooperation are being developed across priority areas, including non-proliferation, cyber defense, science and technology, counterterrorism, interoperability, and defense against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN)

-\n\nThe most important -- and concrete -- help Zelensky appears likely to get in Washington is commitments of new air defence systems to better defend Ukraine's skies.\n\nKyiv said back in April that it desperately needed seven more Patriot missile systems to help intercept Russia's devastating attacks.\n\nSince then only three advanced air defence systems have been offered -- by Germany, Romania and Italy.\n\nThe United States is one of the most reluctant NATO countries on moving Ukraine closer to membership\n\nReportedly, the United States is now mulling over announcing a further Patriot system for Kyiv, while a Dutch-led initiative to assemble another could yield results.\n\n\"I think we'll have some additional good news for them on that front,\" a senior US official said.\n\nAhead of the summit, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington will provide a new $2.3 billion package including key air defence.\n\nOne diplomat said that while the rest of the summit might \"lack meat\", getting more air defences could at least leave Zelensky feeling like he had scored a win.\n\n\"What would you want more? Nice words in a declaration that don't mean much or military support?\" the diplomat asked.\n\n\"If you're the Ukrainian president you obviously want the military support.\"", "source": {"uri":

The summit declaration, signed by all 32 NATO nations, offers some of the strongest language yet about the organization's intent to eventually include Ukraine in its membership.\n\nUkraine and its protection are a central part of this year's NATO summit in Washington, D.C., hosted by President Biden. The declaration, which encompasses NATO's beliefs and goals, says Ukraine \"has become increasingly interoperable and politically integrated with the alliance.\"\n\n\"We welcome the concrete progress Ukraine has made since the Vilnius Summit on its required democratic, economic, and security reforms,\" the declaration says. \"As Ukraine continues this vital work, we will continue to support it on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership. We reaffirm that we will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met.\"\n\nHowever, the alliance's statement did not offer a specific timeline for membership for Ukraine, which has sought to formalize its ties with Europe and the U.S. When NATO leaders convened one year ago, they affirmed that Ukraine would eventually become a member of the organization. Last year, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ukraine had made \"good progress\" toward membership but needed to do more, including enacting military and democratic reforms. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was critical of last year's statement.\n\nRead more: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nato-summit-ukraine-membership-declaration/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member states of NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vilnius"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vilnius"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717162", "eventUri": "eng-9717162", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-07-", "textStart": 30, "textEnd": 37}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Putin just met with the North Korean leader (and) we know that North Korea and Russia are coming closer and closer ... So this demonstrates how what happens in Europe matters for Asia, Korea, and what happens in Asia and Korea matters for Europe,\" he added.\n\nCalling South Korea an \"important partner\" for NATO, the secretary general elucidated the growing potential for cooperation between South Korea and NATO.\n\n\"We are looking at how we can work more closely together, including when it comes to expanding together defense industry cooperation. South Korea has an advanced defense industry,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there's a great potential to do more together on technology on cyber, and also we're looking into how we can have better systems and methods for exchange of information because that will help to strengthen the security both for South Korea and NATO allies.\"\n\nHe added that the 32-member alliance and South Korea have \"flagship\" projects to further deepen bilateral cooperation. He did not elaborate further.\n\nSouth Korea has deepened cooperation with the transatlantic alliance with the establishment of a diplomatic mission to NATO in November 2022 and other collaborative efforts amid North Korea's persistent military threats, China's growing assertiveness and other challenges.", "source": {"uri": "en.yna.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yonhap News Agency"},

He also urged co-operation to confront new security threats that transcend geographical boundaries, such as cyberattacks and conflicts in space.\n\nSouth Korea, Australia and New Zealand, which with Japan are known as the Indo-Pacific Four (IP4), are also attending the July 10-11 meeting with Nato leaders.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said this week that he planned to discuss the threat Pyongyang poses to Europe by deepening its Russia ties.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed a mutual defence pledge with Russia last month during President Valdimir Putin's first visit to Pyongyang in 24 years, and expressed his \"full support\" for Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nHelping Moscow\n\nThe US and its allies have accused Pyongyang of providing ballistic missiles and artillery shells that Russia has used in its war in Ukraine and say they fear Moscow in return could provide support for North Korea's nuclear missile development.\n\nWashington has also said China is supplying drone and missile technology, satellite imagery and machine tools to Russia, items which fall short of lethal assistance but are helping Moscow build its military to sustain the Ukraine war. Beijing has said it has not provided any weaponry to any party.\n\nWithout naming China, Kishida said \"some countries\" have allegedly transferred dual-use civilian-military goods to Russia that have served \"as a lifeline\" for its Ukraine war.\n\n\"It is necessary to grapple with such situations in a multifaceted and strategic manner, taking a panoramic view that considers the full range of international actors fuelling Russia's attempt to change the status quo by force,\" he said.\n\n\"The geographical boundary of 'Euro-Atlantic' or 'Indo-Pacific' is no longer relevant in safeguarding global peace and security. Japan and Indo-Pacific partners can play a great role for Nato allies from this perspective.\"\n\nConstrained by decades of pacifism, Tokyo has been reluctant to supply lethal aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt has, however, provided financial aid to Kyiv, spearheaded efforts to prepare for its postwar reconstruction, and contributed to Nato's fund to provide Ukraine with nonlethal equipment such as antidrone detection systems.\n\nTokyo has also repeatedly warned about the risks of a similar conflict emerging in East Asia, where China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance towards its territorial claims including the democratic island of Taiwan.\n\n\"This summit is a critical opportunity for Japan, the US and the other Nato allies to confront the ongoing challenges against the international order and to reaffirm values and principles that have shaped global peace and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nThere may be limits however, over how far Nato members are prepared to go in forging closer ties in Asia. A plan that surfaced last year for Nato to open a liaison office in Japan, its first in Asia, was blocked by France and criticised by China.", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType":

The draft details China's supply of dual-use materials such as weapons components, equipment and raw materials that serve as inputs for Russia's defense sector.\n\nThe U.S. briefed NATO allies on China's support in the run-up to the summit as part of efforts to cement shared concern over the burgeoning defense partnership, the people said. The draft document says that China poses \"systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security,\" including through cyber activities and disinformation as well as its development of counter-space capabilities.\n\nThe wording of the draft could change before the final version is released Thursday.\n\n\"Our normal trade with Russia is done aboveboard,\" Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in an emailed statement. \"China does not provide weapons to the parties to the conflict and strictly controls the export of dual-use articles.\"\n\nSwedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson said \"it would be very unwise\" for China to deliver weapons to Russia.\n\nAllies have pointed out \"that China and Russia are collaborating deeply in the defense field,\" including with more joint military exercises and Beijing providing a lot of dual-use equipment, Jonson said in an interview. \"They've been increasing that support and that's a great concern.\"\n\nU.S. officials have said China is holding off directly providing weapons and artillery, something that would signal an unprecedented escalation and almost certainly trigger more forceful action -- such as sanctions -- against the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nStill, European capitals were alarmed by reports this month that Chinese and Russian companies are developing an attack drone similar to an Iranian model deployed in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported earlier.\n\nThe push from NATO shows a growing consensus between the U.S. and its partners that Beijing represents a threat not just in Asia, but also to European security through its support for Russia. In recent years, European capitals from Berlin to London, Prague and Vilnius have hardened their stance on China.\n\nBloomberg also reported in April that Beijing was providing Russia with satellite imagery for military purposes, microelectronics and machine tools for tanks, as well as a swath of technologies used in weapons or needed to produce them.\n\nBack in May, former U.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps provoked a tiff with Washington when he suggested that China was working to provide Russia with lethal aid. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that to date, the U.S. hadn't seen China providing weapons directly to Russia.\n\n(With assistance from Milda Seputyte and Andrea Palasciano.)\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.

On Wednesday, the defence bloc called Beijing a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nSlamming Nato, China stated that the declaration is full of \"belligerent rhetoric... lies, incitement and smears.\"\n\n\"NATO should stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry, and do more to contribute to world peace and stability,\" a spokesperson for Beijing's mission to the European Union said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"As we all know, China is not the creator of the crisis in Ukraine,\" the Chinese official furthered. The spokesperson went on to insist that Beijing has always worked towards promoting peace talks between the two warring nations.\n\n\"China's core position on the Ukraine issue is to promote peace talks and political settlement, which has been widely recognised and appreciated by the international community,\" said the spokesperson.\n\nNato's declaration slams Russia but drags China as well\n\nIn the final communique, approved by the 32 Nato members at the summit in Washington, the concerns over the growing ties between Russia and China took the top spot. In the statement which is touted as the most serious rebuke against Beijing from the alliance, concerns were also raised about Beijing's growing nuclear arsenal and its capabilities in space.\n\nAs a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the declaration asked China to \"cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort.\" The group also recognized the Indo-Pacific as \"important for Nato\".

The US briefed its Nato allies on China's support in the run-up to the summit, according to reports. The declaration says that China poses \"systemic challenges to Euro-Atlantic security\", including through cyber activities and disinformation as well as its development of counter-space capabilities. But US officials have said that China is still holding off directly providing weapons and artillery.\n\nTensions between Beijing and Washington have been growing thanks to China's increasing aggression in the South China Sea, but the new declarations suggests that the West increasingly sees China as a threat to European security, thanks to its support of Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nSo far, Washington has shied away from escalating those tensions by saying Beijing is directly supplying Russia with weapons. For its part, China has also been openly supplying Russia with dual-use goods, but refrained, publicly, from overtly selling Russia military supplies.\n\nNow relations between China and Nato have taken another step down the ladder. The US provided intelligence evidence to Nato countries to overcome scepticism about China's involvement during the Nato summit, in which the US Treasury Department published the names of Chinese front companies and manufacturers funnelling technology to Russia. Hong Kong in particular, has become a major conduit for the flow of technology into Russia.\n\nThe Nato declaration also accused China of engaging in \"malicious cyber and hybrid activities, including disinformation\" targeting the US and Europe. In response, China has denied being a significant factor in the war and has accused Washington of hypocrisy, highlighting the substantial military aid the US provides to Ukraine.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin called the US accusations \"hypocritical and highly irresponsible\" in May, without denying the specifics of the claims, according to NYT.\n\nAs bne IntelliNews reported, technology sanctions have failed to stem the flow of machinery and microchips to Russia, with imports of technology in 2023 totalling only 2% less than pre-war in monetary terms.\n\nThe accusation was contained in a declaration approved by the 32 Nato leaders before a dinner at the White House and will take tension up a notch. The declaration warned that China's growing support for Russia will have \"negative repercussions.\"\n\n\"China cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation,\" the declaration stated, specifically pointing to China's \"large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base,\" the NYT reports.\n\nWhile the declaration did not detail any specific repercussions, the threat of economic sanctions has long hung over Beijing, which has been careful to avoid bringing down sanctions on its banks and companies that could harm its $1 trillion of annual exports to the collective West. China is much more exposed to trade with the West than Russia, which was easily able to reorientate its commodity-dominated exports to new markets in Asia after extreme sanctions were imposed in 2022.\n\nHowever, imposing trade sanctions on China is likely to have an even more extreme boomerang effect on Europe than those imposed on Russia has had as China is a major export market for European goods in particular. For example, Germany is heavily dependent on the Chinese market for high-end cars and luxury goods exports.\n\nChina has joined Russian President Vladimir Putin in opposing what they call the \"unipolar hegemony of the US\" and called for a multipolar global set up that could be overseen by bodies like the UN. Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping declared a \"partnership without limits\" during a three-day trip to Moscow in March 2023 that was an open act of defiance of Western criticism of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and openly positioned China as in conflict with the West for the first time.\n\nPutin followed that visit up with his own trip to Beijing in May where he held in-depth wide-ranging talks with Xi on their joint response to sanctions and the US-led attempts to limit their partnership. In a sign of Russia's growing closeness to China, Xi gave Putin a bear hug at their first meeting, a very unusual gesture in Chinese diplomacy.\n\nIn another sign of the growing multinational dimension to the BRICS countries cooperation and defiance of the threat of sanctions, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi just completed a similar two-day visit to Moscow in defiance of Western pressure to cut business ties with Russia and signed off on a string of deals to bolster trade and investment. Modi likewise gave Putin a bear hug on their first meeting and defiantly said Western criticism would be ignored in the face of what is in India's own national interests.\n\nThe Biden administration has become increasingly aggressive in its meetings with Xi this year. Both US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen travelled to Beijing early this year to meet Xi, and both threatened Xi with sanctions and trade tariffs if Beijing didn't reduce its cooperation with Moscow. Xi's entreaties to put relations back on a more consolatory and cooperative basis were ignored.\n\nBlinken has been a Russia, China hawk since he took over as Secretary of State two years ago, calling Russia an \"enemy\" and China the \"leading US rival\" in his first major foreign policy speech in March 2021.\n\nThe new escalation in tensions threatens to undo any progress made in US-China relations during the November meeting between US President Joe Biden and Xi in California. At that meeting, Biden had warned Xi about interfering in the 2024 presidential election, but evidence of China's substantial role in supporting Russia's war effort was not yet available.", "source":

industry by transferring dual-use materials and components, as well as engaging in \"malicious cyber and hybrid activities.\"\n\nResponding to the allegations on Thursday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Mission to the EU described them as \"provocative with obvious lies and smears.\" Beijing has \"lodged serious representations with\" the bloc, the spokesperson added.\n\nBeijing also warned NATO from expanding into the Asia-Pacific and disrupting peace in the region, accusing a \"certain power\" of attempting to \"maintain hegemony.\"\n\n\"NATO should stop hyping up the so-called China

We condemn all those who are facilitating and thereby prolonging Russia's war in Ukraine,\" the alliance said in the communique.\n\nNato's planned statement is full of \"belligerent rhetoric\" and the China-related content has provocations and lies, a spokesperson for the Chinese mission to the European Union said.\n\n\"As we all know, China is not the creator of the crisis in Ukraine,\" the spokesperson said, according to a statement released by the Chinese mission to the EU on Thursday.\n\n\"The declaration of the Nato summit in Washington is full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content is full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears,\" the spokesperson said in response to a reporter's question.\n\nUS officials have said China is holding off directly providing weapons and artillery, something that would signal an unprecedented escalation and almost certainly trigger more forceful action - such as sanctions - against the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nStill, European capitals were alarmed by reports this month that Chinese and Russian companies were developing an attack drone similar to an Iranian model deployed in Ukraine, Bloomberg reported earlier.\n\nThe push from Nato shows a growing consensus between the US and its partners that Beijing represents a threat not just in Asia, but also to European security through its support for Russia. In recent years, European capitals from Berlin to London, Prague and Vilnius have hardened their stance on China.\n\nBeijing put forward a 12-point paper more than a year ago that set out general principles for ending the war but did not get into specifics. It received a lukewarm reception at the time in both Russia and Ukraine.\n\nFor its part, China has repeatedly lashed out at Nato criticisms and has warned against its expansion into the Asia-Pacific region. - Agencies", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dual-use technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vilnius"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vilnius"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/5APBMDRW62CHK7Z7UKBE7A3XKU.jpg?smart=true&auth=b6791328a0f3508cf7219d3571a9d411c4e65b15a027227e492605503809a574&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717162", "eventUri": "eng-9717162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

The two leaders plan to hold a joint press appearance after their meeting.\n\n\"I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm a sustainable cooperative relationship between NATO and its Indo-Pacific partners,\" Kishida told reporters before leaving Tokyo.\n\nBased on the idea that the security of the Indo-Pacific region and Europe is inseparable, Tokyo has been working to strengthen its relations with NATO in recent years, along with other like-minded countries that share fundamental values such as democracy.\n\nAlthough Japan is not a member of NATO, Kishida is scheduled to join its summit for the third consecutive year to demonstrate Japan's solidarity with the trans-Atlantic alliance against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which started in February 2022.\n\nIn a speech at the summit, Kishida is set to call upon NATO members to deepen their involvement in the Asia-Pacific region, where China has stepped up its military assertiveness and North Korea has repeatedly launched ballistic missiles, Japanese officials said.\n\nOn the sidelines of the three-day summit, which kicked off Tuesday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the alliance, the leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and NATO are poised to meet, Kishida said.\n\nThe four nations in the Indo-Pacific region, collectively called IP4, are also arranging to hold a gathering in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will participate, he added.\n\nThe NATO summit will be held amid intensifying \"information warfare.\" According to sources close to the matter, a large amount of false information has been spread by Russia on its war in Ukraine and by China on its military drills near Taiwan, a self-ruled democratic island Beijing claims as its own territory.\n\nIn Washington, meanwhile, Kishida said he will hold bilateral talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who took office last week after his Labour Party ended 14 years of Conservative rule in a general election, and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.\n\nOn Friday, Kishida will travel to Berlin to meet with Scholz. They are expected to exchange views on economic security issues, including a growing concern over China's overproduction of electric vehicles, solar panels and other key products, the officials said.\n\nJapan and Germany agreed on a wide range of cooperation during their first high-level intergovernmental talks when Scholz visited Tokyo in March 2023. In the same year, Japan ceded its status as the world's third-largest economy to Germany.\n\nOn the security front, earlier this year, the two countries signed the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement, or ACSA, which simplifies the process of sharing food, fuel and ammunition between the Japan Self-Defense Forces and the German military.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nNATO to launch 4 new

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and the leaders of three other Indo-Pacific countries -- Japan, Australia and New Zealand -- have been invited to the summit.\n\nAsked to comment on the future of arms transactions between Moscow and Pyongyang, the official noted that \"the biggest thing\" that Russia needs from the North at this point are artillery munitions and ballistic missiles.\n\n\"Those are the two things that they are getting from North Korea now and certainly making use of on the battlefield,\" he said. \"We've seen North Korean missiles being used and, and we see them having an impact there.\"\n\nWashington has revealed that the North provided Russia with more than 11,000 containers of munitions and related material and dozens of ballistic missiles for use in Ukraine.\n\nIn return, the North has been seeking assistance from Moscow, including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles and ballistic missile production equipment, according to U.S. officials.\n\nIn a separate briefing, another senior NATO official pointed out that NATO and its Indo-Pacific partners are facing a \"very similar\" set of issues that have created momentum for their cooperation.\n\n\"They face, in many ways, a quite similar set of issues. They face at least one big authoritarian country which is testing the international rules-based order, which is using military coercion to try and achieve political goals,\" the official said.\n\n\"They face similar issues in terms of rebuilding military capabilities so that they are themselves able to ensure deterrence and defense. They have to also think about the changing nuclear picture with both North Korea and China and they're dealing with hybrid threats,\" he added.\n\nThe official also said that South Korea has become an \"important industrial partner\" for many NATO allies.\n\n\"It's not some, per se, about NATO getting involved in the Indo-Pacific directly, but it's about facing a very similar set of issues learning from each other and supporting each other,\" he said.\n\nThe leaders of NATO's Indo-Pacific partners are set to participate in talks on Thursday to discuss a range of issues, including resilience,

Its aim, according to NATO, was \"to address the challenges facing the Alliance and further strengthen NATO's deterrence and defense.\"\n\nAhead of the summit, on June 22, 2024, the Russian media outlet Russia Today published an article by renowned Russian academic Fyodor Lukyanov titled \"This is the only way to end confrontation between Russia and the West.\"\n\nIn the article, Lukyanov argued that after the end of the Cold war, the West felt that it, as the winning side, had the right to determine the structure of Europe. \"This was not simply a display of conscious arrogance, but rather of joyful euphoria. It seemed that from now on, things would always be like this,\" Lukyanov wrote. He added that as a result of NATO's \"expansion\" eastward, Russia moved further and further to the east.\n\nAccording to Lukyanov, the current Russia-NATO crisis, in particular the conflict in Ukraine, can end only when NATO's \"main goal and function\" is be abandoned, writing: \"Russia's memorandum of December 2021 and the 2022 military operation in Ukraine were designed to put an end to the idea of NATO's uncontested expansion as the only means of ensuring European security. Two and a half years later, we see that the scale of the conflict has exceeded all initial expectations. Judging by Moscow's statements, the confrontation may only come to an end when the principles on which European security is based are fundamentally reconsidered.\"\n\n'There Never Was A Real Chance To Establish A True Partnership Between Russia And NATO'\n\n\"Russia's then-Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev signed up to NATO's Partnership for Peace program in Brussels on June 22, 1994. This marked the beginning of official relations between the Russian Federation and the US-led bloc (prior to that, the USSR and NATO were involved in political dialogue within the framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, but it was established only several days before the dissolution of the Soviet Union).\n\n\"The history of cooperation between Russia and NATO was quite rich and interesting. Over the years, we saw a strange mix of good intentions, political hypocrisy, and mutual misunderstandings which sometimes arose naturally and at other times were deliberate. Experts often talk about unrealized opportunities between the two sides, but this is debatable. In fact, there never was a real chance to establish a true partnership between Russia and NATO, although at some point there were certain illusions regarding this.\n\n\"The Partnership for Peace program originally served a double goal: it was an alternative to NATO membership, but also a preparatory step for joining the organization (at least for some countries). When the program was launched, a final decision on the expansion of NATO had not yet been made. Discussions in Washington continued, but the scales generally tipped in favor of spreading its tentacles.\n\n\"Russia opposed the idea, but was not consistent. Kozyrev warned about the consequences of expansion, but repeatedly said NATO was not Russia's enemy. Russian President Boris Yeltsin dissuaded Western leaders from growing the bloc, but at the same time told Polish President Lech Walesa that Moscow was not against Warsaw's accession. At the time, the Partnership for Peace initiative looked like a life-saving compromise. However, two years later, NATO finally announced that it would admit the first group of former communist countries.\n\nAfter The Cold War, 'The West Felt That It, As The Winning Side, Had The Right To Determine The Structure Of Europe'\n\n\"Currently, the prevailing view in Russia is that, following the dissolution of the USSR, the US and its allies embarked on a course of a military and political takeover of the former Soviet sphere of influence, and NATO became the main instrument in achieving this. Although this is what eventually happened, the initial motivation might not have been that straightforward. The West's easy and unexpected success in the Cold War created a feeling of unconditional victory - a political and economic success, but most importantly, a moral one.\n\n\"The West felt that it, as the winning side, had the right to determine the structure of Europe and knew exactly how to go about it. This was not simply a display of conscious arrogance, but rather of joyful euphoria. It seemed that, from now on, things would always be like this.\n\n\"The concept adopted at the end of the Cold War stated that NATO ensured European security, and a bigger NATO meant a more secure continent. As a first step towards this, everyone (including Moscow) agreed that a reunited Germany would remain a member of the bloc instead of receiving neutral status, as some had suggested earlier. Further, it was implied that each country had the right to choose whether or not to join any alliances. Theoretically, that is what sovereignty implies. But in practice, the geopolitical balance of power had always imposed restrictions that forced alliances to consider the reaction of non-member countries. However, the triumphalism that reigned in the West following the Cold War significantly reduced the willingness to take such reactions into account. In other words, NATO felt like it could do anything and no reply would follow.\n\n'NATO's Expansion... Pushed Russia Further And Further To The East'\n\n\"The situation could have changed dramatically if Russia had considered the possibility of joining NATO, and if the bloc itself had considered such a scenario. Then the principle of the indivisibility of security, proclaimed in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, would have been respected within the framework of the bloc. However, it was impossible for Russia to join NATO, since, even at its weakest, Russia remained one of the world's largest military powers and possessed the largest nuclear arsenal. The hypothetical accession of such a state to NATO would mean the emergence of a second force within the club that would be on a par with the US, and therefore, would not obey it on the same level as other allies. This would change the very essence of the organization, and alter its principles of Atlanticism (simply because of Russia's geographical location). No one was prepared for this. The qualitative transformation of NATO was never on the agenda.\n\n\"As a result, NATO's expansion, which in a sense became automated, pushed Russia further and further to the east. Moscow's attempts to regulate this process - first through participation in joint institutions (such as the NATO-Russia Council of 2002, which was an expansion of the NATO-Russia Founding Act of 1997) and then through growing opposition (starting with Putin's Munich Speech in 2007) - did not bring the desired results. In addition to the inertia of the West's initial approach (which implied that the bloc's very existence is security in itself), the West believed that Moscow didn't have the right to set conditions and must only follow the rules set by the stronger and more successful Western community. This is how the EU eventually got involved in the current Ukraine war.\n\n'There's Still No Partnership Or Peace Between Russia And NATO'\n\n\"Could relations between NATO and Russia have developed in a different way? The West believes that the persistence of Russia, which continued to consider NATO a threat to its security, led to the current military crisis. And, in fact, this became a self-fulfilling prophecy. But even assuming that this was true, the speed and ease with which NATO returned to a strong confrontation with Russia shows that it had been prepared for this.\n\n\"Russia's memorandum of December 2021 and the 2022 military operation in Ukraine were designed to put an end to the idea of NATO's uncontested expansion as the only means of ensuring European security. Two-and-a-half years later, we see that the scale of the conflict has exceeded all initial expectations. Judging by Moscow's statements, the confrontation may only come to an end when the principles on which European security is based are fundamentally reconsidered.\n\n\"This is not a territorial conflict, but a conflict which may only end when NATO abandons its main goal and function. So far, there is no compromise on the horizon. The Western side is not willing to agree that the results of the Cold War must be reconsidered, and the Russian side is not ready to retreat without this assurance. Thirty years after the signing of the Partnership for Peace program, there's still no partnership or peace between Russia and NATO. And neither is there a clear understanding of why the two sides were unable to achieve it.\"", "source": {"uri": "memri.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "MEMRI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The two leaders plan to hold a joint press appearance after their meeting.\n\n\"I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm a sustainable cooperative relationship between NATO and its Indo-Pacific partners,\" Kishida told reporters before leaving Tokyo.\n\nBased on the idea that the security of the Indo-Pacific region and Europe is inseparable, Tokyo has been working to strengthen its relations with NATO in recent years, along with other like-minded countries that share fundamental values such as democracy.\n\nAlthough Japan is not a member of NATO, Kishida is scheduled to join its summit for the third consecutive year to demonstrate Japan's solidarity with the trans-Atlantic alliance against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which started in February 2022.\n\nIn a speech at the summit, Kishida is set to call upon NATO members to deepen their involvement in the Asia-Pacific region, where China has stepped up its military assertiveness and North Korea has repeatedly launched ballistic missiles, Japanese officials said.\n\nOn the sidelines of the three-day summit, which kicked off Tuesday to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the alliance, the leaders of Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and NATO are poised to meet, Kishida said.\n\nThe four nations in the Indo-Pacific region, collectively called IP4, are also arranging to hold a gathering in which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will participate, he added.\n\nThe NATO summit will be held amid intensifying \"information warfare.\" According to sources close to the matter, a large amount of false information has been spread by Russia on its war in Ukraine and by China on its military drills near Taiwan, a self-ruled democratic island Beijing claims as its own territory.\n\nIn Washington, meanwhile, Kishida said he will hold bilateral talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who took office last week after his Labour Party ended 14 years of Conservative rule in a general election, and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.\n\nOn Friday, Kishida will travel to Berlin to meet with Scholz. They are expected to exchange views on economic security issues, including a growing concern over China's overproduction of electric vehicles, solar panels and other key products, the officials said.\n\nJapan and Germany agreed on a wide range of cooperation during their first high-level intergovernmental talks when Scholz visited Tokyo in March 2023.

Nice words in a declaration that don't mean much or military support?\" the diplomat asked.\n\n\"If you're the Ukrainian president you obviously want the military support.\"\n\ndel/ec/ach/bc\n\nMore

Kerry Buck was Canada's ambassador to NATO and is a board member at the CDA Institute.\n\nNATO heads of state and government are gathering in Washington, D.C., this week to update their strategic priorities and convey the continued relevance of the alliance, celebrating its 75th anniversary with pomp. By traditional metrics, NATO is a robust and successful international organization. Not only has it managed to survive for more than seven decades, it has grown from an alliance of 12 member states to 32 allies and counting (Sweden being the latest member).\n\nWhat explains the alliance's endurance?\n\nPooling resources and defence capabilities is certainly part of the story, and this has been an advantageous bargain for Canada, just as NORAD has been. NATO has combined defence spending of almost US$1.5-trillion in 2024. However high this figure might seem, though, it is the shared values and principles enshrined in NATO's foundational treaty that keep the alliance on a growth trajectory. If military strength alone mattered, then Russia and China would have an easier time making friends.\n\nRussia and NATO are not in a popularity contest, but if they were, it would not be a close one. However, NATO's strategic competitors have caught on to the alliance's appeal and want to fracture it. Russia has been deterred from invading a NATO country to date, but Moscow is hell-bent on challenging NATO's position as a pre-eminent military organization. The easiest way to do this while engaging in a full-fledged and brutal war in Ukraine is by aggressively attempting to undermine NATO values.\n\nEvery day, as Russia continues its devastating war in Ukraine, it is also attacking the rules-based order that has made Canada secure and prosperous since the end of the Second World War. Russia's horrendous bombing of a children's hospital in Kyiv on July 8 is yet another grave violation of international humanitarian law. Every day, Russia is more directly attacking Canada and its allies through cyber-attacks and relentless disinformation meant to undermine public trust in our democratic institutions and further polarize our societies. For example, Russia has resorted to technology-facilitated gender-based violence, deliberately targeting women through online harassment and threats, stoking the flames of gender-based hatred in the West in the process. Incidents of women in the public sphere being hounded or antagonized have been on the rise in recent years, which has a chilling effect on women's political participation. When people in our societies decide not to run for office, or quit politics out of fear for their safety, our democracy and way of life are seriously compromised. This must stop.\n\nTo this end, NATO leaders endorsed the Women, Peace, and Security Policy on July 10, explicitly recognizing that when women's rights are protected, countries are more secure. This renewed NATO commitment mirrors Canada's own efforts to advance gender equality, as we released a National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security earlier this year.\n\nThese NATO (and Canadian) values contribute tangibly to lasting peace and stability, and are fundamental to the health of democracies worldwide. We know that countries that fail women also fail as states; they are more violent and poorer as a result. Russia is fuelling the global backlash against women's rights and human rights through toxic propaganda, as another way to undercut Western states and NATO as an alliance.\n\nThese types of hybrid warfare tactics were explicitly called out in NATO's 2022 Strategic Concept, a capstone document reflecting the consensus of the allies. It notes that \"strategic competitors test our resilience and seek to exploit the openness, interconnectedness and digitalization of our nations.\" This was further reinforced by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a kick-off event to the 2024 summit, as he stated the abuse of women online \"is a threat to the health of our democracies, and we're taking steps to push back.\"\n\nBy studying the war in Ukraine, NATO has learned that targeted disinformation campaigns have tracked closely to conventional attacks on the ground. Disinformation is not just operating below the surface of the conflict; it has been fully weaponized as part of this ground war in Europe.\n\nFor its 75th anniversary, NATO allies are not only bolstering their collective defences (which are essential to the territorial integrity of all 32 members), but they are also reaffirming the values, principles and ideals that have kept NATO going since 1949. NATO is a political and military alliance - it can only live to be 100 if it prioritizes both defences and values. It has to heed both sides of the coin.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nice words in a declaration that don't mean much or military support?\" the diplomat asked.\n\n\"If you're the Ukrainian president you obviously want the military support.\"", "source": {"uri":

Ukraine", "body": "China hits out at Nato's 'Cold War mentality' and 'belligerent rhetoric' over Ukraine\n\nNicola Smith\n\n11 July 2024 at 11:16 am\n\nChina has called Nato a belligerent liar as it lashed out at the \"Cold War\" claims that it was supporting Russia's military.\n\nBeijing warned Nato against \"provoking confrontation\" after the Western security alliance accused China of being a \"decisive enabler\" of Moscow's war against Ukraine.\n\nNato's first-of-its-kind warning to China urged the world's second-largest economy, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to \"cease all material and political support to Russia's war effort\".\n\nThe statement, which followed an annual meeting of the 32 leaders of the alliance's members, said Beijing \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation\".\n\nJens Stoltenberg, Nato's secretary general, described the language as the \"strongest message Nato allies have ever sent on China's contributions to Russia's illegal war against Ukraine\".\n\nChina claims neutrality in the conflict while at the same time providing an economic lifeline to and deepening strategic ties with Russia, which is subject to international sanctions.\n\nMr Stoltenberg told reporters in Washington that China provides equipment, microelectronics and tools that are allowing Russia \"to build the missiles, to build the bombs, to build the aircraft, to build the weapons they use to attack Ukraine\".\n\nChina has always denied these claims.\n\nA spokesman for Beijing's mission to the European Union hit back at Nato's statement, saying it should \"stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry, and do more to contribute to world peace and stability\".\n\nThe summit declaration was \"full of Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric, and China-related content is full of provocations, lies, incitement and smears,\" he said, adding that \"China is not the creator of the crisis in Ukraine\" and was committed to promoting peace talks.\n\nBeijing's stern rebuke comes amid a surge in Chinese military activity in the Pacific.\n\nTaiwan said on Thursday that it was closely observing a sizeable swarm of 66 Chinese warplanes operating around its territory, 36 of which were heading for exercises in the Western Pacific with the aircraft carrier Shandong.\n\nThe country's defence ministry also released images of a Chinese J-16 fighter jet and a nuclear capable H-6 bomber, which it said had been taken recently although it did not reveal where or when.\n\nOn Wednesday, China's foreign ministry said it firmly opposed Nato \"inserting itself into the Asia-Pacific\" to disrupt \"stability and prosperity in this region.\"\n\nHowever, ahead of the Nato summit, Taiwan's foreign ministry said it welcomed the alliance's \"continuous increase in attention to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region in recent years.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label":

It is a major departure for NATO, which until 2019 never officially mentioned China as a concern, and then only in the blandest of language. Now, for the first time, the alliance has joined in Washington's denunciations of China's military support for Russia.

However, the receipts were overshadowed by Biden freezing up during the event and having to be escorted offstage by former President Barack Obama. - NY Post\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrapped up a high-stakes visit to Moscow on July 9 -- his first to Russia since 2019 -- that highlighted the fine line New Delhi treads as it bolsters relations with Russia while courting closer ties with the West. On the second and final day of Modi's visit to the Russian capital, India and Russia set out nine key areas for closer cooperation, ranging from nuclear energy to medicine, with officials from both sides saying they aimed to boost bilateral trade by more than half to hit $100 billion by 2030. While the 22nd India-Russia annual summit focused on bilateral cooperation, it took place against the backdrop of wider geopolitical turmoil sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The meeting in Moscow on July 9 also coincided with the opening of a high-profile summit of NATO leaders in Washington, as well as the Russian bombing of a children's hospital in Kyiv. Modi did appear to reference that attack in comments to Putin on July 9, saying that \"when innocent children are murdered, one sees them die, the heart pains and that pain is unbearable.\" - RFE/RL\n\nPolice in Iran shut down the Turkish Airlines office in the capital of Tehran after female employees there apparently refused to wear the mandatory headscarf, or hijab, in an act of defiance of the country's law. The semi-official Tasnim news agency said police officers went to the Turkish Airlines office in Tehran on Monday to issue what is called a first warning over the \"non-observance of hijab\" by the company's employees. However, the employees -- who are Iranian nationals -- reportedly \"made trouble for the police officers,\" prompting the closure. The Tasnim report said police subsequently sealed the office over the employees' behavior. - ABC News", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It is a reflection of the fact that their theatres of work together are linked.\n\n\"May be this was crystallised by Ukraine, when Prime Minister (Fumio) Kishida of Japan said that what is happening in Europe today could be happening in East Asia tomorrow.\n\n\"When Russia committed its aggression, its renewed aggression against Ukraine, and Japan stood up, South Korea stood up, Australia, New Zealand, this was a reflection of that recognition that these challenges are linked. And when democracies stand together, whether they are in Europe, Asia or elsewhere, we are going to be stronger and more effective,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"So as we are gathering here in Washington with our Indo-Pacific partners, what this means is we are breaking down the silos between Europe, Asia and the United States. This has been a very deliberate objective of President Biden from day one, not only building convergence with our allies, stronger convergence when it comes to how to approach Russia -- and in a different way, how to approach China -- but also breaking down the barriers, the walls between European partners and Asian partners,\" he added.\n\n\"What has happened just in the last year, year and a half has only reinforced the imperative. We see, unfortunately, China not providing weapons to Russia to pursue its aggression but being the major contributor to Russia's defence industrial base. Seventy per cent of the machine tools that Russia is importing are coming from China, 90 per cent of the microelectronics that Russia uses is coming from China. And that has enabled it to sustain its aggression against Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"We have seen a massive buildup of its weaponry over the last year and a half -- tanks, missiles, munitions.

It is a reflection of the fact that their theatres of work together are linked.\n\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Modi Meeting With Austrian Leaders, Including Federal President Alexander Van Der Bellen, To Expand India-Austria Cooperation (Watch Video).\n\n\"May be this was crystallised by Ukraine, when Prime Minister (Fumio) Kishida of Japan said that what is happening in Europe today could be happening in East Asia tomorrow.\n\n\"When Russia committed its aggression, its renewed aggression against Ukraine, and Japan stood up, South Korea stood up, Australia, New Zealand, this was a reflection of that recognition that these challenges are linked. And when democracies stand together, whether they are in Europe, Asia or elsewhere, we are going to be stronger and more effective,\" Blinken said.\n\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Modi Urges Austria CEOs To Invest in India's Fast-Growing Economy.\n\n\"So as we are gathering here in Washington with our Indo-Pacific partners, what this means is we are breaking down the silos between Europe, Asia and the United States. This has been a very deliberate objective of President Biden from day one, not only building convergence with our allies, stronger convergence when it comes to how to approach Russia -- and in a different way, how to approach China -- but also breaking down the barriers, the walls between European partners and Asian partners,\" he added.\n\n\"What has happened just in the last year, year and a half has only reinforced the imperative. We see, unfortunately, China not providing weapons to Russia to pursue its aggression but being the major contributor to Russia's defence industrial base. Seventy per cent of the machine tools that Russia is importing are coming from China, 90 per cent of the microelectronics that Russia uses is coming from China. And that has enabled it to sustain its aggression against Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"We have seen a massive buildup of its weaponry over the last year and a half -- tanks, missiles, munitions. That is the product of a defence industrial base being fuelled by China. As a result, European allies understand the challenge posed by China to Europe's security. And of course, China cannot have it both ways,\" he said.\n\n\"It cannot be all at once or claim to be for peace and want to have better relations with Europe -- while at the same time, fuelling what is arguably the most significant threat to European security since the end of the Cold War.\n\n\"We see it in the relationship between Russia and North Korea. That is abundantly clear. In all of these areas, as well as some of the hybrid threats that you alluded to before, the connections are clearer and clearer.

It is a major departure for Nato, which until 2019 never officially mentioned China as a concern, and then only in the blandest of language.\n\nNow, for the first time, the alliance has joined in Washington's denunciations of China's military support for Russia.\n\nBut the declaration contains an implicit threat that China's growing support for Russia will come at a cost.\n\nChina \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation\", the declaration said, particularly calling out \"its large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base\".\n\nThe Nato declaration did not specify what those costs would be, although the natural first step would be economic sanctions that barred China from parts of global markets.\n\nEven a year ago, European leaders were hesitant to challenge Beijing, especially nations like Germany that view China as a critical market for high-end cars and luxury goods.\n\nMany European leaders initially dismissed the agreement reached in early 2022, just before the Beijing Olympics, for a \"partnership without limits\" signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nEven President Joe Biden said he had his doubts that the two countries, with a long history of enmity, could work together. In March 2023, during a trip to Canada, he said, \"I think we vastly exaggerate\" the partnership.\n\n\"I've been hearing now for the past three months about 'China is going to provide significant weapons to Russia and they're gonna' - a lot of talk about that,\" Mr Biden added. \"They haven't yet.

The drills, which run from July 8 to 19, include night landing operations and overcoming water obstacles, signaling a high level of military preparedness and coordination.\n\nThe proximity of these exercises to NATO territory has generated significant coverage in the Western media and among military experts. Many in the West see the presence of Chinese troops so close to a NATO border as a provocative gesture amidst already heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nMajor General Vadim Denisenko of the Belarusian military emphasized the complexity of current global events, noting, \"Having studied new forms and ways of solving tactical problems, here we will work out all these points in the exercises. At some stages, the units will be combined, there will be no separately Chinese or separately Belarusian, they will operate together.\"\n\nThe partnership between China and Belarus reflects growing ties under Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, both strong allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin. While the West views this military cooperation as a significant development, the relationship between China and Belarus is not new.\n\nVsevolod Shimov, adviser to the president of the Russian Association of Baltic Studies, highlighted the longstanding collaboration: \"Minsk relies on powerful allies in the east, both Russia and China. At the summit in Astana, Belarus became a full member of the SCO. Now, it will be natural to intensify military cooperation with the PRC.\"\n\nOn July 4, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) officially admitted Belarus as a member during the 24th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the SCO in Astana, Kazakhstan.\n\nShimov further noted, \"Actually, such cooperation has existed before; for example, the Belarusian Multi-Barrel Rocket Launcher (MLRS) 'Polonez' (a Belarusian 300 mm rocket artillery system of a launcher unit) was developed with the help of Beijing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, NATO allies agree that China is a \"decisive enabler\" of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on July 10 at the alliance's summit in Washington.\n\nChina was mentioned in the joint member states' statement as a threat to NATO's interests and security, which Stoltenberg called \"the first time that all NATO members state this so clearly in an agreed document.\"\n\nChina has positioned itself as neutral in the ongoing war but has deepened economic ties with Russia and become Moscow's leading source of dual-use goods that feed the Russian defense industry.\n\nNATO called on China to cease supplying Russia with \"weapons components, equipment, and raw materials,\" saying that Beijing \"cannot enable the largest war in Europe in recent history without this negatively impacting its interests and reputation.\"\n\nChina's military is extending its influence far beyond its borders, signaling its ambition to rival American global military might. This expansion is not confined to its immediate neighborhood but reaches distant regions, showcasing China's growing capabilities and strategic ambitions.\n\nA notable example of this expansion is the deployment of the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Shandong Carrier Strike Group to the Philippine Sea.\n\nThe aircraft carrier Shandong is operating outside the South China Sea for the first time this year. The Shandong was last deployed to the Philippine Sea in October and November of the previous year, where it conducted flight operations with its fighter aircraft and helicopters.\n\nShandong has been actively engaged in training operations across the Pacific region. Last year, the carrier strike group was deployed three times to the western Pacific. The initial deployment occurred in April and lasted 19 days in the Philippine Sea.\n\nThis was followed by a five-day mission in September and a 12-day operation in October and November. These extended deployments highlighted China's commitment to projecting its naval power far from its shores.\n\nIn addition to these independent operations, China has been conducting joint training exercises with its strategic partner, Russia. Currently, a joint PLAN-Russian Navy patrol is operating in the Philippine Sea.\n\nRussia has also dispatched two corvettes for an Indo-Pacific deployment, emphasizing the deepening military ties between Beijing and Moscow.\n\nChina is also bolstering its military relationships with Southeast Asian countries, where Beijing and Washington are vying for influence. Recently, Chinese troops arrived in Laos for a two-week exercise with the Lao military near Vientiane.\n\nApproximately 300 Chinese troops and 900 Lao military personnel are participating in the Laos-China Friendship Shield-2024 exercise, which began on July 5. This training follows a similar exercise in Cambodia, where Chinese troops participated in the largest-ever bilateral military exercise with Cambodian forces in May.\n\nLast November, China's Guangdong province hosted a military exercise involving the armed forces of Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. Since December, Chinese warships have been spotted at a new Chinese-built pier at Cambodia's Ream Naval Base.\n\nDespite repeated denials from Cambodia about granting China exclusive military access to the base, these developments have raised questions about Beijing's strategic intentions.\n\nIn May 2024, a report highlighted the increase in military exercises conducted by the United States and China across Asia amid rising regional tensions.\n\nThe London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies \"Scripted Order\" survey revealed that between 2003 and 2022, the US conducted 1,113 exercises involving Asian countries, compared to 130 by China.\n\nWhile Beijing's exercises still lag in scale and complexity, the frequency and scope of its drills are increasing.\n\nChina's military reach extends beyond Asia to the Middle East, where sea routes are crucial for China's trade and fuel imports. The Chinese and Saudi Arabian navies have previously conducted escort and anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia. Last year, the Air Force of China and the United Arab Emirates conducted joint training exercises in China.\n\nIn the Gulf of Oman earlier this year, the navies of China, Iran, and Russia held their fifth joint exercise in recent years. This trilateral cooperation underscores China's growing military engagement in the Middle East.\n\nChina has also intensified its military diplomacy with African nations. In April 2024, China's 45th naval fleet, including the guided-missile destroyer Urumqi, missile frigate Linyi, and comprehensive replenishment vessel Dongpinghu, visited Madagascar after stops in Tanzania and Mozambique.\n\nThroughout 2023, the PLAN made port calls in Nigeria, Gabon, Ghana, Congo-Brazzaville, Angola, and South Africa.\n\nThese visits are part of Beijing's strategy to solidify security relationships with African governments and port cities, ensuring swift access when needed. China's increasing military presence indicates its desire to establish itself as a significant global military force.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Latest

'Russia will not give up its goal of controlling Ukraine unless and until Ukraine is integrated in the Western institutions - NATO and the European Union,\" he told Euronews.\n\n\"It's a wasted opportunity not to offer membership to Ukraine,\" said Ed Arnold Senior Research Fellow for European Security at Royal United Service Institute, Rusi.\n\n\"We don't have time; anyone can reverse the course of Ukraine's path because the language at this summit is not legally binding,\" he said.\n\n\"Trump can reverse it if he comes to power. And we know how Trump dislikes other people's deals, not to mention the fact that Trump has a bad history with Zelenskyy,\" he told Euronews.\n\nAs US president, Donald Trump attempted to blackmail Zelenskyy by withholding US military support for Ukraine unless he create a bogus investigation into corruption by Hunter Biden - the son of Joe Biden. The matter led to the impeachment of Trump after whistleblowers revealed the affair.\n\nUkrainian president Zelenskyy and his team including Deputy Prime Minister Stefanishnya are in Washington DC for the 75th anniversary of NATO.\n\nNATO allies significantly stepped up their contributions to Ukraine as part of this week's summit including dozens of defence systems and a timeline of the delivery of F-16 fighter jets.\n\n\"All of the announcements on air defences and Patriot systems are important but they won't move the dial for Ukrainian security - not like membership of NATO would,\" said Ed Arnold.\n\nPart of the concerns among some countries in hesitating to support Ukrainian membership is the clear liability and risk that would emerge for allies in admitting a country in the middle of an intense armed conflict. But ambassador Daalder says the only undisputed parts of Ukraine would be covered under Article 5 guarantees. Disputed areas such as Crimea, Donbass and occupied territories in the East of Ukraine would also not be covered. But Kyiv and the rest would be, which would in theory go some way in deterring Russia from attacks such as the one this week on the hospitals, including one children's hospital.\n\n\"NATO's has in the past provided security guarantees and brought in members who have territorial disputes\", said Ivo Daalder.\n\n\"This is not something new. In 1955, West Germany became a member of NATO and quite explicitly was understood that East Germany, which was still a disputed territory, was not part of NATO's territory.\"\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishnya agrees that Nato membership is the best solution, but ultimately says the only true guarantee of security is if and when Russia ceases its brutal territorial conquest, and stops bombing civilians and civilian targets.\n\n''There is much more what we need. And as long as long as people die in Ukraine, we will never feel fully able to prepare ourselves.\"\n\n\"The moment when zero Russian soldiers are on Ukrainian soil, this will be the moment where we will be able to say that people are safe,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronews", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euronews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivo_Daalder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivo Daalder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal United Services Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blackmail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_dispute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Territorial dispute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Germany"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Germany"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crimea"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/56/67/22/1200x675_cmsv2_e8050c55-d128-5039-93e3-c8e088378dbf-8566722.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717162", "eventUri": "eng-9717162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

First, China can push Russia to abandon its invasion of Ukraine. Second, it may want to do so. Both assumptions are wrong.\n\nChina and Russia have touted a \"no-limits\" relationship since February 2022, days before Russia invaded Ukraine. Indeed, the leaders of both countries most recently hailed their partnership as \"experiencing their best period in history\", at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Kazakhstan.\n\nChina has been Russia's largest trading partner for 13 years, with Chinese goods accounting for more than 30 per cent of Russia's imports. More to the point, the Russian military-industrial complex imports large amounts of components from China. Dual-use Chinese equipment like drones and light vehicles are employed by Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. Hence, Beijing has some leverage over Russia's war machine.\n\nStill, Moscow's dependency on Chinese support should not be overstated. Russia is a great power and one of the leading world economies, while Ukraine is a smaller nation short on money. A decrease in trade with China would undoubtedly harm Russia's economic prospects, but it would do little to correct the power imbalance between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nMore hurtful would be an embargo on dual-use materials and equipment. But here, too, it may not suffice to stop Russia.\n\nThe massive Russian defence industry succeeded the Soviet Union's, which did not rely on outside partners. Russia is a country of almost 150 million people with a vast industrial base and near-limitless natural resources. It can become self-sufficient if required.

And when democracies stand together, whether they are in Europe, Asia or elsewhere, we are going to be stronger and more effective,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"So as we are gathering here in Washington with our Indo-Pacific partners, what this means is we are breaking down the silos between Europe, Asia and the United States. This has been a very deliberate objective of President Biden from day one, not only building convergence with our allies, stronger convergence when it comes to how to approach Russia -- and in a different way, how to approach China -- but also breaking down the barriers, the walls between European partners and Asian partners,\" he added.\n\n\"What has happened just in the last year, year and a half has only reinforced the imperative. We see, unfortunately, China not providing weapons to Russia to pursue its aggression but being the major contributor to Russia's defence industrial base. Seventy per cent of the machine tools that Russia is importing are coming from China, 90 per cent of the microelectronics that Russia uses is coming from China. And that has enabled it to sustain its aggression against Ukraine,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"We have seen a massive buildup of its weaponry over the last year and a half -- tanks, missiles, munitions. That is the product of a defence industrial base being fuelled by China. As a result, European allies understand the challenge posed by China to Europe's security. And of course, China cannot have it both ways,\" he said.\n\n\"It cannot be all at once or claim to be for peace and want to have better relations with Europe -- while at the same time, fuelling what is arguably the most significant threat to European security since the end of the Cold War.\n\n\"We see it in the relationship between Russia and North Korea. That is abundantly clear. In all of these areas, as well as some of the hybrid threats that you alluded to before, the connections are clearer and clearer. The alliance (NATO) is one place -- and maybe, I would argue, a central place -- where we can bring everyone together so that we are acting together,\" the top American diplomat said.\n\n\"One, we are making the investments in ourselves at home to make sure that we are approaching China from a position of domestic strength. When you look at everything that has happened over the last three-and-a-half years with the incredible investments in our own infrastructure -- our roads, our bridges, our communications -- through the Infrastructure Act, when you look at our commitment to make sure that we maintain our leadership, our world leadership on microelectronics, on chips through the CHIPS and Science Act, when you look at the investments that have been made in climate technology, which is going to be a critical part of the 21st-century economy, that puts the United States in a position of strength. European allies are doing exactly the same thing,\" he said.\n\n\"But the other aspect of this is not only, as we have done, re-energise our alliances and partnerships starting with Europe, but also make sure that there is greater and greater convergence in our approach to some of the challenges posed by China.\n\n\"I think if you look at what NATO has said in the Strategic Concept, if you look at what key Europeans have said, what the European Union has said, it is abundantly clear that we have more convergence now when it comes to how to approach China than we have ever had. And that is a source of tremendous strength,\" he said.\n\nBlinken said it means that instead of having one country having to deal with the challenges alone -- the US representing maybe 20 per cent of world GDP -- suddenly they have aligned 40, 50 and with Asian partners, 60 per cent of world GDP.\n\n\"That makes a huge difference. And so precisely because these challenges are joined, dealing with some of the problems posed by China requires this work with, alignment with, convergence with Europe as well as with Asia,\" he said.

The Biden administration, which immediately signed the $61 billion aid package approved by the US Congress in April 2024 and recently authorized Kyiv's use of American weapons for limited retaliatory strikes within Russia's territory, is expected to pledge additional assistance to Ukraine, enhance NATO's indirect involvement in the war, and provide \"a strong bridge\" to the country's membership in the alliance.\n\nThat trend is understandable. Russia has proved resilient and made new territorial gains with Iran, North Korea, and (above all) China's help. It outmatches Ukraine in demographic and industrial-military terms. Moreover, the West must grapple with the rise of the Far Right in the EU, President Biden's faltering re-election prospects, and the \"radical reorientation\" that former President Trump envisions for NATO should he return to power.\n\nYet the Biden administration's buildup in Ukraine ignores how closely the US has tightened its encirclement of Russia, the diminishing returns of escalating without a clear endgame, and the unsustainability of its current course of action from a domestic political standpoint.\n\nAlthough America's Russia policy has inspired heated debates, its geostrategic underpinnings are clear: maintaining the balance of power in Europe (and other parts of Eurasia) to prevent local rivals from controlling the continent's unmatched resources. This objective largely explains Washington's post-World War I support for creating independent Central and European states between Germany and Moscow, containment of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and controversial expansion of NATO eastward since then.\n\nWhether one blames it on Putin's imperialism or the West's attempts to bring Kyiv into its sphere of influence, the Ukraine War advances the same logic. First, the Biden administration has used Russia's attack to re-assert NATO's legitimacy and help the transatlantic relationship recover (for now) from the Trump presidency. Washington supplied its allies' rearmament programs while encouraging them to bolster their defense budgets, supporting NATO's expansion to Finland and Sweden, and promoting a growing US and allied presence along Russia's Western flank.\n\nWashington also encouraged EU leaders (especially Germany) to disengage from Moscow's economy, reduce their dependency on Russian gas supply, and replace the latter with lucrative American LNG exports. Meanwhile, US-led Western sanctions devastated Russia's financial system and technological potential.\n\nThird, Washington exploited Ukraine's turn against Moscow. Its assistance to Kyiv helped \"degrade the Kremlin's capabilities\" without American casualties, making Russia suffer disproportionate losses in men and equipment without serious prospects of conquering and occupying Ukraine's whole territory. Meanwhile, Washington, NATO, American banks, and US-led international financial organizations deepened their influence over Ukraine's economy, politics, and security services. As such, the US can encircle Belarus and block Moscow's access to the Carpathian mountains that overlook the NATO-dominated North European plain - whose topography made Russia vulnerable to multiple invasions in the past. Moreover, a pro-American Ukraine creates latent vulnerability for the city of Moscow, located 500 miles of flat terrain away, and exposes the lands that lead to the Russo-Kazakh border situated 400 miles east, which could obstruct the Kremlin's access to the Caucasus, its only pathway to the Black and Caspian Seas.\n\nRussia's clout in the Black Sea region declined, too. Despite not having a Navy, Kyiv forced Moscow's fleet to retreat eastward and threatened Russian supply lines in southern Ukraine. The region's other coastal states, all NATO members except Georgia, hardened their Russia policy, further constraining Moscow's projection of influence toward the Mediterranean Sea, the Middle East, and Africa. Combined with NATO's goal of Georgia membership, this situation complicates the Kremlin's ability to counter any resurgent separatist or terrorist forces in Russian Republics such as Chechnya and Dagestan by cutting their supply lines \"south of the Greater Caucasus ridge.\"\n\nThe US cornered Russia in the Baltic region, where NATO and the EU's post-Cold War expansion had already marginalized the Kaliningrad exclave and stopped only 100 miles away from Saint Petersburg, exposing Russia's industrial core and its defense stronghold in the Kola peninsula. Besides their artillery, aircraft, and technological contributions, not to mention submarines designed for local shallow waters, Finland and Sweden's NATO entry may overstretch Moscow and help protect Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania from future Russian attempts to close the Suwalki Gap, which separates those countries from the rest of NATO. Sweden's Gotland Island, located in the heart of the Baltic Sea, could help isolate Kaliningrad, control regional air space, and disrupt Russian naval maneuvers and oil shipments.\n\nMoscow is also on the defensive in the Western Arctic. Recent deals could allow US troops to deploy in 15 Norwegian military bases. Finland will host F-35 squadrons in its northernmost region and boost NATO's deficient icebreaker shipbuilding capabilities. More broadly, the alliance's revival may exert pressure on the Kola peninsula, home of Russia's northern fleet and which oversees its Northern Sea Route to Asia. NATO may bolster its defenses along the GIUK gap (Greenland-Iceland-UK), hampering Moscow's ability to deploy across the Atlantic, reach Western Europe from the sea, block American reinforcements, and threaten the US East Coast.\n\nAltogether, those geostrategic gains should invite Washington to see Ukraine's current difficulties and the West's internal divisions not as reasons to double down endlessly but to recognize the war's diminishing returns.\n\nThe Biden administration must show it can play the long game in Ukraine. Yet, given the costs, risks, and questionable feasibility of this course of action, it should leverage its recent display of staying power to convince Kyiv, Moscow, and Washington's European allies to initiate ceasefire and peace negotiations (whose prospects are more attainable than commonly assumed). Those talks should seek Ukrainian neutrality guaranteed by third parties - as Kyiv and Moscow envisioned two years ago. Meanwhile, Washington should support the gradual development of a more autonomous EU. Diplomacy may imply difficult trade-offs. But ultimately, it is more likely to preserve Ukraine, stabilize Europe, and optimize America's grand strategy.", "source": {"uri": "realclearworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and a former spokesperson for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. He is a regular contributor to CNN Opinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nAs Washington prepares to welcome world leaders for a landmark summit commemorating 75 years of NATO, some 5,000 miles away I was having a heart wrenching dinner conversation.\n\n\"My dreams have been shattered,\" a Ukrainian friend, Inna Ivanova, told me at a restaurant tucked away in an obscure corner of Odesa.\n\nA former resident of this southern Ukrainian port city, Inna was visiting family during a break from her job as an accountant in Germany.\n\nUp until Russia's full-scale invasion two years ago, Inna was studying drama with hopes of becoming an actress. But with the frequent air raid sirens and electricity outages, like millions of other Ukrainians, Inna opted for a calmer life elsewhere.\n\nHer turmoil, however, continues.\n\nThis week, 32 NATO allies will be gathering in Washington, DC, amid what they rightly describe as \"the most dangerous security environment since the Cold War.\"\n\nThe overarching message from Ukrainians I've spoken to over the past few weeks, including Inna, is: \"Help us stop this war -- now.\"\n\nAnd indeed, catapulting Ukraine into a winning position should be the key goal of the Washington summit. Failing to push back Russian President Vladimir Putin, a man who only responds to brute force, will only prolong the war and make it more costly for Europe -- especially if many thousands of Ukrainians, unable to heat their homes, seek asylum there this winter.\n\nThe question on everyone's lips\n\nLooming over the summit will be the question of Ukraine's desperately sought NATO membership.\n\nFormer Vice-Prime Minister for the European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told me that if NATO leaders pass up the opportunity to \"signal the irreversibility of Ukraine's membership ... it will be a drastic mistake of the alliance.\"\n\nShe added that it would be a much bigger mistake for the region and the world than the \"mismanaged 2008 Bucharest NATO summit decision,\" which opened the door for Ukraine and Georgia to join the alliance, but with no plan on how to get there. (Critics argued it essentially raised a red flag to Moscow regarding two former Soviet countries but without the benefit of NATO protection.)\n\nConsidering the moves already made by Brussels towards integrating Ukraine and providing it with more predictability, Kyiv could feel that it is pretty much part of the NATO family -- save for the collective protection (known as Article 5) that full membership supposedly brings.\n\nThe Biden administration has talked about the idea of a \"bridge\" to NATO eventual membership for Ukraine, but the alliance has yet to offer Kyiv a concrete timeline. Nonetheless, NATO leaders could give themselves a pass to skirt the membership question by giving Kyiv drastically enhanced capability to repel Putin's aggression, while still providing a solid roadmap for a seat at the alliance table.\n\nThe two faces of Ukraine\n\nAfter more than two years of war, those of us who have stayed recognize newcomers or returnees such as Inna. With each passing air raid siren they anxiously scroll through Telegram channels to assess the threat (cruise missiles and ballistic missiles being the biggest).\n\nBut a brief stroll would present an Odesa that is opening up, looking less and less like a war zone. The port, the engine which powers the local economy as well as a crucial part of the global food supply chain, is back to pre-war levels of traffic. Visitors this summer will find the landmark Potemkin Stairs and many other prized attractions re-opened after the removal of military blockades.\n\nBut beneath the surface, the war is still undeniably taking its toll. Fewer men are visible on the streets; caught up in the war or hiding from the roving conscription squads trying to enlist them in it. The morale of soldiers, many of whom have served for more than two years with little time off, is in rough shape, those who visit them regularly, tell me. Military cemeteries in cities such as Lviv are bursting at the seams. And firms are struggling to keep operating amid a severe manpower shortage and power cuts.\n\nNationwide, including here in Odesa, attacks on critical infrastructure have been so brutal that much of Ukraine's generating capacity has been destroyed -- leading to outages of several hours a day. Ukrainian-Canadian Bohdan Chomiak, who lives in Kyiv, told me that \"roughly speaking, more than half the day is without power.\"\n\nSome experts are predicting that by the time the first frost arrives later this year, parts of Ukraine could be down to less than four hours a day of power, creating the conditions for a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nTo make matters worse, Russia has reportedly started to attack renewable energy installations such as solar and wind farms.\n\nWhat's next for Ukraine?\n\nLet there be no mistake: The last thing Ukrainians want is for any of their countrymen to live a minute more than necessary under brutal Russian occupation. But I've seen a noticeable shift in the mood of ordinary people, with many telling me that they can't take much more of a war that's claimed the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers and at least 174 civilians in May alone.\n\nBitterness is building up too about the drip, drip, drip approach to providing aid to Ukraine. Had Kyiv been given everything it needed at the start of the war, the argument goes, Russia wouldn't have been able to exploit the delays to seize more territory, build up defenses and repurpose old missiles to target Ukrainian cities.\n\nUkrainians are also realizing that their traditional alliances with Western capitals may not be so solid after voters turned towards far-right parties in the recent European elections. The agonizing five-month wait for US legislators to approve $61 billion in military and other aid for Kyiv should've been a signal for the Zelensky administration that they can also no longer bank on unrestricted American support.\n\nEven more so with the prospect of a return of former US President Donald Trump who, in CNN's presidential debate, made the outrageous claim that he would have the war \"settled\" before Inauguration Day -- doubtfully in Ukraine's favor.\n\nMeanwhile in Washington\n\nThe forecasted record heat won't be the only thing making NATO leaders in Washington break into a sweat.\n\nGrowing questions over President Joe Biden's ability to govern, Trump's strong showing in post-debate polls and the political uncertainty swirling around other alliance leaders in the fallout from the European elections, will make this summit feel more like a painful goodbye gathering than a celebration of NATO unity.\n\nThe clock to November's US election is ticking -- and loudly. NATO members now look certain to agree to Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg's proposal to guarantee at least 40 billion euros in military support each year to Ukraine, \"for as long as necessary\" -- an apparent effort to future-proof Ukraine funding from a Trump presidency.\n\nGiven the high stakes for Ukraine, people here will be watching developments in Washington closely. As one Ukrainian member of parliament, Kira Rudik, leader of the Golos Party, told me: \"The best way of honoring Ukraine's fight for freedom is to allow us to finally win this war.\"\n\nFor more CNN

Premium journalism from across Europe. Tailored to your needs, translated into English.\n\nWestern leaders are becoming increasingly frustrated by China's role in enabling the war in Ukraine. Some have even openly threatened to sanction the country if it continues to provide Russia with the materials it needs to build more weapons.\n\nAnd they are right to focus on China's position of power. Russia is now so dependent on the only major economy still taking the risk to support its regime, that China could effectively force Vladimir Putin to end the conflict.\n\nThe extent of Russia's economic dependence became apparent fairly quickly after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Just a few months later, things were not going to plan.\n\nIn 2023, the Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom sustained a financial loss for the first time in over twenty years. Until then, the company's customs and tax revenues contributed around 10% of the country's budget.\n\nRevenue from oil exports has also decreased. As Western countries have banned Russian oil, the country is forced to sell it for less, absorbing the additional costs of transporting production to the likes of China and India, while mainstream transporters refuse to risk carrying it.\n\nAs for natural gas, geography makes things even worse for Russia. China is the only potential customer large enough to justify a new pipeline to replace the ones which used to deliver to Europe. But given this privileged position, China feels able to demand the gas at a huge discount.\n\nIn this kind of bargaining situation, China has the upper hand.\n\nChina can buy gas from anywhere in the world, but Russia can only sell it (at the volumes it needs) to China. Then there is the question of urgency - Russia needs to finance a war now, while China has no pressing energy need it cannot fulfill.\n\nRussia's dependence on China applies to other sectors of the economy, too.\n\nSince the Chinese yuan was cut off from the global banking system in 2022, it has now accounted for 54% of trades in Russia's stock exchange. If China starts to apply similar sanctions, there is no credible alternative to replace that money.\n\nEven more crucial for the war, China is responsible for around 90% of Russia's import of \"high priority\" dual-use goods - electronic components, radars, sensors - without which it could not build advanced military hardware.\n\nAnd in potential negotiations between China and the West, both have much to gain - and a similar bargaining position to each other.\n\nFor example, China is facing considerable domestic economic problems of its own. One of these stems from industrial overcapacity and the need to find buyers for all the products it manufactures.\n\nBut the US has just imposed a 100% border tax on electric cars from China, and 50% on solar cells. The EU is doing something similar and considering asking Chinese firms to make electric vehicles in Europe, sharing their technology.\n\nTaxing cheap products that could reduce carbon emissions may seem self-defeating, given the urgent need to finance the energy transition. So perhaps the West wants to avoid becoming too dependent on China for the same bargaining reasons that make Russia's current position so weak.\n\nBut the balance is not the same.

He is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and a former spokesperson for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. He is a regular contributor to CNN Opinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nAs Washington prepares to welcome world leaders for a landmark summit commemorating 75 years of NATO, some 5,000 miles away I was having a heart wrenching dinner conversation.\n\nMichael Bociurkiw\n\nChrystia Chudczak\n\n\"My dreams have been shattered,\" a Ukrainian friend, Inna Ivanova, told me at a restaurant tucked away in an obscure corner of Odesa.\n\nA former resident of this southern Ukrainian port city, Inna was visiting family during a break from her job as an accountant in Germany.\n\nUp until Russia's full-scale invasion two years ago, Inna was studying drama with hopes of becoming an actress. But with the frequent air raid sirens and electricity outages, like millions of other Ukrainians, Inna opted for a calmer life elsewhere.\n\nHer turmoil, however, continues.\n\nThis week, 32 NATO allies will be gathering in Washington, DC, amid what they rightly describe as \"the most dangerous security environment since the Cold War.\"\n\nThe overarching message from Ukrainians I've spoken to over the past few weeks, including Inna, is: \"Help us stop this war -- now.\"\n\nAnd indeed, catapulting Ukraine into a winning position should be the key goal of the Washington summit. Failing to push back Russian President Vladimir Putin, a man who only responds to brute force, will only prolong the war and make it more costly for Europe -- especially if many thousands of Ukrainians, unable to heat their homes, seek asylum there this winter.\n\nThe question on everyone's lips\n\nLooming over the summit will be the question of Ukraine's desperately sought NATO membership.\n\nFormer Vice-Prime Minister for the European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told me that if NATO leaders pass up the opportunity to \"signal the irreversibility of Ukraine's membership ... it will be a drastic mistake of the alliance.\"\n\nShe added that it would be a much bigger mistake for the region and the world than the \"mismanaged 2008 Bucharest NATO summit decision,\" which opened the door for Ukraine and Georgia to join the alliance, but with no plan on how to get there. (Critics argued it essentially raised a red flag to Moscow regarding two former Soviet countries but without the benefit of NATO protection.)\n\nConsidering the moves already made by Brussels towards integrating Ukraine and providing it with more predictability, Kyiv could feel that it is pretty much part of the NATO family -- save for the collective protection (known as Article 5) that full membership supposedly brings.\n\nThe Biden administration has talked about the idea of a \"bridge\" to NATO eventual membership for Ukraine, but the alliance has yet to offer Kyiv a concrete timeline. Nonetheless, NATO leaders could give themselves a pass to skirt the membership question by giving Kyiv drastically enhanced capability to repel Putin's aggression, while still providing a solid roadmap for a seat at the alliance table.\n\nThe two faces of Ukraine\n\nAfter more than two years of war, those of us who have stayed recognize newcomers or returnees such as Inna. With each passing air raid siren they anxiously scroll through Telegram channels to assess the threat (cruise missiles and ballistic missiles being the biggest).\n\nBut a brief stroll would present an Odesa that is opening up, looking less and less like a war zone. The port, the engine which powers the local economy as well as a crucial part of the global food supply chain, is back to pre-war levels of traffic. Visitors this summer will find the landmark Potemkin Stairs and many other prized attractions re-opened after the removal of military blockades.\n\nBut beneath the surface, the war is still undeniably taking its toll. Fewer men are visible on the streets; caught up in the war or hiding from the roving conscription squads trying to enlist them in it. The morale of soldiers, many of whom have served for more than two years with little time off, is in rough shape, those who visit them regularly, tell me. Military cemeteries in cities such as Lviv are bursting at the seams. And firms are struggling to keep operating amid a severe manpower shortage and power cuts.\n\nA smouldering building in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa, following a Russian missile strike on June 24.\n\nOleksandr Gimanov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNationwide, including here in Odesa, attacks on critical infrastructure have been so brutal that much of Ukraine's generating capacity has been destroyed -- leading to outages of several hours a day. Ukrainian-Canadian Bohdan Chomiak, who lives in Kyiv, told me that \"roughly speaking, more than half the day is without power.\"\n\nSome experts are predicting that by the time the first frost arrives later this year, parts of Ukraine could be down to less than four hours a day of power, creating the conditions for a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nTo make matters worse, Russia has reportedly started to attack renewable energy installations such as solar and wind farms.\n\nWhat's next for Ukraine?\n\nLet there be no mistake: The last thing Ukrainians want is for any of their countrymen to live a minute more than necessary under brutal Russian occupation. But I've seen a noticeable shift in the mood of ordinary people, with many telling me that they can't take much more of a war that's claimed the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers and at least 174 civilians in May alone.\n\nBitterness is building up too about the drip, drip, drip approach to providing aid to Ukraine. Had Kyiv been given everything it needed at the start of the war, the argument goes, Russia wouldn't have been able to exploit the delays to seize more territory, build up defenses and repurpose old missiles to target Ukrainian cities.\n\nUkrainians are also realizing that their traditional alliances with Western capitals may not be so solid after voters turned towards far-right parties in the recent European elections. The agonizing five-month wait for US legislators to approve $61 billion in military and other aid for Kyiv should've been a signal for the Zelensky administration that they can also no longer bank on unrestricted American support.\n\nEven more so with the prospect of a return of former US President Donald Trump who, in CNN's presidential debate, made the outrageous claim that he would have the war \"settled\" before Inauguration Day -- doubtfully in Ukraine's favor.\n\nMeanwhile in Washington\n\nThe forecasted record heat won't be the only thing making NATO leaders in Washington break into a sweat.\n\nGrowing questions over President Joe Biden's ability to govern, Trump's strong showing in post-debate polls and the political uncertainty swirling around other alliance leaders in the fallout from the European elections, will make this summit feel more like a painful goodbye gathering than a celebration of NATO unity.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter\n\nSign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe clock to November's US election is ticking -- and loudly. NATO members now look certain to agree to Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg's proposal to guarantee at least 40 billion euros in military support each year to Ukraine, \"for as long as necessary\" -- an apparent effort to future-proof Ukraine funding from a Trump presidency.\n\nGiven the high stakes for Ukraine, people here will be watching developments in Washington closely. As one Ukrainian member of parliament, Kira Rudik, leader of the Golos Party, told me: \"The best way of honoring Ukraine's fight for freedom is to allow us to finally win this war.\"", "source":

But with the frequent air raid sirens and electricity outages, like millions of other Ukrainians, Inna opted for a calmer life elsewhere.\n\nHer turmoil, however, continues.\n\nThis week, 32 NATO allies will be gathering in Washington, DC, amid what they rightly describe as \"the most dangerous security environment since the Cold War.\"\n\nThe overarching message from Ukrainians I've spoken to over the past few weeks, including Inna, is: \"Help us stop this war -- now.\"\n\nAnd indeed, catapulting Ukraine into a winning position should be the key goal of the Washington summit. Failing to push back Russian President Vladimir Putin, a man who only responds to brute force, will only prolong the war and make it more costly for Europe -- especially if many thousands of Ukrainians, unable to heat their homes, seek asylum there this winter.\n\nLooming over the summit will be the question of Ukraine's desperately sought NATO membership.\n\nFormer Vice-Prime Minister for the European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze told me that if NATO leaders pass up the opportunity to \"signal the irreversibility of Ukraine's membership ... it will be a drastic mistake of the alliance.\"\n\nShe added that it would be a much bigger mistake for the region and the world than the \"mismanaged 2008 Bucharest NATO summit decision,\" which opened the door for Ukraine and Georgia to join the alliance, but with no plan on how to get there. (Critics argued it essentially raised a red flag to Moscow regarding two former Soviet countries but without the benefit of NATO protection.)\n\nConsidering the moves already made by Brussels towards integrating Ukraine and providing it with more predictability, Kyiv could feel that it is pretty much part of the NATO family -- save for the collective protection (known as Article 5) that full membership supposedly brings.\n\nThe Biden administration has talked about the idea of a \"bridge\" to NATO eventual membership for Ukraine, but the alliance has yet to offer Kyiv a concrete timeline. Nonetheless, NATO leaders could give themselves a pass to skirt the membership question by giving Kyiv drastically enhanced capability to repel Putin's aggression, while still providing a solid roadmap for a seat at the alliance table.\n\nAfter more than two years of war, those of us who have stayed recognize newcomers or returnees such as Inna. With each passing air raid siren they anxiously scroll through Telegram channels to assess the threat (cruise missiles and ballistic missiles being the biggest).\n\nBut a brief stroll would present an Odesa that is opening up, looking less and less like a war zone. The port, the engine which powers the local economy as well as a crucial part of the global food supply chain, is back to pre-war levels of traffic. Visitors this summer will find the landmark Potemkin Stairs and many other prized attractions re-opened after the removal of military blockades.\n\nBut beneath the surface, the war is still undeniably taking its toll. Fewer men are visible on the streets; caught up in the war or hiding from the roving conscription squads trying to enlist them in it. The morale of soldiers, many of whom have served for more than two years with little time off, is in rough shape, those who visit them regularly, tell me. Military cemeteries in cities such as Lviv are bursting at the seams. And firms are struggling to keep operating amid a severe manpower shortage and power cuts.\n\nNationwide, including here in Odesa, attacks on critical infrastructure have been so brutal that much of Ukraine's generating capacity has been destroyed -- leading to outages of several hours a day. Ukrainian-Canadian Bohdan Chomiak, who lives in Kyiv, told me that \"roughly speaking, more than half the day is without power.\"\n\nSome experts are predicting that by the time the first frost arrives later this year, parts of Ukraine could be down to less than four hours a day of power, creating the conditions for a humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nTo make matters worse, Russia has reportedly started to attack renewable energy installations such as solar and wind farms.\n\nLet there be no mistake: The last thing Ukrainians want is for any of their countrymen to live a minute more than necessary under brutal Russian occupation. But I've seen a noticeable shift in the mood of ordinary people, with many telling me that they can't take much more of a war that's claimed the lives of tens of thousands of soldiers and at least 174 civilians in May alone.\n\nBitterness is building up too about the drip, drip, drip approach to providing aid to Ukraine. Had Kyiv been given everything it needed at the start of the war, the argument goes, Russia wouldn't have been able to exploit the delays to seize more territory, build up defenses and repurpose old missiles to target Ukrainian cities.\n\nUkrainians are also realizing that their traditional alliances with Western capitals may not be so solid after voters turned towards far-right parties in the recent European elections. The agonizing five-month wait for US legislators to approve $61 billion in military and other aid for Kyiv should've been a signal for the Zelensky administration that they can also no longer bank on unrestricted American support.\n\nEven more so with the prospect of a return of former US President Donald Trump who, in CNN's presidential debate, made the outrageous claim that he would have the war \"settled\" before Inauguration Day -- doubtfully in Ukraine's favor.\n\nGrowing questions over President Joe Biden's ability to govern, Trump's strong showing in post-debate polls and the political uncertainty swirling around other alliance leaders in the fallout from the European elections, will make this summit feel more like a painful goodbye gathering than a celebration of NATO unity.\n\nThe clock to November's US election is ticking -- and loudly. NATO members now look certain to agree to Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg's proposal to guarantee at least 40 billion euros in military support each year to Ukraine, \"for as long as necessary\" -- an apparent effort to future-proof Ukraine funding from a Trump presidency.\n\nGiven the high stakes for Ukraine, people here will be watching developments in Washington closely. As one Ukrainian member of parliament, Kira Rudik, leader of the Golos Party, told me: \"The best way of honoring Ukraine's fight for freedom is to allow us to finally win this war.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has implied he might cut funding for Ukraine, and Republican Party lawmakers earlier this year held up a bill to provide aid to Ukraine for weeks.\n\nOn the topic of a timeline for Ukraine joining NATO, or lack thereof, Gressel said being in a state of war made any timeline quite difficult to predict.\n\n\"A political invitation with a clause that if conditions are met would be, of course, a stronger signal, but, in practice, Ukraine knows that as long the war is ongoing in the current phase, NATO membership is pretty difficult to achieve,\" Gressel said.\n\nHe added that Ukraine was determining its own path by not becoming a Russian satellite.\n\n\"Ukraine fights for its independence and Ukraine fights for its sovereignty. Ukraine had tried to choose a different path than a Russia satellite for decades,\" Gressel said, adding that NATO membership was being seen as a long-term \"security guarantee that they will not be ever again a Russian satellite.\"\n\nGressel said many Ukrainians were willing to die for such a guarantee: \"They don't die for any particular president or for a political party.

It's a visit that risks annoying India's ally the US. Modi hopes his relationship with Putin will help offset China's power.\n\nWhen India's prime minister arrived in Moscow on Tuesday, he greeted Russia's famously chilly president, Vladimir Putin, with an exuberant bear hug.\n\nIt was a move likely to rile the US, India's most important geopolitical ally, which has placed pressure on New Delhi to loosen its ties with Russia over Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fear of China -- a key Russian ally -- means that he's willing to risk American anger to keep Putin close.\n\n\"New Delhi sees Moscow as an important buffer in their relationship due to Moscow's strong ties with Beijing,\" Sarang Shidore, an analyst at the Quincy Institute, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It is not in Russia's interest to have China and India at loggerheads, so it could, to a degree, act as a restraining agent.\"\n\nIndia ignores US pressure to cut Russia ties\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union was among India's most important allies, with the Kremlin providing military support during India's clashes with Pakistan.\n\nThey've remained close ever since, but the relationship is being tested anew in the fallout from the Ukraine war.\n\nThe US has attempted to persuade India to take part in its campaign to isolate Russia over the Ukraine invasion -- but with little success.\n\n\"Russia is one of India's oldest strategic partners, and New Delhi wants to maintain this relationship regardless of Russia's diplomatic isolation following the war in Ukraine,\" Rahul Bhatia, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, told BI.\n\nIndia has increased its purchase of Russian goods, including oil and fertilizer, at reduced prices after the US imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\nIt continues to buy Russian armaments, with around 70% of its weapons systems believed to be Russian-made, and its military reliant on the Kremlin for spare parts and upgrades.\n\n\"Taking a hardline position against Russia could have both economic and security ramifications for India,\" said Richard Rossow, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nChina's threat to India increases\n\nThe threat from Chinese leader Xi Jinping is another key factor in Modi's determination to ignore US pressure and retain good ties with Putin.\n\nChina's regional might is growing, and it's menacing India, Asia's other major economic power.\n\nIn 2020, a long-simmering border dispute resulted in deadly clashes between Indian and Chinese troops. China has bolstered its presence in the Indian Ocean, and the two are jostling for influence in countries in the region.\n\nChina has built stronger ties with Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, hoping a Russian victory will damage US power and enhance its own global might. And it's this friendship Modi's seeking to drive a wedge between.\n\n\"There is a real chance of future conflicts, and India would prefer to avoid Russia exporting advanced military hardware to China,\" said Rossow.\n\nSome Indian analysts believe that China poses a greater threat to Russia than NATO in the long term and that India can exploit those differences.\n\n\"The Russia-China 'alliance' may be short-term in nature, and that historical conflicts between the two, such as over their long border and under-developed natural resources in Russia's east, will resurface and trigger renewed tensions,\" said Morrow.\n\nBut for the time being, Russia's new \"no limits\" partnership has got Modi worried, and he'll likely be hoping for a swift end to the Ukraine war. By maintaining good relations with Putin he's hoping he can contain the fallout.\n\n\"The war does not at all benefit its interests. The war also opens the door to legitimizing violations of territorial integrity, and endangers a principle that New Delhi has backed strongly,\" said Shidore.\n\nRead the original article on Business

Log in.\n\n\"New Delhi sees Moscow as an important buffer in their relationship due to Moscow's strong ties with Beijing,\" Sarang Shidore, an analyst at the Quincy Institute, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It is not in Russia's interest to have China and India at loggerheads, so it could, to a degree, act as a restraining agent.\"\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union was among India's most important allies, with the Kremlin providing military support during India's clashes with Pakistan.\n\nThey've remained close ever since, but the relationship is being tested anew in the fallout from the Ukraine war.\n\nThe US has attempted to persuade India to take part in its campaign to isolate Russia over the Ukraine invasion -- but with little success.\n\n\"Russia is one of India's oldest strategic partners, and New Delhi wants to maintain this relationship regardless of Russia's diplomatic isolation following the war in Ukraine,\" Rahul Bhatia, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, told BI.\n\nIndia has increased its purchase of Russian goods, including oil and fertilizer, at reduced prices after the US imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\nIt continues to buy Russian armaments, with around 70% of its weapons systems believed to be Russian-made, and its military reliant on the Kremlin for spare parts and upgrades.\n\n\"Taking a hardline position against Russia could have both economic and security ramifications for India,\" said Richard Rossow, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nThe threat from Chinese leader Xi Jinping is another key factor in Modi's determination to ignore US pressure and retain good ties with Putin.\n\nChina's regional might is growing, and it's menacing India, Asia's other major economic power.\n\nIn 2020, a long-simmering border dispute resulted in deadly clashes between Indian and Chinese troops. China has bolstered its presence in the Indian Ocean, and the two are jostling for influence in countries in the region.\n\nChina has built stronger ties with Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, hoping a Russian victory will damage US power and enhance its own global might. And it's this friendship Modi's seeking to drive a wedge between.\n\n\"There is a real chance of future conflicts, and India would prefer to avoid Russia exporting advanced military hardware to China,\" said Rossow.\n\nSome Indian analysts believe that China poses a greater threat to Russia than NATO in the long term and that India can exploit those differences.\n\n\"The Russia-China 'alliance' may be short-term in nature, and that historical conflicts between the two, such as over their long border and under-developed natural resources in Russia's east, will resurface and trigger renewed tensions,\" said Morrow.\n\nBut for the time being, Russia's new \"no limits\" partnership has got Modi worried, and he'll likely be hoping for a swift end to the Ukraine war. By maintaining good relations with Putin he's hoping he can contain the fallout.\n\n\"The war does not at all benefit its interests. The war also opens the door to legitimizing violations of territorial integrity, and endangers a principle that New Delhi has backed strongly,\" said Shidore.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_porter@businessinsider.com", "name": "Tom Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffer state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramount leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center for Strategic and International Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurasia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Isles"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Century", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Century"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_dispute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Territorial dispute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/668d17a2268f62ba18a85240?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717162", "eventUri": "eng-9717162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 97, "relevance": 1}

A statement to this effect is expected at the end of the summit.\n\nWhile every country has a right to choose its allies to protect itself, the expansion of the United States-led NATO, given its recent record in Eastern Europe, will most likely contribute to rather than help de-escalate the tension in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nNATO's expansion is inviting trouble; the last thing the region needs today.\n\nIndonesia, either on its own or through ASEAN, should come out with a strong statement to reject NATO's plan to project its power and influence in any form in this part of the world.\n\nAs a middle power that has stayed true to its nonalignment principle amid the growing tension between the US and China, Indonesia should exert all its diplomatic resources to prevent the Indo-Pacific from turning into a theater of war.\n\nInterestingly, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese decided at the last minute to skip the summit, effectively demoting its significance to Canberra.

Indian leaders view that relationship as essential to a balanced foreign policy and to provide strategic leverage against China.\n\nRussia and India started holding annual summits in 2000. After Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2021 trip to New Delhi, it was Mr Modi's turn to visit Moscow in 2022. But in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine -- which spurred the US and its partners to impose sanctions on the country -- Mr Modi kept deferring his visit.\n\nToday it is apparent that Russia has neither been isolated internationally nor hobbled economically, despite the West's best efforts. So, after narrowly winning a third term last month, Mr Modi announced that he would take his long-delayed trip to Moscow. The objective is not to take Russia's side; on the contrary, at last month's G7 meeting in Italy, Mr Modi embraced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and engaged in bilateral discussions with him. Rather, Mr Modi seeks to affirm India's enduring foreign-policy independence, while reaping the strategic benefits of closer ties with Russia.\n\nIndia's ties with Russia date back to 1971, when India was at its most vulnerable. The Pakistani military was attempting to crush the independence movement in then-East Pakistan -- now Bangladesh -- by any means necessary. Up to 3 million Bangladeshi civilians were slaughtered, some 200,000 women were coerced into rape camps, and about 10 million people fled to India.\n\nFar from pushing back against Pakistan's military dictator, General Yahya Khan, US President Richard Nixon's administration maintained friendly relations with him, in order to advance US interests in Asia.\n\nFaced with such hostility, India's then-prime minister, Indira Gandhi, concluded a friendship treaty with the Kremlin. The pact's security provisions helped to deter China from opening a front against India when Indian forces eventually intervened to help Bangladesh gain independence in a swift, 13-day operation. Nixon's dissatisfaction was obvious: in a show of force aimed at coercing India into limiting its involvement, the US deployed a nuclear-capable naval task force off the southern tip of India. This gunboat diplomacy led India to conduct its first underground nuclear test in 1974; the US responded by imposing technology sanctions on India that remained in place for almost three decades. Meanwhile, the US and China helped Pakistan to build its own nuclear bomb.\n\nToday, India maintains deeper and broader ties with the US than with Russia, but Nixon's China opening still haunts the bilateral relationship. With its decades-long policy of aiding China's economic rise, the US not only created the greatest strategic adversary it has ever faced, but also saddled India with a formidable military foe that is aggressively striving for regional hegemony. One manifestation of this is the Sino-Indian military standoff in the Himalayas, which is now in its fifth year.\n\nThis is a key motivation behind India's efforts to strengthen its relationship with Russia, which India believes can counterbalance China. After all, Russia possesses huge reserves of natural resources, an enormous nuclear arsenal, increasing space prowess, and veto power at the United Nations Security Council. Moreover, Russia and China are natural competitors, with sharply diverging interests in Central Asia, Northeast Asia, and the Arctic, which each country regards as part of its strategic backyard.\n\nEven so, Russia and China have been growing progressively closer in recent years -- and it is largely America's fault. This alliance of convenience threatens not only to accelerate an overstretched America's relative decline, but also to erode Indian security. Already, China has leveraged its position as an economic lifeline for Russia to gain access to advanced Russian military technologies, which were previously sold only to India. In fact, no country is profiting more from the Ukraine war than China.\n\nSomeone must drive a wedge between Russia and China. With the US unwilling to take the lead, it is up to India to convince Russia not to align itself too closely with the People's Republic. Fortunately, this is hardly an unrealistic proposition: though Russia's promise to provide North Korea with immediate military assistance in the case of war is not good news, its new defence pact with China's estranged client does suggest that Mr Putin is willing to chart his own course. The first step for India must be to try to mediate an end to the Ukraine war.\n\nThis would allow the US to focus on bolstering security in the Indo-Pacific, thereby improving Taiwan's chances of survival.\u2009\u00a92024 Project Syndicate\n\nBrahma Chellaney, Professor Emeritus of Strategic Studies at the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research and Fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in

Greater Chinese support for Russia is risky for its already crisis-prone economy, should the West extend sanctions against its banks and companies. And for the first time since mid-2022, in March and April of this year, Chinese exports to Russia fell compared to the same months the year before, reflecting growing caution -- as well as the payment problems faced by Russian importers due to increasing pressure from the U.S.\n\nNotwithstanding such developments, however, we should all be skeptical of Beijing's official would-be pacifist rhetoric. The country's long-running systematic support for Russia indicates an interest in keeping the confrontation going -- and reaping the economic and geopolitical advantages.\n\nAfter all, the war in Europe ties up Western resources and diverts Washington's attention from Beijing's activities in other parts of the world. Russia's dependency on China is already high, and it continues to grow as Chinese companies replace Russia's former Western trade and investment partners.\n\nIn fact, China's relative power vis-\u00e0-vis Russia is increasing with every month of war. As the Russian arms industry's burgeoning weapons and ammunition production generates pseudo-growth, masking an actual economic decline, China's economy -- though also shaken by difficulties -- continues to grow. China is also able to import discounted Russian raw materials, while flooding the country with its consumer goods.\n\nIn addition, Moscow has been gradually allowing more of its latest military technologies to be transferred to China too. While not an outright vassal state, Russia has no choice but to meet Beijing's increasing demands -- whether they concern discounts on energy prices, Chinese presence in Central Asia or support for Chinese hegemonic ambitions in Southern and Eastern Asia.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing wants Moscow to neither completely win nor lose in Ukraine. A Russian victory with Chinese support would strengthen Moscow, yet deeply alienate the West from Beijing. A Russian defeat would destabilize Putin's regime and could trigger its political transformation or even destruction. This, in turn, could lead to reduced access to cheap energy, Russian markets, the Arctic and military-technological secrets for China, as well as the loss of its primary partner in its long-term strategic rivalry with the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "politico.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacifism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dependent territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassal_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vassal state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hegemony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Biochemical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/09/GettyImages-2152641554-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717162", "eventUri": "eng-9717162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 85, "relevance": 1}

Standard", "body": "EXPLOSIONS rang out over the Ukrainian capital and black smoke could be seen rising from the center of Kyiv, AFP journalists reported on Monday, in a rare day-time aerial attack on the city.\n\nThe mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko said fragments of missiles downed by air defense systems had fallen in two central districts of the capital and that emergency services were responding.\n\nThis developed as Chinese President Xi Jinping told visiting Hungarian leader Viktor Orban that world powers should help Russia and Ukraine re-start direct peace talks, state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n\n\"The international community should create conditions and provide assistance for the two sides to resume direct dialogue and negotiations,\" Xi told Orban, adding: \"Only when all major powers exert positive energy rather than negative energy can the dawn of a ceasefire in this conflict appear as soon as possible.\"\n\nOrban, who has recently visited Moscow and Kyiv, said earlier his unannounced trip to the Chinese capital was a \"Peace mission 3.0\".\n\nThe visit comes a day before NATO is due to hold a summit to mark its 75th anniversary, with setbacks in Ukraine set to dominate discussions, and follows Orban's surprise trips to Russia and Ukraine in the past week.\n\nCCTV said Xi and Orban's talks \"focused on in-depth communication on the Ukrainian crisis\".\n\n\"Xi Jinping appreciated Orban's efforts to promote a political solution to the Ukrainian crisis and elaborated on China's views and propositions,\" the broadcaster reported.\n\n\"Xi Jinping stressed that it is in the interests of all parties to cease fire and seek a political solution as soon as possible,\" CCTV said in a readout.\n\n\"The current focus is to abide by the three principles of 'no spillover of the battlefield, no escalation of the war, and no fueling of the flames by all parties' to cool down the situation as soon as possible,\" it added.\n\nMeanwhile, when NATO leaders welcome Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to their summit in Washington this week, they will reaffirm that Kyiv will one day become a member and vow to keep arming its troops.\n\nBut they will not give Zelenskyy what he wants most: a firm invite for his war-torn country to join their nuclear-armed alliance anytime soon.\n\nLast year, NATO's failure to issue Ukraine a clear time frame for membership did not go down well.\n\nZelenskyy unleashed a diplomatic firestorm at NATO's 2023 summit in Lithuania by blasting the alliance's refusal as \"absurd\".\n\nStill, in the end he did not get leaders to budge from saying that an invite would only come \"when allies agree and conditions are met\".\n\nIn Washington, Western officials say they are hoping to avoid another bust-up -- with Zelensky being told clearly there will not be concrete progress.\n\nMultiple diplomats said that NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg set out what was on offer at a meeting with the Ukrainian leader ahead of time.\n\n\"The scene is better prepared now,\" said one NATO diplomat, speaking like others under condition of anonymity.\n\n\"Zelenskyy will have to accept whatever is offered.\"\n\nA smooth summit is particularly important for US President Joe Biden as he struggles to right his reelection campaign after a damaging debate performance.", "source": {"uri":

But they are supportive [of] democracy, and that's why I think Putin will hate both of them,\" he said Tuesday night, speaking from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute, just one block from the White House.\n\n\"He doesn't love America. And he hates Ukraine,\" he said. \"Because he hates democracy.\"\n\nLITHUANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER WARNS PUTIN WATCHING NATO FOR WEAKNESS FOLLOWING CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL BOMBING\n\nZelenskyy's comments were made in response to questions posed by FOX News chief political anchor and executive editor of \"Special Report\" Bret Baier, after a speech he gave urging the U.S. and its NATO allies to act strongly in the face of Russia's continued aggression against Ukraine.\n\nQuestions about the U.S. election and Washington's role in NATO have mounted since Biden and Trump took to the stage last month for their first debate this election cycle. Biden's weak performance and Trump's refusal to answer questions on what U.S. involvement in the alliance would look like, have sparked international concern, particularly as it relates to the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. is the largest supporter of military aid to Kyiv, but Trump has threatened to cut aid to Ukraine should he win, and he has repeatedly championed his relationship with the Russian authoritarian leader.\n\n\"The whole world is looking to November. And truly speaking - Putin awaits November too,\" Zelenskyy said. \"It's time to step out of the shadows, to make strong decisions work, to act and not to wait for November or any other month.\"\n\n\"I hope that if the people of America will elect President Trump, I hope that his policy with Ukraine will not change,\" he added.\n\nNATO APPEARS DIVIDED ON PUSHING BIDEN TO LIFT STRIKE BANS FOR UKRAINIAN OFFENSE\n\nConservative sources have told Fox News Digital that they believe it is unlikely that Trump would pull out of NATO, though concerns remain high that even a diminished presence in the alliance could have devastating effects on European security.\n\n\"I hope that the United States will never go out from NATO,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Otherwise, the world will lose a lot of countries.\"\n\nSecurity officials have warned that even removing U.S. troops from posts in Europe will have serious consequences - a threat Zelenskyy also reiterated Tuesday night, noting that failing to help Kyiv stop Russia in Ukraine will have costly effects on the U.S. in the future.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Putin will never stop [in] Ukraine, and you will see it. If we will not stop him... he will go further, and he will go to the NATO countries,\" Zelenskyy said, referencing countries such as Poland and other former Soviet bloc nations.\n\n\"And after that, the people and the soldiers of the United States will go and will defend these countries,\" he said in reference to commitments the U.S. is held to under Article 5 of the NATO charter, which says an attack on one NATO nation will prompt a response from all NATO nations.\n\n\"It's a tragedy for everybody to lose people, sons and daughters,\" Zelenskyy said. \"That's why I think until the moment Ukraine is strong, all the world pays a low price.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "caitlin_mcfall@foxnews.com", "name": "Caitlin McFall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Baier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bret Baier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Bloc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1024/512/zel.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717162", "eventUri": "eng-9717162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 458407999, "relevance": 2}

Rene Tas said three Russian ships were escorted through the Netherlands' exclusive economic waters extending 200 nautical miles from the country's coast.\n\nTas, who is also Admiral Benelux, or the most senior officer in charge of the combined Dutch and Belgian naval forces, shared images on X that showed two of the ships -- the Russian frigate Neustrashimy and an Altay-class oiler, both assigned to Russia's Baltic Fleet.\n\nTas said the encounter happened over the weekend, when the Dutch navy also was involved in a Greek navy frigate's shoot-down of two drones launched by Yemen's Houthi rebels in the Red Sea.\n\nNATO members surround the Baltic Sea on all sides.

Ukraine's future is in NATO.

Tensions are escalating on the European continent.\"\n\nFor the first time, NATO suggested China's closeness with Russia also represented a threat to transatlantic security.\n\n\"The [People's

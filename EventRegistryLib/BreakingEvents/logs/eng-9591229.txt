Rick Scott, a close Trump ally, joins race to succeed Mitch McConnell as GOP leader", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Florida Sen. Rick Scott said Wednesday that he will run for Senate Republican leader when Mitch McConnell steps down from the post, becoming the third Republican in the race.\n\nSouth Dakota Sen. John Thune, the current No. 2 Republican in the Senate, and Texas Sen. John Cornyn have already announced they are running. McConnell said in February that he would step down from the post after November's election but stay in the Senate.\n\nScott is a close ally of former President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and is likely to win votes from some of Trump's closest allies in the Senate. Scott was one of the first GOP lawmakers to attend Trump's hush money trial in New York, accompanying the former president into the courtroom earlier this month and defending him on television afterward.\n\nAnnouncing his run on Fox News, Scott called himself a \"change agent\" and said he'd spoken with Trump earlier in the day.\n\n\"He said he's excited I'm getting into the race,\" Scott said.\n\nThe Florida senator's close ties to the former president could be an advantage, especially if Trump defeats Joe Biden in the presidential election. But Thune and Cornyn have endorsed Trump as well, after criticizing him in the past over his attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters.\n\nScott also ran for Republican leader in 2022, challenging McConnell at Trump's urging. He won 10 votes out of the 49 in the GOP conference.\n\n\"I think there's a better way to run the Senate,\" Scott said after McConnell announced he would step down from leadership. \"So we'll see what happens.\"\n\nScott and McConnell have been at odds since Scott led Republicans' Senate campaign arm in the 2022 elections and the two had differing approaches. The party came up short that year, failing to win back the majority after Democrats took control in 2021. Scott was openly critical of McConnell and won over a few of his colleagues who also said it was time for new leadership.\n\nRepublican senators haven't chosen a new leader since 2007, when McConnell was elected -- before most current GOP senators took office. Campaigning is already taking place in private and in one-on-one meetings, as the contenders work to persuade their GOP colleagues to back them on a secret ballot. The election will take place in a closed-door conference meeting at some point after the November elections.\n\nScott, a former Florida governor, is also up for reelection this year, facing a challenge from former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.\n\nMucarsel-Powell said after Scott's announcement that \"the stakes just got so much higher\" in the Senate race.\n\n\"There's no line Rick Scott won't cross to further his own extreme agenda,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thune", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Thune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Cornyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States House of Representatives elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Mucarsel-Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debbie Mucarsel-Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secret ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:MmFlZTYyYzktMTc0OS00:MjJhOWY1/landscape/1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9591229", "eventUri": "eng-9591229", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Rick Scott is tossing his hat in the ring to succeed his old rival, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, as head of Republicans in the upper chamber.\n\nScott (R-Fla.), 71, who previously vied unsuccessfully in November 2022 to oust McConnell (R-Ky.), enters the race as an underdog against Minority Whip John Thune (R-SC) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).\n\n\"I believe that our voters want us to use this leadership election to make a choice to upend the status quo in Washington,\" Scott wrote in a letter to his fellow Republicans.\n\n\"If you also believe this to be true and want a leader dedicated to that principle, I would be honored to have the opportunity to earn your support.\"\n\nMcConnell, 82, announced in February that he would step down from the post after the November elections.

McConnell said in February that he would step down from the post after November's election but stay in the Senate.\n\nScott is a close ally of former President Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and is likely to win votes from some of Trump's closest allies in the Senate.

Scott was openly critical of McConnell and won over a few of his colleagues who also said it was time for new leadership.\n\nRepublican senators haven't chosen a new leader since 2007, when McConnell was elected -- before most current GOP senators took office. Campaigning is already taking place in private and in one-on-one meetings, as the contenders work to persuade their GOP colleagues to back them on a secret ballot. The election will take place in a closed-door conference meeting at some point after the November elections.\n\nScott, a former Florida governor, is also up for reelection this year, facing a challenge from former Democratic Rep.

Thune said it is all part of a new stunt for Democrats -- \"their best impersonations of Republicans.\"\n\n\"The architects of the Biden border crisis -- the worst in American history -- suddenly want the American people to know they're on the case. After three-plus years of mismanaging border security, resulting in more than nine million entries through the southern border, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is telegraphing that he may force Senate floor votes related to the border,\" Thune wrote.\n\n\"That's his prerogative as leader, but I don't expect anyone to buy this political theater. For starters, Mr. Biden has authority to take action at the border and to do so today,\" Thune added, noting Biden's executive actions in 2021 that undid every border policy that former President Donald Trump had implemented during his term.\n\nThune said the motivation of Democrats is transparent -- votes -- especially in the precarious Senate races in Montana, Ohio, Nevada and Pennsylvania, all states Dems need to win to maintain their majority in the upper chamber.\n\n\"They aren't motivated by national security. They're concerned about their own political vulnerability. They've recognized, albeit too late, that the chaos of an open border is a political liability,\" Thune wrote.\n\nThune is one of two Republicans to officially announce a bid to replace the retiring McConnell as Senate GOP leader, joining Sen.

John Thune, currently the No. 2 Senate Republican, and Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a former Senate Republican whip, in the race for leader.\n\nSenate Republicans usually hold leadership elections in November, after the general election.\n\nAssuming they maintain that schedule, Scott first has to win his own reelection. He was first elected to the Senate in 2018, when he defeated Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by 0.2 percentage points. Democrats are trying to make this year's race competitive, but Florida's politics have shifted to the right in the last six years and it's considered to be less of a swing state than it used to be. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race as Solid Republican.\n\nAfter chairing the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the 2022 cycle, Scott challenged Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell for leader, earning 10 votes in the closed-door election. In February, McConnell announced his plans to step down from Senate leadership at the end of this Congress.\n\nIn his letter, Scott said Senate Republicans should act more in line with what Republican voters are looking for. He said that Senate Republicans should coordinate more closely with Republicans in the House and lamented that \"the Senate far too often passes legislation that is supported by 100% of the Democrats, and only a quarter of our Republican Conference.\"\n\n\"It's no secret that Republican voters believe we don't fight hard enough for the issues they care about,\" Scott wrote. \"Republican voters believe our country is going down the wrong path and expect us to fight back harder against the destruction Biden and the Democrats are bringing to this country.\"\n\nDemocrats currently have a 51-49 operating majority, which includes three independent senators. But one Democrat, West Virginia's Joe Manchin III, has said he will not seek reelection, and his seat is likely to flip to the GOP in November. If Democrats lose another seat, or if Republicans win the White House, the Senate will be under Republican control next year.\n\nScott said that the next leader should be limited to a six-year term. He also called for following a \"realistic schedule\" for the appropriations process and for bills to go through committee and be subject to a \"robust amendment process.\"\n\nScott highlighted his relationship with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, noting that they've known each other since before either ran for political office. In December, Trump endorsed Scott's reelection this year, and praised him for being \"the only person who has been willing to take on the very destructive super RINO, Mitch McConnell.\"\n\nScott predicted that Trump would return to the White House next year and that Republicans will control both the House and Senate come January.\n\n\u00a92024 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

Rick Scott is running to succeed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as the chamber's Republican leader, making a second go at a job he sought unsuccessfully - and to the frustration of many of his peers - nearly two years ago.\n\nIn a letter to his Republican colleagues, Scott said that he wants to make \"dramatic change\" in the Senate GOP Conference. He predicted that former President Donald Trump will win the November presidential race \"with a mandate\" to govern, and cast himself as a conduit between Trump and the Senate that could help the former president fulfill his agenda.\n\n\"We will have a historic opportunity to solve our country's problems,\" Scott wrote. \"Over the years, the Senate has become the place where change oriented conservative policies come to die, and I believe now is the time to change that.\"\n\nScott, a first-term senator who's up for reelection this year, is likely to face an uphill battle for the leadership job. Two Senate Republican heavyweights, Minority Whip John Thune and former Minority Whip John Cornyn, are already running to succeed McConnell, who's expected to step down from his post this year.\n\nScott has also challenged McConnell before, and lost. He sought to unseat the longtime Republican leader in 2022, but won just 10 votes. Many Republican senators expressed frustration with Scott, who, at the time, served as the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. Despite predictions that the GOP would win control of the Senate that year, Democrats ultimately eked out a narrow majority.\n\nThis time around, Scott is casting his leadership run as a chance to unite Republicans. In his letter to colleagues, he claimed that the Senate GOP has been far too willing to compromise with Democrats, and vowed to put Republicans first, if elected leader in November.\n\n\"We too often take votes that divide us and unite Democrats,\" Scott wrote. \"Republicans all across America want the Republicans they elected to the U.S. Senate to stop caving in to Democrat demands. This is not an unreasonable request or expectation.\"\n\nScott still has to get through his reelection bid. Several Democrats, including former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, are running for the nomination to take him on in November, though early polls show Scott with a competitive edge.\n\nIn a statement, Mucarsel-Powell said that Scott's announcement dramatically raised the stakes of the November election, calling the prospect of him leading the Senate Republican Conference \"a disaster for Americans.\"\n\n\"There's no line Rick Scott won't cross to further his own extreme agenda,\" she said. \"The stakes of this race just got so much higher, but voters are fired up and ready to retire Rick Scott - for working Floridians and for Americans across the country.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thune", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Thune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Cornyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Republican_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senate Republican Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/miami_herald_mcclatchy_975/7388b8e5caea8a3a44b67eb8cad8d1eb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9591229", "eventUri": "eng-9591229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Rick Scott told colleagues in a letter on Wednesday that he is running for Senate Republican leader, aiming to succeed current head Mitch McConnell, who has said he will step down from that role after the November elections.\n\nScott, a 71-year-old party hardliner, signaled in the letter that he would aim to lead the caucus in a path more closely aligned with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who McConnell was at times at odds with.\n\n\"Now is a moment we need dramatic change,\" Scott said in the letter. \"Senate Republican leadership should reflect the views and aspirations of Republican voters. It's no secret that Republican voters believe we don't fight hard enough for the issues they care about.\"\n\nScott, who has represented Florida since 2019, will face off against Sen. John Thune, the current No. 2 Senate Republican, and Sen. John Cornyn, a former whip.\n\nDemocrats currently hold a 51-49 Senate majority, but Republicans have a good shot at retaking control of the chamber in November, when Democrats will be defending multiple seats in states that voted for Trump.\n\nScott mounted an unsuccessful challenge to McConnell for the same role in November 2022.\n\nMcConnell, 82, is the longest-serving party leader in Senate history. In February, following multiple incidents in which he froze up in public after suffering a head injury in a March 2023 fall, he said he was preparing to step down from leadership.\n\nMcConnell played an outsized role in helping Trump cement a 6-3 conservative majority in the Supreme Court, paving the way for landmark rulings cheered by conservatives for ending the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion and expanding gun rights.\n\nThat belied McConnell's sometime personal opposition to Trump - particularly the then-president's conduct ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. McConnell also has spoken out against what he described as a rising tide of isolationism in the Republican Party, and was a vocal backer for more aid for Ukraine.

Earlier this month, he traveled to New York to act as a surrogate for Trump at the former president's criminal trial.\n\nIn his letter to colleagues Wednesday, Scott put Trump front and center.\n\n\"Come January 20, to turn this country around, we will need to work closely with President Trump,\" Scott wrote. \"I have known President Trump since before either of us ran for any political office.

Bush occupied the Oval Office.\n\nTraditionally, these elections are held in November and are done among the conference by secret ballot, including the votes of new and incoming freshmen senators.\n\nDuring the most recent election, which was held in November 2022, Mr. Scott challenged Mr. McConnell for the top spot.\n\nMr. Scott received only 10 votes to Mr. McConnell's 37 votes, with one senator voting present.\n\nThat could be a bad sign for Mr. Scott.\n\nMr. Thune, who currently serves in the No. 2 spot as whip, is favored by some to win the post, as he has close ties to the outgoing Republican leader and could be seen by the caucus as providing continuity in leadership during the next Congress.\n\nEven if he received an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, who holds less sway in the upper chamber than in the lower, it's unclear if Mr. Scott could dramatically increase his vote share over what he received in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thune", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Thune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Cornyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whip (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secret ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

John Thune, currently the No. 2 Senate Republican, and Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a former Senate Republican whip, in the race for leader.\n\nSenate Republicans usually hold leadership elections in November, after the general election.\n\nAssuming they maintain that schedule, Scott first has to win his own reelection. He was first elected to the Senate in 2018, when he defeated Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by 0.2 percentage points. Democrats are trying to make this year's race competitive, but Florida's politics have shifted to the right in the last six years and it's considered to be less of a swing state than it used to be. Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales rates the race as Solid Republican.\n\nAfter chairing the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the 2022 cycle, Scott challenged Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell for leader, earning 10 votes in the closed-door election. In February, McConnell announced his plans to step down from Senate leadership at the end of this Congress.\n\nIn his letter, Scott said Senate Republicans should act more in line with what Republican voters are looking for. He said that Senate Republicans should coordinate more closely with Republicans in the House and lamented that \"the Senate far too often passes legislation that is supported by 100% of the Democrats, and only a quarter of our Republican Conference.\"\n\n\"It's no secret that Republican voters believe we don't fight hard enough for the issues they care about,\" Scott wrote. \"Republican voters believe our country is going down the wrong path and expect us to fight back harder against the destruction Biden and the Democrats are bringing to this country.\"\n\nDemocrats currently have a 51-49 operating majority, which includes three independent senators. But one Democrat, West Virginia's Joe Manchin III, has said he will not seek reelection, and his seat is likely to flip to the GOP in November. If Democrats lose another seat, or if Republicans win the White House, the Senate will be under Republican control next year.\n\nScott said that the next leader should be limited to a six-year term. He also called for following a \"realistic schedule\" for the appropriations process and for bills to go through committee and be subject to a \"robust amendment process.\"\n\nScott highlighted his relationship with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, noting that they've known each other since before either ran for political office. In December, Trump endorsed Scott's reelection this year, and praised him for being \"the only person who has been willing to take on the very destructive super RINO, Mitch McConnell.\"\n\nScott predicted that Trump would return to the White House next year and that Republicans will control both the House and Senate come January.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news",

Scott, a 71-year-old party hardliner, signaled in the letter that he would aim to lead the caucus in a path more closely aligned with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who McConnell was at times at odds with.\n\n\"Now is a moment we need dramatic change,\" Scott said in the letter. \"Senate Republican leadership should reflect the views and aspirations of Republican voters. It's no secret that Republican voters believe we don't fight hard enough for the issues they care about.\" Scott, who has represented Florida since 2019, will face off against Senator John Thune, the current No. 2 Senate Republican, and Senator John Cornyn, a former whip.\n\nDemocrats currently hold a 51-49 Senate majority, but Republicans have a good shot at retaking control of the chamber in November, when Democrats will be defending multiple seats in states that voted for Trump.

In February, following multiple incidents in which he froze up in public after suffering a head injury in a March 2023 fall, he said he was preparing to step down from leadership. McConnell played an outsized role in helping Trump cement a 6-3 conservative majority in the Supreme Court, paving the way for landmark rulings cheered by conservatives for ending the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion and expanding gun rights.\n\nThat belied McConnell's sometime personal opposition to Trump - particularly the then-president's conduct ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. McConnell also has spoken out against what he described as a rising tide of isolationism in the Republican Party, and was a vocal backer for more aid for Ukraine.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thune", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Thune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Cornyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whip (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun politics in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isolationism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_57_14_7140931.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9591229", "eventUri": "eng-9591229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

He cited frustration with the \"status quo\" in his reasoning, urging his colleagues to vote for change.\n\nHe was able to garner 10 votes to McConnell's 37 at the time. \"We had a double-digit vote against the current leader, and that's never happened in the time I've been here,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, had remarked.\n\nFollowing McConnell's surprise announcement, Scott said in a statement, \"I have been very clear and have long believed that we need new leadership in the Senate that represents our voters and the issues we were sent here to fight for.

He would replace the retiring Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, who has served in that role since 2007.\n\nScott begins his letter with the statement that \"the path our nation is going down is not sustainable,\" citing the open border, the national debt, the precarious geopolitical situation abroad, inflation, American dependence on China, the drug overdose crisis, the insolvency of Social Security, and the presence of men in women's sports. Scott highlights his experience turning around failed businesses before becoming governor as proof that he can do likewise with the nation.\n\nAs for the Senate itself, Scott criticizes the current practice of bills being rolled out to the surprise of senators, who are not given the chance to either amend or even review them. At the same time, Scott highlights that the many Senate Republicans will work against their conference and with Democrats to pass many bills and that Republican voters expect their senators to stop \"caving in to Democrat demands.\" Scott likewise hits the current GOP Senate leadership for not representing the issues and priorities of Republican voters, particularly on the weaponization of the Federal government.\n\nScott's letter includes many proposed reforms to the operations of the Republican Senate conference, including giving senators the opportunity to review legislation before voting and greater cooperation with House Republicans. The letter also argues that the Republican Senate Leader should be limited to serving a six-year term, a vision that stands in sharp contrast to the Kentuckian Senator Mitch McConnell's over 17 years as Senate Republican leader.\n\nScott also highlighted the need for the Republican Senate Leader to work with Donald Trump, assuming the former president is re-elected. The Senator stated that \"it is not time to make small adjustments\" and that America needs \"a dramatic sea change to save our country.\"\n\nScott, former chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the GOP body responsible for winning the Senate, challenged McConnell for the leadership in November 2022 following a disappointing midterm election cycle.

A Florida man could be one of Washington's most powerful figures.\n\nAfter months of speculation, Rick Scott has made it official. He wants to be the U.S. Senate Republican leader.\n\nIn February, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longtime Republican leader, announced he would leave the post in November. That means Republicans will get a new standard bearer in the Senate for the first time since 2007.\n\nThat person will have enormous sway over the legislative agenda in Washington -- particularly if Republicans regain control of the chamber. Democrats hold it 51 to 49, but the party faces some tough reelection fights in November.\n\n\"Senate Republican leadership should reflect the views and aspirations of Republican voters,\" Scott wrote in a three-page letter to his Senate colleagues, obtained by the Tampa Bay Times, announcing his candidacy. \"It's no secret that Republican voters believe we don't fight hard enough for the issues they care about.\"\n\nScott went on to write that he believes the Senate should operate with more transparency. He pledged to never make colleagues vote on legislation they didn't have an opportunity to review, and to work closer with House Republicans. He also said the Republican leader position should come with a six-year term limit. Scott, who was first elected in 2018 to the U.S. Senate, has long supported congressional term limits.\n\nThis won't be Scott's first run for GOP leader. He challenged McConnell in 2022, but the Kentucky U.S. senator defeated him handily in that race.", "source": {"uri": "tampabay.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tampa Bay Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Term limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.tampabay.com/resizer/OlrtoHkkxkOPFbi2kWEodTW7HPc=/1200x675/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/HPBQCNS6LIZ36LUNTTFAHDYFLM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9591229", "eventUri": "eng-9591229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Rick Scott announced his pursuit of the GOP Leadership position Wednesday, offering yet another option for the post-Mitch McConnell era, citing a need for \"dramatic change\" in an upper chamber that often doesn't align with the priorities of House Republicans.\n\nWhile Scott got just 10 votes in 2022, he told Fox News host Laura Ingraham why he was running for a second time, and noting that the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee is glad he's running.\n\n\"We need to see change. I talked to (Donald) Trump about this today. He said he's excited I'm getting into the race,\" Scott said.\n\n\"I am a change agent. I was a change agent in business. I did turnarounds. I changed Florida and we're going to change the Senate and we're going to be the Senate that helps Donald Trump get his conservative agenda.\"\n\nScott's desire to lead the caucus has led to Democratic criticism, as one might expect, with suggestions that his bid only increases the stakes of November's Senate race.\n\n\"Self-serving Rick Scott is a danger to Florida families, and as Senate leader, he would be a disaster for Americans,\" said Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. \"We all know if Rick Scott gets elected to Senate leadership, he won't hesitate to push his toxic and out-of-touch agenda to sunset Social Security and Medicare, raise taxes on middle-class families, and force a national abortion ban onto the American people. There's no line Rick Scott won't cross to further his own extreme agenda. The stakes of this race just got so much higher, but voters are fired up and ready to retire Rick Scott - for working Floridians and for Americans across the country.\"\n\n\"A Republican Senate Caucus led by Rick Scott would be a disaster for women and working families in Florida and a disaster for the country,\" said Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried. \"Scott's self-serving agenda has failed Florida, and now he's threatening to take his plans nationwide: he would enact a national abortion ban, slash Social Security and Medicare, and raise taxes on working families while cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy like himself. Florida is ground-zero in the fight for control of the Senate and now the stakes are even higher. Rick Scott's self-serving agenda is wrong for Florida and wrong for America.\"\n\n\"Rick Scott's run for GOP Senate Leader shines a spotlight on what Republicans would do if they gain control of the Senate: sunsetting Medicare and Social Security, raising taxes on working families, and passing a national abortion ban. This deeply unpopular agenda reinforces why voters will fire Scott and protect Democrats' Senate majority in November,\" said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

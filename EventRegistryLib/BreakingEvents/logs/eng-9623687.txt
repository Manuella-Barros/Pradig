He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year \"in combined training and inference AI.\"\n\nBut emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla's procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nBy ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker's receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\n\"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,\" an Nvidia memo from December said. \"In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.\"\n\nA more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk's comment on the first-quarter Tesla call \"conflicts with bookings\" and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also \"conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.\" The email referenced news about Tesla's ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an \"H100 project\" at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory.\n\nThe new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCritics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023.\n\nX and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, \"X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.\" Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot, called Grok, CNBC has learned.\n\nMusk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with \"a rebellious streak\" and a would-be competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI services.\n\nWhile Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk's \"antics\" and \"political rants.\"\n\nTesla's stock price is down 29% this year.\n\nRather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla, Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he's been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network.\n\n\"If somebody doesn't believe Tesla's going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,\" Musk said on the April earnings call. \"We will, and we are.\"\n\nTo get there, he's said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia's GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others.\n\nNvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it's hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers \"are consuming every GPU that's out there,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth.\n\nHuang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to \"allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,\" adding \"why allocate something when the data center's not ready?\"\n\nIn naming customers that are already using Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla.\n\nMusk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies.\n\nAt Tesla, Musk has promised to build a $500 million \"Dojo\" supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a \"super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster\" at the company's factory in Austin, Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles.\n\nAt xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build \"the world's largest GPU cluster\" in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February.\n\nThe memo described a \"Musk mandate\" to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI's Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity.\n\nThe Information previously reported some details of xAI's data center ambitions.\n\nOn May 26, xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk's Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn't disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup.\n\nWhile Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a post on X in January that he'd want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction.\n\n\"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned,\" he said in the post.\n\nTesla's latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company's outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal.\n\nIf he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he \"would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\" He's already doing that at xAI.\n\nMusk's comments at the time rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company's largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki's Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as \"blackmail.\"\n\nJoel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent.\n\n\"When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,\" Fleming said. \"If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.\"\n\nFleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain.\n\n\"That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,\" Fleming said.\n\nMusk hasn't been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies.\n\nFor example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once.\n\nAt xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup.\n\nA former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla's 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, where he was chairman and a top shareholder.\n\nHowever, the person said, redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme, given the scarcity of Nvidia's technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self-driving software and robotics.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lora_kolodny@nbcnewyork.com", "name": "Lora Kolodny", "type": "author",

Musk has an explanation for this move, but this doesn't mean it will be easy to fight mounting criticism regarding his management style. Elon Musk has become extremely unpopular outside his circle of die-hard fans, as he devotes less time to managing Tesla and more to shitposting on X. Many accused Musk of being distracted since he bought Twitter in 2022. Coincidentally, Tesla's share prices have trended lower since the acquisition was announced in April 2022. This irked investors, who started challenging Musk's position as Tesla CEO.\n\nA new scandal is brewing after the recent layoffs controversy and the sudden strategy change at Tesla. A CNBC report claims that the Tesla CEO has told NVIDIA to prioritize shipments of AI processors to X and x.AI ahead of Tesla. CNBC saw emails circulating at Nvidia last December showing that Musk ordered Nvidia to redirect 12,000 of shipped H100 AI chips originally slated for Tesla to X instead. In exchange, an equal number of Nvidia GPUs slated for January and June delivery to X were to be redirected to Tesla.\n\nThe email messages predate the Q1 2024 earnings call when Musk announced that Tesla would invest $10 billion in computing power to train its AI this year. Musk said that he wants Tesla to become the leader in AI and robotics, a plan that requires an AI infrastructure with a huge amount of AI processors from Nvidia.\n\nHowever, the emails obtained by CNBC suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla's procurement to shareholders. The emails circulating among Nvidia staff also highlight discrepancies between Musk's comments during the first-quarter earnings call, chip bookings, and FY 2025 forecasts.\n\nThe new scandal made Tesla investors question whether Musk is fulfilling his duties to Tesla while also managing other companies. Musk and Tesla are embroiled in a series of lawsuits by investors accusing Musk of market manipulation and insider trading. The fact that Tesla faces sales declines and rough waters ahead doesn't help either.\n\nThe GPU controversy shows that Tesla is indeed competing with Musk's other companies, something that wasn't obvious until now. Musk indicated that he wanted more control over Tesla before growing Tesla into a leader in AI and robotics. In a January post, Musk said he \"would prefer to build products outside of Tesla\" if he does not have at least 25% voting control. The statement was characterized as \"blackmail\" by some of Tesla's longtime investors.\n\nThe Nvidia emails seem to show that Musk is already prioritizing GPU shipments toward his other companies. Besides the chips, Musk has also moved employees from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight. At least four other former Tesla employees involved in Autopilot and big data projects at Tesla have also been moved to x.AI.\n\nHowever, in a post on X, Musk denied that his decision to redirect the Nvidia chips to X and x.AI was detrimental to Tesla. On the contrary, the decision ensured that the chips were put to work in time, considering that Tesla's Giga Texas data center was incomplete. If the chips were delivered to Tesla, they would've just sat in a warehouse.\n\nMusk revealed that the new data center's south extension at Giga Texas is almost complete. The building will house 50,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs at full capacity.

New emails from Nvidia senior staff that were shared widely around the company suggest Musk presented an exaggerated picture of just how many chips the automaker would be buying to shareholders, according to CNBC. On top of that, emails show that Musk may have diverted a large shipment of AI processors that were originally intended for Tesla to Twitter.\n\nHere's more on the moves the multi-company CEO is making, from CNBC:\n\nBy ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker's receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\n\"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,\" an Nvidia memo from December said. \"In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.\"\n\nA more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk's comment on the first-quarter Tesla call \"conflicts with bookings\" and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also \"conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.\" The email referenced news about Tesla's ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that head-count reductions could cause further delays with an \"H100 project\" at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory.\n\nThe new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.\n\nThis latest move from Musk plays into critics' ideas that Musk is only a part-time CEO for Tesla since he also has SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, Twitter and the recently launched xAI. The latter two of his companies are deeply intertwined, according to CNBC. Musk has said Twitter has a 25 percent stake in xAI, and the artificial intelligence company - in some capacity - uses Twitter data centers to run some of its training and interface for the large language models behind its chatbot Grok. It's his \"rebellious\" answer to Open AI's ChatGPT.\n\nMusk being distracted by other ventures has really been hurting Tesla, and CNBC says its shareholders should be worried.\n\nThe company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition.

Moreover, Musk diverted a large shipment of AI processors meant for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nTesla shares fell 0.6% at the market open Tuesday.\n\nBy ordering Nvidia to prioritize X over Tesla, Musk delayed the automaker's receipt of over $500 million worth of GPUs by several months, the report says, a delay that could impact the carmaker's efforts to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots, as the supercomputers needed for these projects require the GPUs.\n\n\"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,\" an Nvidia memo from December stated. \"In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.\"\n\nA more recent Nvidia email from late April indicated discrepancies in Musk's statements during Tesla's first-quarter call and his April post about $10 billion in AI spending. The email also highlighted Tesla's significant layoffs and warned that further headcount reductions could delay an \"H100 project\" at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory.\n\nThis information underlines growing tensions between Musk and some frustrated Tesla shareholders, who are concerned about whether Musk is fully committed to the EV giant while managing multiple other companies.\n\nCritics argue that Musk acts as a part-time CEO of Tesla, which generates the majority of his wealth. Alongside Tesla, Musk is the CEO of SpaceX, founder of Neuralink, and The Boring Co., and owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022. He also launched xAI, an AI startup, in 2023.\n\nThe reported concerns come as Tesla grapples with declining sales, partly due to its aging lineup and rising competition. Tesla's reputation in the U.S. has also been affected, as reflected in the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributes some of the decline to Musk's \"antics\" and \"political rants.\"\n\nMusk directed Nvidia to prioritize processor shipments to X, xAI over Tesla - CNBC", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year \"in combined training and inference AI.\"\n\nBut emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla's procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nShares slipped as much as 1% on the news in premarket trading.\n\nBy ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker's receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\n\"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,\" an Nvidia memo from December said. \"In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.\"\n\nA more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk's comment on the first-quarter Tesla call \"conflicts with bookings\" and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also \"conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.\" The email referenced news about Tesla's ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an \"H100 project\" at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory.\n\nThe new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCritics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023.\n\nX and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, \"X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.\" Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot, called Grok, CNBC has learned.\n\nMusk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with \"a rebellious streak\" and a would-be competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI services.\n\nWhile Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk's \"antics\" and \"political rants.\"\n\nTesla's stock price is down 29% this year.\n\nRather than discuss EV sales or the massive restructuring underway at Tesla, Musk has been encouraging investors to focus on future products that he's been promising for years but has yet to deliver. That includes AI software to turn existing cars into self-driving vehicles, dedicated robotaxis that can make money for their owners, and a driverless transportation network.\n\n\"If somebody doesn't believe Tesla's going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,\" Musk said on the April earnings call. \"We will, and we are.\"\n\nTo get there, he's said, Tesla requires plenty of Nvidia's GPUs which are specialized for AI training and workloads. Those chips are in limited supply due to soaring demand from Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and others.\n\nNvidia, now the third-most-valuable company in the world with a $2.8 trillion market cap, has said it's hard to keep up with demand. Between the cloud service providers and the companies developing AI models, customers \"are consuming every GPU that's out there,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in May, after the chipmaker reported its third straight quarter of more than 200% revenue growth.\n\nHuang also said, on an earnings call in February, that Nvidia does its best to \"allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily,\" adding \"why allocate something when the data center's not ready?\"\n\nIn naming customers that are already using Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell platform, Huang mentioned xAI on the May call alongside six of the biggest tech companies on the planet as well as Tesla.\n\nMusk likes to tout his infrastructure spending at both companies.\n\nAt Tesla, Musk has promised to build a $500 million \"Dojo\" supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a \"super dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster\" at the company's factory in Austin, Texas. The technology would potentially help Tesla develop the computer vision and LLMs needed for robots and autonomous vehicles.\n\nAt xAI, which is racing to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others in developing generative AI products, Musk is also seeking to build \"the world's largest GPU cluster\" in North Dakota, with some capacity online in June, according to an internal Nvidia email from February.\n\nThe memo described a \"Musk mandate\" to make all 100,000 chips available to xAI by the end of 2024. It noted that the LLM behind xAI's Grok was relying on Amazon and Oracle cloud infrastructure, with X providing additional data center capacity.\n\nThe Information previously reported some details of xAI's data center ambitions.\n\nOn May 26, xAI said it closed a $6 billion financing round led by many of the same investors who funded Musk's Twitter takeover. The company was incorporated in March 2023, but Tesla didn't disclose its formation at the time, and it was four months later before Musk publicly introduced the startup.\n\nWhile Musk has said for years that Tesla is a leader in AI, he wrote in a post on X in January that he'd want more control over the company before pushing further in that direction.\n\n\"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned,\" he said in the post.\n\nTesla's latest proxy filing indicates Musk has 20.5% of the company's outstanding shares, a figure that includes options awarded to Musk as part of his unprecedented 2018 CEO pay package. A Delaware court has ordered that compensation to be rescinded. Post-trial proceedings are ongoing and subject to appeal.\n\nIf he is unable to reach his desired ownership mark, Musk said in the January post, he \"would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\" He's already doing that at xAI.\n\nMusk's comments at the time rankled some longstanding bulls, including the company's largest retail shareholder, Leo Koguan, and Gerber Kawasaki's Ross Gerber, who characterized his demand as \"blackmail.\"\n\nJoel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group, said that by letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent.\n\n\"When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,\" Fleming said. \"If you owe fiduciary duties to two or more companies that are competing over the same things, you may end up channeling corporate opportunity away from one company to another.\"\n\nFleming, who frequently represents public company investors in shareholder disputes, said that in such situations, other executives would be in the best position to make decisions, while those who are conflicted should abstain.\n\n\"That has not historically been the path that Mr. Musk has chosen for himself,\" Fleming said.\n\nMusk hasn't been shy about intermingling corporate resources among his companies.\n\nFor example, following his buyout of Twitter, Musk enlisted dozens of Autopilot software engineers and other technical and administrative employees from Tesla to help him make sweeping changes at the company. Some employees even work for two Musk companies at once.\n\nAt xAI, Musk has also attracted employees away from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight, and at least four other former Tesla employees who had been involved in Autopilot and big data projects there before joining the startup.\n\nA former Tesla supply chain analyst, who asked not to be named in order to discuss sensitive matters, told CNBC that Musk has always considered his companies as an extension of his persona and believed he can do whatever he wants with them. That includes Tesla's 2016 acquisition of SolarCity, where he was chairman and a top shareholder.\n\nHowever, the person said, redirecting a large shipment of chips from Tesla to X is extreme, given the scarcity of Nvidia's technology. The decision means the automaker willingly gave up precious time that could have been used to build out its supercomputer cluster in Texas or New York and advance the models behind its self-driving software and robotics.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.",

And of course, that didn't happen by accident.\n\nHe amassed his $185 billion fortune by starting, running, and growing successful businesses. Musk helped transform both PayPal (PYPL) and Tesla (TSLA) into the multi-billion-dollar firms they are today. He founded SpaceX and turned it into a multi-billion-dollar space exploration empire.\n\nAnd now he is working on his next potential multi-billion-dollar project...\n\nOne that could be even bigger than PayPal, SpaceX, and Tesla combined... A next-gen \"super app.\"\n\nBack in late 2022, Musk bought the popular social media app Twitter for $44 billion. Since then, he has rebranded it as \"X\" and executed a plethora of modifications.\n\nHe's changed the business' organizational structure, created a new business model, launched new features and introduced new tools.\n\nOf course, the big questions here are: Why did Musk buy Twitter in the first place? And why is he changing it so radically?\n\nWell, it's because Musk wants to turn X into the super app that replaces Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest (PINS), Snapchat (SNAP), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), and others.\n\nIn an internal X meeting just a few months ago, Musk said: \"We're rapidly transforming the company from what it was, Twitter 1.0, to the everything app.\"\n\nHe wants to turn X into a \"single application that encompasses everything.\"\n\nNow, details on this plan are scant. But we do know that Musk wants to integrate payments into X so users can directly link their bank accounts to send money and buy things from each other.\n\nOf course, that sounds a lot like eBay (EBAY) or Amazon... except it would be built right on top of one of the world's most popular social media platforms - one that a lot of us already spend a lot of time on every day.\n\nSuch a platform could dethrone eBay or Amazon and become the world's top online shopping destination.\n\nAnd the potential feels near-limitless. X could get into short videos, shows, maybe even movies, making it a threat to Netflix. Musk could incorporate AI to create content, recommend products, etc.\n\nIn fact, Musk has started his own AI startup, xAI, which many think has the potential to rival ChatGPT. And since X has access to a ton of social data, any integrated AI would likely be very good.\n\nSo, yes, while Musk's vision of turning X into a super app is ambitious, it's also doable.\n\nWe're confident he has the tools, technologies, and resources necessary to create a super app worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nAfter all, this is Elon Musk we're talking about...\n\nThe same man who helped to grow the world's largest digital payments platform at a time when everyone thought internet money was a mere fantasy...\n\nHe created the world's largest space enterprise while everyone was satisfied with NASA.\n\nAnd he guided Tesla to become a leading EV maker when there hadn't really been a successful new auto business in 100 years.\n\nThat's exactly why we think X could be the next super app.\n\nBut, alas, how can you invest in X's transcendence?\n\nYou can't... directly, at least... because Elon Musk took X private when he acquired the company.\n\nBut you can invest in a tiny project... trading for less than $1... that could be a big part of X's transition to super app.\n\nIn fact, this sub-$1 project could be the very currency that powers Musk's new venture.\n\nNow, there are no guarantees - though our research suggests it is a real possibility.\n\nAnd, of course, if that happens... this tiny trade will absolutely soar.\n\nInvest in this explosive project before it blasts off.\n\nP.S.

But every single car, someday, will have to have autonomous capability. It's safer. It's more convenient. It's more fun to drive.\"\n\nThe communication's surfacing comes just as Musk's $56 billion pay package is set to be voted on once again at the upcoming Tesla Shareholder Meeting. Many shareholders want to ratify Musk's massive payout, while others are conflicted with his commitment to the automaker.\n\nThis has led some Tesla and Musk fans to question his commitment to the automaker. With the Shareholder Vote coming soon, Tesla has pulled out all the stops to make sure Musk gets paid, especially as he has threatened to stop growing the company to be \"a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control.\"\n\nMusk said if he cannot get to that ownership point, he \"would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\"\n\nI'd love to hear from you!

and \"correspondence from Nvidia staffers\" that \"Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla's procurement\" of Nvidia's flagship artificial intelligence chip, the H100, diverting \"a sizable shipment of AI processors\" from Tesla to X and xAI.\n\nThat said, apply salt liberally for now - considering Musk's frequent corrections regarding legacy corporate media outlets like Reuters and Business Insider, particularly when they cite anonymous sources in articles about Tesla.\n\nIn April, Musk responded to one of our X posts citing a Reuters headline about Tesla, saying, \"Reuters is lying (again).\"\n\n\"I don't think Business Insider is a real publication,\" Musk told the reporter of the media outlet at last month's VivaTech 2024 Paris Live.\n\nBack to the potentially fake news - CNBC continues:\n\nBy ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker's receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\n\"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X

billion in AI spending also \"conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.\" The email referenced news about Tesla's ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an \"H100 project\" at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory.\n\nThe new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.\n\nMusk has yet to comment on the report as of 1015 ET, or about 45 minutes after CNBC published it.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"},

And of course, that didn't happen by accident.\n\nHe amassed his $185 billion fortune by starting, running, and growing successful businesses. Musk helped transform both PayPal (PYPL) and Tesla (TSLA) into the multi-billion-dollar firms they are today. He founded SpaceX and turned it into a multi-billion-dollar space exploration empire.\n\nAnd now he is working on his next potential multi-billion-dollar project...\n\nOne that could be even bigger than PayPal, SpaceX, and Tesla combined... A next-gen \"super app.\"\n\nEnvisioning a Super App\n\nBack in late 2022, Musk bought the popular social media app Twitter for $44 billion. Since then, he has rebranded it as \"X\" and executed a plethora of modifications.\n\nHe's changed the business' organizational structure, created a new business model, launched new features and introduced new tools.\n\nOf course, the big questions here are: Why did Musk buy Twitter in the first place? And why is he changing it so radically?\n\nWell, it's because Musk wants to turn X into the super app that replaces Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest (PINS), Snapchat (SNAP), Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), and others.\n\nIn an internal X meeting just a few months ago, Musk said: \"We're rapidly transforming the company from what it was, Twitter 1.0, to the everything app.\"\n\nHe wants to turn X into a \"single application that encompasses everything.\"\n\nElon Musk Aims to Dethrone Incumbent Champions\n\nNow, details on this plan are scant. But we do know that Musk wants to integrate payments into X so users can directly link their bank accounts to send money and buy things from each other.\n\nOf course, that sounds a lot like eBay (EBAY) or Amazon... except it would be built right on top of one of the world's most popular social media platforms - one that a lot of us already spend a lot of time on every day.\n\nSuch a platform could dethrone eBay or Amazon and become the world's top online shopping destination.\n\nAnd the potential feels near-limitless. X could get into short videos, shows, maybe even movies, making it a threat to Netflix. Musk could incorporate AI to create content, recommend products, etc.\n\nIn fact, Musk has started his own AI startup, xAI, which many think has the potential to rival ChatGPT. And since X has access to a ton of social data, any integrated AI would likely be very good.\n\nSo, yes, while Musk's vision of turning X into a super app is ambitious, it's also doable.\n\nWe're confident he has the tools, technologies, and resources necessary to create a super app worth hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nThe same man who helped to grow the world's largest digital payments platform at a time when everyone thought internet money was a mere fantasy...\n\nHe created the world's largest space enterprise while everyone was satisfied with NASA.\n\nAnd he guided Tesla to become a leading EV maker when there hadn't really been a successful new auto business in 100 years.\n\nThat's exactly why we think X could be the next super app.\n\nBut, alas, how can you invest in X's transcendence?\n\nYou can't... directly, at least... because Elon Musk took X private when he acquired the company.\n\nBut you can invest in a tiny project... trading for less than $1... that could be a big part of X's transition to super app.\n\nIn fact, this sub-$1 project could be the very currency that powers Musk's new venture.\n\nNow, there are no guarantees - though our research suggests it is a real possibility.\n\nAnd, of course, if that happens... this tiny trade will absolutely soar.\n\nInvest in this explosive project before it blasts off.\n\nOn the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.", "source": {"uri": "markets.businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Markets Insider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PayPal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinterest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinterest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EBay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Social_Enterprise", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Social Enterprise", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/Images/FacebookIcon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623687", "eventUri": "eng-9623687", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

This time, it's high-end H100 GPU clusters from Nvidia. CNBC's Lora Kolodny reports that while Tesla ordered these pricey computers, emails from Nvidia staff show that Musk instead redirected 12,000 GPUs to be delivered to his social media company X.\n\nIt's almost unheard of for a profitable automaker to pivot its business into another sector, but that appears to be the plan at Tesla as Musk continues to say that the electric car company is instead destined to be an AI and robotics firm instead.\n\nDoes Tesla make cars or AI?\n\nThat explains why Musk told investors in April that Tesla had spent $1 billion on GPUs in the first three months of this year, almost as much as it spent on R&D, despite being desperate for new models to add to what is now an old and very limited product lineup that is suffering rapidly declining sales in the US and China.\n\nDespite increasing federal scrutiny here in the US, Tesla has reduced the price of its controversial \"full-self driving\" assist, and the automaker is said to be close to rolling out the feature in China. (Questions remain about how many Chinese Teslas would be able to utilize this feature given that a critical chip was left out of 1.2 million cars built there during the chip shortage.)\n\nPerfecting this driver assist would be very valuable to Tesla, which offers FSD as a monthly subscription as an alternative to a one-off payment. The profit margins for subscription software services vastly outstrip the margins Tesla can make selling physical cars, which dropped to just 5.5 percent for Q1 2024. And Tesla says that massive GPU clusters are needed to develop FSD's software.\n\nIsn't Tesla desperate for Nvidia GPUs?\n\nTesla has been developing its own in-house supercomputer for AI, called Dojo. But Musk has previously said that computer could be redundant if Tesla were able to source more H100s. \"If they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can't because they've got so many customers,\" Musk said during a July 2023 investor day.\n\nWhich makes his decision to have his other companies jump all the more notable. In December, an internal Nvidia memo seen by CNBC said, \"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead. In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.\"\n\nX and the affiliated xAi are developing generative AI products like LLMs.\n\nNot the first time\n\nThis is not the first time that Musk has been accused of diverting resources (and his time) from publicly held Tesla to his other privately owned enterprises. In December 2022, US Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wrote to Tesla asking Tesla to explain whether Musk was diverting Tesla resources to X (then called Twitter):\n\nThis use of Tesla employees raises obvious questions about whether Mr. Musk is appropriating resources from a publicly traded firm, Tesla, to benefit his own private company, Twitter. This, of course, would violate Mr. Musk's legal duty of loyalty to Tesla and trigger questions about the Tesla Board's responsibility to prevent such actions, and may also run afoul other \"anti-tunneling rules that aim to prevent corporate insiders from extracting resources from their firms.\"\n\nMusk giving time meant (and compensated) for by Tesla to SpaceX, X, and his other ventures was also highlighted as a problem by the plaintiffs in a successful lawsuit to overturn a $56 billion stock compensation package.\n\nAnd last summer, the US Department of Justice opened an investigation into whether Musk used Tesla resources to build a mansion for the CEO in Texas; the probe has since expanded to cover behavior stretching back to 2017.\n\nThese latest accusations of misuse of Tesla resources come at a time when Musk is asking shareholders to reapprove what is now a $46 billion stock compensation plan.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_m_gitlin@arstechnica.com", "name": "Jonathan M.

Elon Musk has a new favorite company  --  xAI", "body": "For years, Tesla has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and devoted massive resources toward advancing driver assistance technology, humanoid robots, and data centers. But Elon Musk appears to be prioritizing his own private AI ventures over Tesla, according to a new report from CNBC.\n\nDuring Tesla's first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk told investors that the electric vehicle maker would drastically increase the number of active AI chips, it buys from Nvidia, to 85,000 from 35,000 this year. Musk added in a later tweet that Tesla will spend $10 billion in 2024 \"in combined training and inference AI, the latter being primarily in car.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO's comments \"conflicts with bookings\" and financial forecasts, according to correspondence from Nvidia staffers reviewed by CNBC. Nvidia memos reveal that Musk ordered the chip maker to let his X Corp., formerly Twitter, cut in line ahead of Tesla. He also pushed back more than $500 million in graphics processing units ordered by Tesla by months.\n\n\"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,\" an Nvidia memo from December said, according to CNBC. \"In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.\"\n\nX is closely linked to Musk's AI startup xAI, started last year to compete with OpenAI and recently raised $6 billion. Some of the startups' capacity is used to help train the large language models behind X's Grox chatbot, according to CNBC.\n\nMusk's prioritization of his own ventures is likely to further frustrate his critics, many of whom argue that he is spread too thin across his portfolio, which includes aerospace giant SpaceX, brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling startup The Boring Co. It also highlights Musk's personal gripes with advancing technology at Tesla without having greater control.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is increasingly reliant on AI-based projects to assuage investors' concerns. Morgan Stanley places just a fraction of its price target on Tesla's core auto business, and is projecting that Tesla's \"Dojo\" supercomputer could add $500 billion to its valuation. The automaker is also working on deploying self-driving vehicles, promising a demonstration later this summer, and mass-deployment of its humanoid robots, Optimus.\n\nMusk currently owns 13% of Tesla's outstanding shares, but wants a greater slice of the pie before the company continues to advance its AI goals.\n\n\"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control,\" Musk wrote in January on X. \"Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nBusiness Insider did not review the documents. Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nThe decision to prioritize X comes after Musk said Tesla would double the number of H100s by the end of the year in Tesla's first-quarter earnings call. The chips, which cost upwards of $40,000, power AI technologies like ChatGPT and Anthropic.\n\nThe billionaire also previously said he would grow the EV giant into a \"leader in AI & robotics\" and posted on X that Tesla would spend around $10 billion this year in \"combined training and inference AI.\" Delaying the GPUs could set back Tesla's supercomputer development by months, hindering progress on self-driving cars and robots.\n\nAs it turns out, Musk may have overestimated Tesla's capabilities. An Nvidia email from April said his comment on the first-quarter Tesla call and his post about spending $10 billion on AI \"conflicts with bookings,\" according to the report. The email also referenced Tesla layoffs and said job cuts could further delay an \"H100 project\" at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory, the report said.\n\nMusk previously said in a post on X that he was \"uncomfortable\" expanding the EV company's AI and robotics capabilities without 25% of voting control. He said he would \"prefer to build products outside of Tesla\" until he had that control.\n\nThe diversion of chips from Tesla shows Musk is sticking to his word and highlights the ongoing tension between Musk and shareholders who question his commitment to the EV company.\n\nOne analyst asked Musk during the first-quarter earnings call if the CEO was spread too thin. Musk also owns and is the CTO of X, and serves as the CEO of SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company.\n\nThis leak comes at a critical time, just ahead of Tesla's annual shareholder meeting on June 13th. The news adds pressure as Musk faces an already contentious battle for his proposed $55 billion pay package, with several investment firms advising against it. Earlier this year, a Delaware judge blocked the package, citing concerns about Musk's undue influence over the board because of his close ties to several members.\n\nThe executive pay plan, first approved in 2018, involves a 10-year grant of 12 tranches of stock options that are vested when Tesla hits specific targets. When the company hits each goal, Musk gets stock equal to 1% of outstanding shares. Tesla said it hit all 12 targets as of 2023.\n\nThe carmaker has argued the pay package is necessary to maintain Musk's focus on Tesla. In a series of advertisements and messages to shareholders, Tesla has continued to argue that the plan is critical to Tesla's success and a matter of properly compensating Musk, who doesn't receive a salary.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ana_altchek@businessinsider.com", "name": "Ana Altchek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earnings call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuralink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boring_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Boring Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Companies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Building", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Building", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/665f17661cd3b1779042fcc6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623687", "eventUri": "eng-9623687", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 1889, "textEnd": 1898}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nElon Musk is banking on the robotaxi to save Tesla from its current woes, which are characterized by an anemic demand environment and aggravated by the EV giant's margin-eviscerating price cuts. Yet, in a development that axes Tesla's entire autonomy-related narrative, Elon Musk has apparently diverted thousands of NVIDIA's AI chips to X and xAI, costing Tesla billions of dollars in time value of autonomy-related efforts.\n\nAs per the reporting by CNBC, Elon Musk diverted a \"sizable shipment\" of NVIDIA's GPUs, worth around $500 million, away from Tesla and toward his own artificial intelligence-focused enterprise, xAI, as well as his social media platform, X. A December memo from NVIDIA notes:\n\n\"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead.\"\n\nThe memo goes on to add:\n\n\"In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.\"\n\nIn doing so, Musk likely cost Tesla billions of dollars in time value of autonomy-related efforts. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, during Tesla's Q1 2024 earnings call, Elon Musk announced that Tesla's stash of H100 GPUs will increase from 35,000 units to 85,000 units by the end of the year. Subsequently, Musk noted in a dedicated X post that Tesla would \"spend around $10B this year in combined training and inference AI, the latter being primarily in car.\"\n\nFor additional context, do note that Elon Musk has threatened to walk away from Tesla should his multi-billion-dollar compensation package fail to win shareholder approval. His previous package was voided by the Delaware Court of Chancery for being a product of \"sham negotiations\" with a beholden board.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Elon Musk appears to be focusing his efforts on X and xAI at the apparent expense of Tesla. We reported earlier this week that xAI is about to spend a whopping $9 billion on acquiring around 300,000 units of NVIDIA's B200 GPU, assuming a $30,000 price point for each unit.\n\nAt a time when Tesla's board is already under fire for apparently neglecting its fiduciary duties, today's reporting will only add to the perception of corporate misgovernance at Tesla.\n\nAdditionally, this development also downgrades Tesla's autonomy-related efforts, especially as the company's Form 10-K and 10-Q make no mention of its bespoke Dojo supercomputer, one that Morgan Stanley values at a whopping $600 billion.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rohail_saleem@wccftech.com", "name": "Rohail Saleem", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU_cluster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPU cluster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_Court_of_Chancery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware Court of Chancery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiduciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electronics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Elon-Musk-Tesla.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623687", "eventUri": "eng-9623687", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Moreover, Musk diverted a large shipment of AI processors meant for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nTesla shares fell 0.6% at the market open Tuesday.\n\nBy ordering Nvidia to prioritize X over Tesla, Musk delayed the automaker's receipt of over $500 million worth of GPUs by several months, the report says, a delay that could impact the carmaker's efforts to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots, as the supercomputers needed for these projects require the GPUs.\n\n\"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,\" an Nvidia memo from December stated. \"In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.\"\n\nA more recent Nvidia email from late April indicated discrepancies in Musk's statements during Tesla's first-quarter call and his April post about $10 billion in AI spending. The email also highlighted Tesla's significant layoffs and warned that further headcount reductions could delay an \"H100 project\" at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory.\n\nThis information underlines growing tensions between Musk and some frustrated Tesla shareholders, who are concerned about whether Musk is fully committed to the EV giant while managing multiple other companies.\n\nCritics argue that Musk acts as a part-time CEO of Tesla, which generates the majority of his wealth. Alongside Tesla, Musk is the CEO of SpaceX, founder of Neuralink, and The Boring Co., and owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022. He also launched xAI, an AI startup, in 2023.\n\nThe reported concerns come as Tesla grapples with declining sales, partly due to its aging lineup and rising competition. Tesla's reputation in the U.S. has also been affected, as reflected in the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributes some of the decline to Musk's \"antics\" and \"political rants.\"", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU_cluster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPU cluster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanoid robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuralink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electronics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Special_Needs", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Special Needs", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXNPEK370TT_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623687", "eventUri": "eng-9623687", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

This strategic decision, which has led to delays in Tesla's AI development projects, underscores the complex web of responsibilities Musk juggles across his various ventures.\n\nTesla, under Musk's leadership, has positioned itself as a future leader in AI and robotics, a vision heavily reliant on Nvidia's high-powered AI chips. During Tesla's first-quarter earnings call in April, Musk announced ambitious plans to increase the number of Nvidia H100 processors from 35,000 to 85,000 by year-end. He also indicated a substantial investment of $10 billion in AI infrastructure this year. However, internal communications from Nvidia suggest that these projections were overstated and that Musk has diverted a significant portion of these AI chips to X, delaying Tesla's AI projects.\n\n\"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,\" reads an internal Nvidia memo from December. This reallocation has set back Tesla's receipt of over $500 million worth of GPUs by several months, potentially hindering the development of the supercomputers necessary for autonomous vehicles and robotics.\n\nThe decision has sparked a flurry of concerns among Tesla's investors. The automaker is currently experiencing a slump in sales, exacerbated by an aging vehicle lineup and increasing competition. Additionally, Tesla's reputation has taken a hit in the U.S., partly attributed to Musk's public behavior and political commentary. This reputational damage has contributed to a 29% decline in Tesla's stock price this year.\n\nTesla shareholders have grown increasingly uneasy about Musk's divided attention. Alongside Tesla, Musk serves as CEO of SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, and he also owns X and the AI startup xAI. The interconnectedness of these ventures complicates his ability to focus exclusively on Tesla, leading to accusations of conflicts of interest.\n\nCritics argue that Musk's actions are compromising Tesla's progress in AI and robotics. \"When you have someone like Mr. Musk who is a fiduciary to multiple companies, the law recognizes this creates conflict,\" said Joel Fleming, a securities litigator at Equity Litigation Group. \"By letting his private companies skip ahead of Tesla in procuring critical hardware, Musk is making his conflicts of interest readily apparent.\"\n\nMusk's recent moves include leveraging Tesla resources for his other ventures. Following his acquisition of Twitter, he enlisted Tesla engineers and other personnel to implement significant changes at the social media platform. Similarly, xAI has attracted talent from Tesla, including machine-learning scientist Ethan Knight and several former Tesla employees involved in Autopilot and big data projects.\n\nThe scarcity of Nvidia's GPUs, driven by soaring demand from tech giants like Google, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, further complicates the situation. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted this issue, stating that customers are \"consuming every GPU that's out there.\" This high demand has made it challenging for companies like Tesla to secure the necessary hardware for their AI initiatives.\n\nDespite these challenges, Musk continues to push forward with his vision for AI development at Tesla and xAI. At Tesla, he has promised to build a $500 million \"Dojo\" supercomputer in Buffalo, New York, and a dense, water-cooled supercomputer cluster in Austin, Texas. These projects are crucial for advancing Tesla's computer vision and large language models (LLMs) needed for autonomous vehicles and robots.\n\nAt xAI, Musk aims to create the world's largest GPU cluster in North Dakota, with some capacity expected to be online by June. The startup, which closed a $6 billion financing round in May, is racing to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI and Google in developing generative AI products.", "source": {"uri":

In January, he tweeted that he's \"uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics without having [about] 25 percent voting control,\" infuriating shareholders.\n\nAccording to CNBC, the diversion of resources means that Tesla's AI ambitions could be pushed back by months. And that doesn't bode well, considering the company is already in dire straits, facing a disastrous financial year ahead and hugely hyped driver assistance software that still isn't living up to Musk's immense promises.\n\nThat's pertinent because Musk has bet much of the carmaker on the success of its so-called \"Full Self-Driving\" tech, which heavily relies on hardware like Nvidia's H100 chips, promising the unveiling of a \"robotaxi\" as soon as August.\n\nAn email obtained by CNBC suggests comments Musk made during Tesla's ill-fated first-quarter earnings call this year misconstrued how many chips were ordered and where they were destined. The email also noted that the company's continued layoffs could lead to delays with an existing \"H100 project\" at the EV maker's Texas factory.\n\nIn short, was Musk bluffing and misleading investors by favoring his social media platform and nascent AI startup? Is he jumping ship and abandoning Tesla when it needs him -- and not his antics -- the most?\n\nThe news will likely further anger shareholders who are already fuming over Musk and his board prioritizing the reinstatement of a controversial $56 billion pay package.\n\nTesla is in crisis mode, with share prices down almost 30 percent so far this year. And the outlook is grim, with waning overall demand for EVs and an influx of much cheaper cars from China tightening the screws.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk continues to push the narrative that Tesla is putting AI and what it refers to \"self-driving\" tech first and foremost.\n\n\"If somebody doesn't believe Tesla's going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,\" he told investors during the first quarter earnings call. \"We will, and we are.\"", "source": {"uri": "futurism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Futurism"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advanced driver-assistance system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Autopilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://wp-assets.futurism.com/2024/06/leaked-emails-elon-musk-ai-resources-tesla.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623687", "eventUri": "eng-9623687", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The suit requests that Musk return the profits on the stock sale to the company, as well as attorney fees and other costs to Perry for bringing the suit.\n\nMusk likely knew the weaker sales report was coming at the time of the sale, the suit charges. Tesla reduced its prices in China by as much as 9% on October 24, 2022, starting a string of price cuts that has driven down prices of electric vehicles by Tesla and other automakers in the face of weaker-than-forecast sales.\n\nAnd in April of last year, Musk bragged about the up-to-the-minute sales data that Tesla has, compared to automakers that sell their vehicles to a network of independent dealerships rather than directly to customers.\n\n\"I'm not sure there's any company on earth that has better real-time data than Tesla, except maybe SpaceX Starlink,\" he told investors at that time, referring to one of his other companies.\n\nTesla stock sales funded Twitter purchase\n\nBefore Musk started his efforts to buy social media platform Twitter, now known as X, the billionaire executive rarely sold Tesla shares. Most of the time, his sales were tied to covering tax bills he faced due to the exercise of stock options. And most of those sales were part of a prearranged schedule, so there could be little question as to whether they were based on insider information.\n\nBut from April through December in 2022, Musk sold $22.9 billion worth of Tesla stock in unscheduled sales to help fund his $44 billion purchase of Twitter that year.\n\nHis sales in November and December of 2022, along with the price cuts in China, helped to push down the price of Tesla shares even before the January sales report. His sale on November 4 2022 came at an average price of $208.58, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. His final sales of this group, on December 14, came at an average price that day of $158.37.\n\nBut the January fourth-quarter sales report, which came on a Sunday, sent shares down to $108.10 from $123.18 at the close the previous Friday.\n\nTesla shares soon rebounded, though, and more than doubled during the course of 2023 to close at $248.48. But shares have struggled this year, losing 29% of their value year to date through Monday's close.\n\nThe suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court on Thursday and first reported by Bloomberg. Tesla, which does not have a public relations department, did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as Tesla is seeking shareholder approval to return the stock options to Musk that he was stripped of in a January court decision in Delaware. Two influential advisory firms have urged shareholders to vote against his controversial billion pay package and raised concerns about the CEO's numerous side projects.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_isidore@cnn.com", "name": "Chris Isidore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insider trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_Court_of_Chancery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware Court of Chancery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Salesmanship", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Salesmanship", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Business_to_Business", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Business to Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2151277355.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623687", "eventUri": "eng-9623687", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-04", "dateEnd": "-12-12", "textStart": 355, "textEnd": 381}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-14", "textStart": 2817, "textEnd": 2828}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-10-", "textStart": 548, "textEnd": 558}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He also wrote in a post on X a few days later that Tesla would spend $10 billion this year \"in combined training and inference AI.\"\n\nBut emails written by Nvidia senior staff and widely shared inside the company suggest that Musk presented an exaggerated picture of Tesla's procurement to shareholders. Correspondence from Nvidia staffers also indicates that Musk diverted a sizable shipment of AI processors that had been reserved for Tesla to his social media company X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nShares slipped as much as 1% on the news in premarket trading.\n\nBy ordering Nvidia to let privately held X jump the line ahead of Tesla, Musk pushed back the automaker's receipt of more than $500 million in graphics processing units, or GPUs, by months, likely adding to delays in setting up the supercomputers Tesla says it needs to develop autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\n\"Elon prioritizing X H100 GPU cluster deployment at X versus Tesla by redirecting 12k of shipped H100 GPUs originally slated for Tesla to X instead,\" an Nvidia memo from December said. \"In exchange, original X orders of 12k H100 slated for Jan and June to be redirected to Tesla.\"\n\nA more recent Nvidia email, from late April, said Musk's comment on the first-quarter Tesla call \"conflicts with bookings\" and that his April post on X about $10 billion in AI spending also \"conflicts with bookings and FY 2025 forecasts.\" The email referenced news about Tesla's ongoing, drastic layoffs and warned that headcount reductions could cause further delays with an \"H100 project\" at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory.\n\nThe new information from the emails, read by CNBC, highlights an escalating conflict between Musk and some agitated Tesla shareholders who question whether the billionaire CEO is fulfilling his obligations to Tesla while also running a collection of other companies that require his attention, resources and hefty amounts of capital.\n\nA spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment for this story. Musk and representatives for X and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCritics have said Musk is only a part-time CEO of Tesla, the company responsible for the vast majority of his wealth. Musk is also the CEO of aerospace company SpaceX, the founder of brain-computer interface startup Neuralink and tunneling venture The Boring Co. He also owns X, which he acquired for $44 billion in late 2022, when it was still called Twitter. He launched his AI startup, xAI, in 2023.\n\nX and xAI are tightly intertwined. In a post on X in November, Musk wrote, \"X Corp investors will own 25% of xAI.\" Additionally, xAI uses some capacity in X data centers to run some of its training and inference for the large language models behind its chatbot, called Grok, CNBC has learned.\n\nMusk has pitched Grok, originally named Truth GPT, as a politically incorrect chatbot with \"a rebellious streak\" and a would-be competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI services.\n\nWhile Musk juggles his many ventures, Tesla shareholders have reason for concern. The company is in the midst of a troubling sales decline due in part to its aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition. Its reputation has also suffered in the U.S., according to the Axios Harris Poll 100 survey, which attributed some of the slippage to Musk's \"antics\" and \"political rants.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lora_kolodny@cnbc.com", "name": "Lora Kolodny", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanoid robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative pre-trained transformer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuralink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107412299-17151922372024-05-07t012157z_1611056837_rc2cl7a6d1h9_rtrmadp_0_milken-conference.jpeg?v=1715192263&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623687", "eventUri": "eng-9623687", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Musk exploited his position at Tesla, and he breached his fiduciary duties to Tesla,\" reads the lawsuit, filed by shareholder Michael Perry.\n\nIn early January 2023, Tesla shares plummeted to a two-year low following disappointing sales -- despite Musk promising an \"epic end of year\" and allegedly knowing as early as November that the carmaker wouldn't meet targets.\n\nAs such, Perry is calling for an estimated $3 billion to be returned to Tesla and seeking damages from the company's directors for their \"reckless disregard.\"\n\nThe lawsuit highlights the growing rift between shareholders and the company's leadership. The relationship is already strained, with a shareholder vote next week deciding whether to reinstate Musk's astronomical $56 billion pay package. Plenty of investors have since come forward, urging shareholders to reject the payout.\n\nPerry is tapping judge Kathaleen McCormick, who already has a history of butting heads with the mercurial CEO. It was McCormick who originally voided Musk's pay package, determining that Musk and his board had far too much influence and failed to disclose the terms of his compensation to shareholders.\n\nBy knowingly selling billions of shares weeks before posting disappointing sales numbers, Perry alleges Musk \"breached his fiduciary duties\" to both Tesla and its shareholders.\n\n\"Musk profited from his misconduct and his exploitation of material and adverse inside information,\" Perry's suit argues, pointing out that Musk had said that Tesla was enjoying \"excellent demand\" and was expecting to \"to sell every car we make as far into the future as we can see.\"\n\nMusk's major Tesla share sell-offs -- he unloaded around $22.9 billion worth in 2022 alone -- helped him fund his ill-advised purchase of Twitter, and have already come under plenty of scrutiny.\n\nJust this week, Musk agreed to testify in the Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation into his social media acquisition. The regulator is specifically looking at the Twitter stock he held prior to his purchase, and whether he missed the legal deadline for disclosing these existing standings.\n\nMusk already has a long history of being investigated for possible insider trading.\n\nWhen it comes to Perry's lawsuit against Musk, it remains to be seen whether the CEO's suspiciously timed $7.5 billion dump amounts to insider trading.

The suit requests that Musk return the profits on the stock sale to the company, as well as attorney fees and other costs to Perry for bringing the suit.\n\nMusk likely knew the weaker sales report was coming at the time of the sale, the suit charges. Tesla reduced its prices in China by as much as 9% on October 24, 2022, starting a string of price cuts that has driven down prices of electric vehicles by Tesla and other automakers in the face of weaker-than-forecast sales.\n\nAnd in April of last year, Musk bragged about the up-to-the-minute sales data that Tesla has, compared to automakers that sell their vehicles to a network of independent dealerships rather than directly to customers.\n\n\"I'm not sure there's any company on earth that has better real-time data than Tesla, except maybe SpaceX Starlink,\" he told investors at that time, referring to one of his other companies.\n\nBefore Musk started his efforts to buy social media platform Twitter, now known as X, the billionaire executive rarely sold Tesla shares. Most of the time, his sales were tied to covering tax bills he faced due to the exercise of stock options. And most of those sales were part of a prearranged schedule, so there could be little question as to whether they were based on insider information.\n\nBut from April through December in 2022, Musk sold $22.9 billion worth of Tesla stock in unscheduled sales to help fund his $44 billion purchase of Twitter that year.\n\nHis sales in November and December of 2022, along with the price cuts in China, helped to push down the price of Tesla shares even before the January sales report. His sale on November 4 2022 came at an average price of $208.58, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. His final sales of this group, on December 14, came at an average price that day of $158.37.\n\nBut the January fourth-quarter sales report, which came on a Sunday, sent shares down to $108.10 from $123.18 at the close the previous Friday.\n\nTesla shares soon rebounded, though, and more than doubled during the course of 2023 to close at $248.48. But shares have struggled this year, losing 29% of their value year to date through Monday's close.\n\nThe suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court on Thursday and first reported by Bloomberg. Tesla, which does not have a public relations department, did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as Tesla is seeking shareholder approval to return the stock options to Musk that he was stripped of in a January court decision in Delaware. Two influential advisory firms have urged shareholders to vote against his controversial billion pay package and raised concerns about the CEO's numerous side projects.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.\n\nIn a surprising move, Elon Musk has reportedly instructed Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) to prioritize the delivery of AI chips to his companies, X and xAI, at the expense of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). This decision has caused significant delays in Tesla's receipt of over $500 million of processors, pushing the car company's timeline back by several months.\n\nNvidia has refrained from commenting on the situation, while Tesla's stock experienced a nearly 1% dip in premarket trading following the news. Internal emails from Nvidia revealed Musk's directive and its conflict with previous procurement plans for Tesla.\n\nThe redirected AI chips have led to setbacks in Tesla's efforts to establish supercomputers crucial for developing autonomous vehicles and robots.\n\nThis situation highlights the ongoing conflicts of interest as Musk manages multiple companies simultaneously, raising concerns among Tesla shareholders about his divided attention and its potential impact on the company's performance and strategic goals.\n\nLaunched by Elon Musk in 2023, xAI is an AI startup closely tied to X (formerly Twitter), sharing data center resources and investors.\n\nThe company aims to develop generative AI products and position itself as a competitor to OpenAI. xAI will receive 100,000 Nvidia AI chips by the end of 2024, indicating a significant investment in AI infrastructure.\n\nThe startup has secured $6 billion in financing, supported by investors from Musk's Twitter acquisition. xAI's main product is a chatbot named Grok, which is marketed as a politically incorrect alternative to ChatGPT.\n\nTesla's stock closed at $176.29, down 1.01%, with a market capitalization of $562.224 billion. The stock has decreased by 29.05% year-to-date.\n\nThe company's trailing P/E ratio is 45.11, while the forward P/E is 70.92.

The emails reportedly show Musk directing the chipmaker to prioritize shipments of thousands of artificial intelligence (AI) processors originally reserved for Tesla to two of his other companies, X and xAI. This move has caused delays in Tesla's receipt of these crucial components, potentially impacting the company's AI development goals.\n\nThis news comes amidst Musk's ambitious push to establish Tesla as a leader in the AI and robotics space. Tesla has significantly increased its purchases of Nvidia's flagship AI chip, the H100, aiming to grow its active chip count from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of 2 024. To support this growth, Tesla reportedly allocated a significant portion of its budget to AI training and inference, estimated at $10 billion for the year.\n\nDiverting these chips to X and xAI throws a wrench into Tesla's plans. The delay in receiving over $500 million worth of processors could potentially slow down Tesla's AI development initiatives. This raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the prioritization of Musk's various ventures.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into the implications of this situation:\n\n* Impact on Tesla's AI Development: The delayed arrival of AI chips could hinder Tesla's progress in areas like autonomous driving and other AI-powered features planned for its vehicles. This could lead to delays in the rollout of new features or impact the performance of existing ones.\n\n* Investor Confidence: Tesla's investors might be wary of Musk's leadership if they perceive a lack of focus on Tesla's core business. Diverting resources to other ventures could raise questions about his commitment to Tesla's success.\n\n* Conflict of Interest: Some may question the ethical implications of a CEO prioritizing chip allocation for his other companies over the one he leads. This could raise concerns about Musk's use of his position for personal gain.\n\n* Transparency and Communication: The lack of transparency surrounding the chip allocation decision could further erode investor confidence. Tesla shareholders deserve clear communication regarding the rationale behind this move.\n\nWhile the exact purpose of X and xAI remains unclear, some speculate these companies might be involved in ventures related to Neuralink, another of Musk's ventures focused on brain-computer interfaces.\n\nThe situation warrants further investigation. Here are some key questions that need answers:\n\n* Justification for Chip Diversion: What is the rationale behind prioritizing X and xAI over Tesla for these crucial AI chips?\n\n* Impact on Tesla's Roadmap: How will the delay in receiving the chips affect Tesla's AI development roadmap and the rollout of new features?\n\n* Disclosure and Transparency: Were Tesla shareholders made aware of the potential delays caused by chip allocation to other companies?\n\nOnly time will tell how this situation unfolds. However, one thing is clear: the decision to divert AI chips away from Tesla has raised serious concerns that demand proper explanation and a commitment to Tesla's continued success in the AI race.", "source": {"uri": "tradingview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TradingView"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuralink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain\u2013computer_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain\u2013computer interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://s3.tradingview.com/x/xM7BtK23_big.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623687", "eventUri": "eng-9623687", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Tesla's first-quarter results missed analyst expectations, though Musk said the company would release new models in 2025 that would be more affordable.\n\n\"It started to feel like the fundamentals were becoming detached from reality,\" said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds whose firm sold its entire stake of 65,900 shares - acquired in early 2022 - in the first quarter of the year. \"We think the stock works best when there are auto company fundamentals that justify the stock price.\"\n\nTesla's nearly 14-fold increase in its stock the last five years has conditioned investors to hold on during periods of adversity and accept valuations that are more in line with technology companies than carmakers. This time however, even some of the company's diehard believers have become skeptical that the same kind of expansion lies ahead and think Tesla's shares have become too risky. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nOf the 18 mutual funds tracked by Morningstar that have held Tesla shares since 2019, 10 reduced their positions in the last quarter, with four slashing their stakes by 15% or more, Morningstar data showed. Only five added shares.\n\nThat doesn't mean Wall Street has written off the stock. Nineteen analysts tracked by LSEG now have either a \"buy\" or \"strong buy\" rating on Tesla, up from 17 in February. The average price target among 49 analysts tracked stands at $178.95, about 1.5% more than the stock's closing price on Monday.\n\nOthers see it differently. Ross Gerber, whose Los Angeles-based firm, Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, bought 500,000 shares more than a decade ago, has been selling steadily this year.\n\n\"I think the story is over, is the best way to say it,\" said Gerber, who has whittled his position down to around 300,000 shares.\n\nGerber's complaints range from Tesla's public relations department, which he believes receives insufficient funding, to what Gerber calls Musk's distractions by political and cultural issues.\n\n\"Over the last year and a half, Elon's personal quests based on the way that he sees the world have superseded the interests of Tesla and its shareholders,\" Gerber said.\n\nGerber believes the shares, which closed on Monday at $176.29, are fairly valued at $100, some 40% less than their current value, as long as Musk stays at the helm. He expects to give part of the remainder of his stock to charity to allay the tax consequences of selling, or use them to sell put options, which allows him to raise income without incurring tax penalties.\n\nHIGH VALUATION\n\nNonetheless, Tesla remains the world's most valuable automaker, with a market capitalization of more than $560 billion. By contrast, Toyota, the world's biggest automaker by volume, has a $333.7 billion market cap.\n\nTesla, however, trades at approximately 64 times future earnings, as of Tuesday morning, a multiple that exceeds the valuations of some tech high-fliers. Artificial intelligence darlings Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, for instance, trade at 37.8 and 23.2 times earnings, respectively. Other automakers are valued far more conservatively. General Motors trades at 4.7 and Ford trades at 6.4 forward earnings, while Toyota trades at 10.1.\n\nBullish investors justify Tesla's valuation with a long list of reasons, pointing to its technology and fervent fan base. More recent causes for optimism have been the company's continued push into fully-autonomous driving and in-roads into China.\n\n\"The Street is looking through this painful transition period for the long-term growth story to emerge for Musk & Co, with (self-driving) a key ingredient in that recipe for success,\" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has a $275 price target for the stock.\n\nAmong the most fervent bulls is Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood, who has held Tesla in her ARK Innovation Fund since 2014 and increased her stake in the company by 10% over the first quarter, according to Morningstar data.\n\nArk estimated in April 2022 that Tesla will be worth $2,000 per share by 2027, with a bear case of $1,400 per share, largely due to the roll-out of its proposed robotaxi business. Wood has stood by that price target, buying roughly $100 million worth of new shares in April 2024, while telling CNBC that now \"is not the time to run for the hills.\"\n\nMusk recently announced on social media platform X a \"robotaxi unveil\" on \"8/8,\" presumably meaning August 2024, and he later posted that going \"balls to the wall\" on autonomy was a \"blindingly obvious\" move. Last month, Musk said Tesla \"should be thought of as an AI robotics company,\" not a carmaker.\n\nTesla remains ARK Innovation's top holding, at nearly 12% of the fund's assets. The fund is down nearly 18% year-to-date, compared to a more than 10% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nCritics, however, say self-driving vehicles are a risky bet because the technology faces engineering and regulatory hurdles. In an April report, Deutsche Bank said cracking the code on full driver-less autonomy represents a significant technological, regulatory and operational challenge.\n\nThat's one reason why Graham Tanaka has liquidated the entire Tesla position in his $21.5 million Tanaka Growth Fund over the last six months. The fund owned the stock since around 2011, when it was trading at $2.\n\nInstead, he has been buying shares of Nvidia, confident the chipmaking giant - whose stock has rallied more than 130% this year - will continue benefiting from excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"There's too much risk in Tesla when you've got a great play like Nvidia trading at half the valuation,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by David Randall.

Tesla's first-quarter results missed analyst expectations, though Musk said the company would release new models in 2025 that would be more affordable.\n\n\"It started to feel like the fundamentals were becoming detached from reality,\" said John Belton, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds whose firm sold its entire stake of 65,900 shares - acquired in early 2022 - in the first quarter of the year. \"We think the stock works best when there are auto company fundamentals that justify the stock price.\"\n\nTesla's nearly 14-fold increase in its stock the last five years has conditioned investors to hold on during periods of adversity and accept valuations that are more in line with technology companies than carmakers. This time however, even some of the company's diehard believers have become skeptical that the same kind of expansion lies ahead and think Tesla's shares have become too risky. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nOf the 18 mutual funds tracked by Morningstar that have held Tesla shares since 2019, 10 reduced their positions in the last quarter, with four slashing their stakes by 15% or more, Morningstar data showed. Only five added shares.\n\nThat doesn't mean Wall Street has written off the stock. Nineteen analysts tracked by LSEG now have either a \"buy\" or \"strong buy\" rating on Tesla, up from 17 in February. The average price target among 49 analysts tracked stands at $178.95, about 1.5% more than the stock's closing price on Monday.\n\nOthers see it differently. Ross Gerber, whose Los Angeles-based firm, Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, bought 500,000 shares more than a decade ago, has been selling steadily this year.\n\n\"I think the story is over, is the best way to say it,\" said Gerber, who has whittled his position down to around 300,000 shares.\n\nGerber's complaints range from Tesla's public relations department, which he believes receives insufficient funding, to what Gerber calls Musk's distractions by political and cultural issues.\n\n\"Over the last year and a half, Elon's personal quests based on the way that he sees the world have superseded the interests of Tesla and its shareholders,\" Gerber said.\n\nGerber believes the shares, which closed on Monday at $176.29, are fairly valued at $100, some 40% less than their current value, as long as Musk stays at the helm. He expects to give part of the remainder of his stock to charity to allay the tax consequences of selling, or use them to sell put options, which allows him to raise income without incurring tax penalties.\n\nHIGH VALUATION\n\nNonetheless, Tesla remains the world's most valuable automaker, with a market capitalization of more than $560 billion. By contrast, Toyota, the world's biggest automaker by volume, has a $333.7 billion market cap.\n\nTesla, however, trades at approximately 64 times future earnings, as of Tuesday morning, a multiple that exceeds the valuations of some tech high-fliers. Artificial intelligence darlings Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, for instance, trade at 37.8 and 23.2 times earnings, respectively. Other automakers are valued far more conservatively. General Motors trades at 4.7 and Ford trades at 6.4 forward earnings, while Toyota trades at 10.1.\n\nBullish investors justify Tesla's valuation with a long list of reasons, pointing to its technology and fervent fan base. More recent causes for optimism have been the company's continued push into fully-autonomous driving and in-roads into China.\n\n\"The Street is looking through this painful transition period for the long-term growth story to emerge for Musk & Co, with (self-driving) a key ingredient in that recipe for success,\" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has a $275 price target for the stock.\n\nAmong the most fervent bulls is Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood, who has held Tesla in her ARK Innovation Fund since 2014 and increased her stake in the company by 10% over the first quarter, according to Morningstar data.\n\nArk estimated in April 2022 that Tesla will be worth $2,000 per share by 2027, with a bear case of $1,400 per share, largely due to the roll-out of its proposed robotaxi business. Wood has stood by that price target, buying roughly $100 million worth of new shares in April 2024, while telling CNBC that now \"is not the time to run for the hills.\"\n\nMusk recently announced on social media platform X a \"robotaxi unveil\" on \"8/8,\" presumably meaning August 2024, and he later posted that going \"balls to the wall\" on autonomy was a \"blindingly obvious\" move. Last month, Musk said Tesla \"should be thought of as an AI robotics company,\" not a carmaker.\n\nTesla remains ARK Innovation's top holding, at nearly 12% of the fund's assets. The fund is down nearly 18% year-to-date, compared to a more than 10% gain for the S&P 500.\n\nCritics, however, say self-driving vehicles are a risky bet because the technology faces engineering and regulatory hurdles. In an April report, Deutsche Bank said cracking the code on full driver-less autonomy represents a significant technological, regulatory and operational challenge.\n\nThat's one reason why Graham Tanaka has liquidated the entire Tesla position in his $21.5 million Tanaka Growth Fund over the last six months. The fund owned the stock since around 2011, when it was trading at $2.\n\nInstead, he has been buying shares of Nvidia, confident the chipmaking giant - whose stock has rallied more than 130% this year - will continue benefiting from excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence.\n\n\"There's too much risk in Tesla when you've got a great play like Nvidia trading at half the valuation,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by David Randall.

They are not our saviors, but rather obstacles to a better future for consumers and workers alike.\n\nElon Musk likes to be portrayed as a swashbuckling entrepreneur, a sort of romantic character in an Ayn Rand novel who opens up new enterprises and industries where others fear to tread. But these days, heroism is hard to find in at least one Musk-owned business: sales at Tesla are dropping, the Department of Justice is investigating the company for wire fraud given safety issues with their self-driving vehicles, and Musk is laying off the entire Tesla charging team.\n\nWhy the turn in fortunes? It's easy to lay the blame on particulars: the rise of Chinese EV competitors, the difficulties of opening Tesla's closed charging systems to other brands, and the complexity of making self-propelled autos that are, well, not that well-propelled. But the lesson might be a bit simple for Musk and others wrapped up in their own self-made stories: live by the public will, die by the public will.\n\nAs much as Musk has carefully cultivated an image of himself as a capitalist pioneer, his path has been paved by government largesse. SpaceX relies on federal subsidies, particularly from NASA, while Tesla had long relied on federal and state incentives inducing the broader auto industry to shed its addiction to fossil fuels.\n\nLet's stop focusing just on individual triumph in a world where success has also been greased by public policy and where the future will be determined by public approval.\n\nHis more purely private ventures have been less successful. The PayPal board ousted him as CEO in 2000 -- although he made off with enough stock to fund future adventures. After first making an offer whose dollar figure was seemingly influenced by a marijuana meme, he managed to purchase Twitter in 2022 at a price well above valuation. He then promptly renamed it as \"X\" and seems to be running it into the ground in terms of both finances and reputation.\n\nFrom a respected site used by readers to track instant news coverage -- along with the occasional glimpse at cute puppies, rap feuds, and dance trends -- X has become host to a cesspool of right-wing conspiracy theories, all in the name of \"free speech.\" Earlier this month, Musk brought back onto the site, Nick Fuentes, an acknowledged white supremacist and antisemite whose reentry drew quick condemnation.\n\nHmm... and you wonder why Tesla is losing market share?\n\nCertainly, it's the fact that automakers, both in China and in the U.S., are finally making electric vehicles that are worthy competitors. But it's also the case that the same people who are attracted to sustainability in their mobility options are generally not as enthusiastic about giving neo-fascists a safe place to practice and broadcast hate.\n\nAfter all, Musk portraying himself as a political renegade who touts free speech and aligns himself with white supremacists is not actually a money-making strategy: Republican consumers may applaud that sentiment, but then they also lean away from zero emissions vehicles and lean into purchasing gas-guzzlers that show the planet who's boss. Meanwhile, many of the potential consumers ready to take the leap to buy an EV struggle with Elon's reputation.\n\nAnd it's not just about who he platforms but also who he ignores. Resolutely anti-union, he has resisted efforts to organize Tesla's workforce despite constant complaints about the pace of work and the pay for work. The United Auto Workers, coming off a successful campaign for better contracts with the traditional Big Three automakers, now has Tesla squarely in its sights. The resulting conflicts will make for even worse publicity for a brand -- Musk -- already tarnished.\n\nIt's easy to focus on Musk. But consider Marc Andreessen, a Silicon Valley investor who has been labeled the \"godfather of the web browser\" for his role in creating Netscape. He has attacked \"statism\" as an evil, even as the Internet that he helped make more accessible was actually birthed in the world by federal investments in technology.\n\nMeanwhile, artificial intelligence, an achievement attributed to tech geniuses, basically consists of scraping that same internet for the world's knowledge and regurgitating it for profit. And in keeping with the idea that the commons is key, think of all the private investor interest in the new green economy, an economic shift made possible by social movements -- some born and spread on the internet -- pressing for global climate responsibility.\n\nSo let's stop focusing just on individual triumph in a world where success has also been greased by public policy and where the future will be determined by public approval.

First-quarter results fell short of analyst expectations, prompting CEO Elon Musk to promise new, affordable models by 2025. Institutional investors, sensing the end of Tesla's high-growth phase, are reducing their stakes. A Portfolio Manager at Gabelli Funds entirely offloaded 65,900 shares, while Morningstar data reveals that 10 out of 18 mutual funds cut their Tesla holdings last quarter. Despite these setbacks, 19 analysts from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) still rate Tesla as a 'buy' or 'strong buy', with an average price target slightly above the current market price. Tesla remains the world's most valuable automaker with a market cap over $560 billion.\n\nTesla's current turbulence has jolted the market, causing significant re-evaluation among investors. Institutional investors like Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management have slashed their holdings, citing concerns over Tesla's high valuation and underperformance. Despite trading at about 64 times future earnings, far above peers like General Motors and Ford, Tesla's lofty valuation could become less appealing if growth slows.\n\nThe bigger picture: Global economic shifts on the horizon.\n\nTesla's pivot towards AI and robotics reflects broader industry trends as companies seek new growth avenues. While Tesla's commitment to autonomous driving technology is notable, significant technological and regulatory hurdles remain. Analysts like Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities see potential, setting higher price targets based on long-term innovations.

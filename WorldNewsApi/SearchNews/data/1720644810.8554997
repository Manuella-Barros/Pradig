Community leader Hering died May 11 at age 97. Born Oct. 17, 1930, she was a 1947 graduate of Westminster High School. She also earned a degree at Western Maryland College (now McDaniel College) in 1951. According to a tribute on May 17 by Pastor Malcolm Stranathan, Hering \u201ctaught grades six through twelve at Taneytown High School where she had begun teaching \u2013 fresh out of college \u2013 and continued for five years. Later, while raising her family, she worked regularly as a substitute teacher at West Middle School in Westminster. \u201cJackie was a long-time member of Westminster United Methodist Church since 1942. She was dedicated to her faith and served within her church community in various capacities including co-president of the Myriam Circle, and was a Sunday School Teacher,\u201d according to information found in her obituary. One of the many little-known facts about Hering is that she worked at a top-secret defense facility at Western Maryland College during the Cold War. Today, it can be known that Hering could really \u201ckeep a secret.\u201d Hering was a member of a distinguished group of leaders now known as the Ladies of Lewis, \u201ca classified group of women responsible for sending and receiving coded messages between federal agencies in the event of a cataclysmic attack \u2013 in the basement of Lewis Hall at Western Md College,\u201d according to her obituary. According to information disclosed at a Dec. 14, 2021, presentation of the General Federation of Women\u2019s Clubs of Westminster, Hering, along with Betty Mathias and the late Jeanne Herr, \u201cwere some of the ladies who were given top security clearance to work with secret codes. \u2026 In case of a national emergency, some national officials would need to be housed in the basement of Lewis Hall, and these ladies with their secret codes would be needed for communication. They went to the basement to practice these codes 2 days a month for many years. Not even their families knew what they were really doing.\u201d On March 15, 2022, Joyce Muller, editor of the McDaniel alumni magazine The Hill, interviewed Hering for the Historical Society of Carroll County at Grace Lutheran Church. The article explained, \u201cThe threat of atomic annihilation during the Cold War drove the U.S. government to develop a national continuity plan. Hering \u2026 was among those hired and trained to work in this top-secret government facility that operated for more than 30 years.\u201d The facility and its operation was declassified in the year 2000. Hering was a charter member of the Junior Woman\u2019s Club of Westminster. She served as president from 1955-57 and joined the Woman\u2019s Club of Westminster and was its president from 1976-78. Marjorie Lohnes, who at the time was serving as the co-president of the Woman\u2019s Club of Westminster, said, \u201cGFWC was an important part of Jackie\u2019s life for 72 years\u2026\u201d In 1976 Hering was \u201chighly instrumental in the renovation of Belle Grove Square\u2026\u201d Hering\u2019s love of reading led her to help chair the popular annual General Federation of Women\u2019s Club\u2019s Dr. Seuss Days program in Carroll County Public Schools. The program began in 1998 and featured local members of the community, including this writer, visiting various Carroll County schools on the anniversary of Dr. Seuss\u2019 March 2 birthday and reading Dr. Seuss books. An article in the Westminster Eagle on March 11, 2009, reported, \u201cMore than 1,500 county \u2026 students in more than 80 classes received a personal story book \u2026 in honor of Dr. Seuss\u2019 105th birthday. \u2026 The event, organized locally by the Woman\u2019s Club, promotes literacy and helps introduce young readers to the joy of reading. \u2026 According to Jackie Hering, education department chairperson of the Woman\u2019s Club of Westminster \u2026 \u2018It\u2019s wonderful to see the children\u2019s faces light up when you sit down to read to them.\u2019\u201d Faith Faith \u201cwas important to Hering, according to Stranathan. \u201cShe\u2019d want you to live your life for others and also see that there is value in serving through civic duties and community organizations that advocate for the benefit of the community. She valued and loved her family and Jackie was loyal to her friends,\u201d he said. Many agreed with Lohnes when she said on May 17, \u201cJackie was the consummate club woman. She was dedicated and hardworking. She was the backbone and champion of our work in the area of education, learning, and supporting children and youth. Jackie made a difference to our community and to each of us who knew her as a fellow club member. She will always be remembered for her dedication, hard work and determination. She was a faithful servant who did her job well.\u201d Kevin Dayhoff writes from Westminster. His Time Flies column appears every Sunday.

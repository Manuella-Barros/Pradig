Teenagers slumped over one another on European streets, warbling nonsense into the night sky through tears, sweat and kebabs. School leavers soaked in fluorescent paint, doing shots of some obscure spirit that\u2019s probably illegal in the UK. And university students waking up poolside with their jelly sandals still strapped on, their bodies burning in the scorching afternoon sun. With this in mind, the prospect of planning a group trip when you\u2019re over the age of 25 might seem bizarre. By this point, people tend to have serious partners. Proper jobs. And possibly even a child or two. Nobody has time for a silly little holiday with their friends. At least, this was how I felt in the middle of 2022 when, following a breakup, I found myself looking out at an entirely blank, and consequently rather bleak, summer. It wasn\u2019t that people didn\u2019t want to go away together \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m gagging to drink ros\u00e9 and talk s*** for seven hours by a pool,\u201d said one friend with a three-year-old \u2013 but few had the time, money or energy, let alone all three.", "summary": "<p>Group holidays are for kids, right?

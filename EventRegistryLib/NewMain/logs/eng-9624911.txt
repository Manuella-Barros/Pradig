There have been rumblings about a movie continuation for Peaky Blinders for years, but Netflix has finally made things official. On Tuesday, Netflix confirmed that it had given the green light to the Peaky Blinders film, with freshly minted Academy Award winner Cillian Murphy returning to star as Tommy Shelby.\n\nThere are few details available for the upcoming Peaky Blinders movie, especially when it comes to the film's plot. Knight has said previously that the film could take place during World War II, but there's been no word as to whether or not that is still the case. The cast hasn't been revealed either, save for Murphy's return. Production is slated to begin later this year.\n\nIn addition to starring in the film, Murphy will act as one of the producers for the new Peaky Blinders title. Heart of Stone helmer Tom Harper is set to direct, reuniting with the Peaky Blinders team more than a decade after directing several episodes of the show's first season. Series creator Steven Knight penned the script for the film and will produce.\n\nProducing alongside Murphy and Knight are Caryn Mandabach and Guy Heeley. Executive producers include Harper, David Kosse, Jamie Glazebrook, Andrew Warren, and David Mason.\n\n\"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me,\" Murphy told Deadline. \"It is very gratifying to be recollaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders.

Netflix has greenlit a feature film that will star Oscar winner Cillian Murphy in a return to the iconic role of the Birmingham clan's leader Tommy Shelby.\n\nTom Harper (Heart of Stone, The Aeronauts, War & Peace) is directing the untitled film. Harper is no stranger to Peaky, having helmed the back half of Season 1.\n\nProduction is set to begin later this year from a script by Peaky creator Steven Knight. Producers are Caryn Mandabach, Knight, Murphy and Guy Heeley. Exec producers include Harper, David Kosse, Jamie Glazebrook, Andrew Warren and David Mason. The feature will be made in association with BBC Film.\n\nKnight told Birmingham World in March that the movie was going forward with Murphy aboard; he also previously told Deadline a movie was going to happen. Still, this is the first official confirmation with a studio greenlight.\n\nPlot details and further casting are being kept under wraps, although Knight has previously told Deadline a movie story would be set during World War II.\n\nToday, Murphy told Deadline, \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me. ...

Full-on Peaky Blinders at war.\"\n\nA global phenomenon, Peaky began airing in 2013 on BBC Two in the UK, with Netflix joining the fray in 2014. The series made the jump from BBC Two to BBC One in 2019 after its fourth season had won the BAFTA for Best Drama. In total, the show ran for six seasons, culminating in 2022.\n\nAt the time, Murphy's Tommy settled many a score, including killing off his cousin Michael (Finn Cole), and rode off into the sunset on a white steed after handing the reins of the family business to sister Ada (Sophie Rundle).\n\nPrior to winning the Best Actor Academy Award for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer in March, the busy Murphy starred in and produced Small Things Like These, which opened this year's Berlin Film Festival. Concurrently, he launched his production company Big Things Films with Alan Moloney. He is currently shooting Steve, based on the book Shy by Max Porter which Murphy and Moloney are producing under Big Things for Netflix.\n\nHe also recently signed on for Blood Runs Coal, based on Mark A Bradley's book about the murders of union leader Joseph Yablonski, which Oppenheimer studio Universal preemptively acquired.\n\nMurphy is repped by CAA, Lou Coulson Associates, David Weber and

Producers are Caryn Mandabach, Knight, Murphy and Guy Heeley. Exec producers include Harper, David Kosse, Jamie Glazebrook, Andrew Warren and David Mason. The feature will be made in association with BBC Film.\n\nKnight told Birmingham World in March that the movie was going forward with Murphy aboard; he also previously told Deadline a movie was going to happen. Still, this is the first official confirmation with a studio greenlight.\n\nPlot details and further casting are being kept under wraps, although Knight has previously told Deadline a movie story would be set during World War II.\n\nToday, Murphy told Deadline, \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me. ...

The series made the jump from BBC Two to BBC One in 2019 after its fourth season had won the BAFTA for Best Drama. In total, the show ran for six seasons, culminating in 2022.\n\nAt the time, Murphy's Tommy settled many a score, including killing off his cousin Michael (Finn Cole), and rode off into the sunset on a white steed after handing the reins of the family business to sister Ada (Sophie Rundle).\n\nPrior to winning the Best Actor Academy Award for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer in March, the busy Murphy starred in and produced Small Things Like These, which opened this year's Berlin Film Festival. Concurrently, he launched his production company Big Things Films with Alan Moloney. He is currently shooting Steve, based on the book Shy by Max Porter which Murphy and Moloney are producing under Big Things for Netflix.\n\nHe also recently signed on for Blood Runs Coal, based on Mark A Bradley's book about the murders of union leader Joseph Yablonski, which Oppenheimer studio Universal preemptively acquired.\n\nMurphy is repped by CAA, Lou Coulson Associates, David Weber and

Fans had cautiously rejoiced, although no official word had been released from any production house associated with the project. Now, according to Deadline, Netflix has officially greenlit the Peaky Blinders feature film, bringing back Murphy as the clan's fearless leader.\n\nWhen we last left the Peaky Blinders crew, Murphy's Tommy had seemingly settled his scores, having killed off his cousin Michael (Finn Cole). After handing over the family business to sister Ada (Sophie Rundle), Tommy had ridden off into the sunset on a white steed in what had been the perfect ending.\n\nBut not for long. \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me,\" said Murphy in conversation with the publication. With a nod to the devoted Peaky Blinders fandom, Murphy added, \"It is very gratifying to be re-collaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders. This is one for the fans.\"\n\nThere has been no further word on either the casting or the plot of the as yet untitled film, but with Murphy back in the lead and Peaky Blinders creator Knight working on the script, fans can be prepared to be dazzled yet again. Earlier, Knight had told Deadline that the upcoming film would be set in World War II. \"I'm genuinely thrilled that this movie is about to happen,\" said Knight. \"It will be an explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story. No holds barred. Full-on Peaky Blinders at war.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tom Harper (Heart of Stone, The Aeronauts, War & Peace) will be directing the untitled film. Harper is well-versed in the Peaky Blinders universe, having previously headed the second half of Season 1. \"When I first directed Peaky Blinders over 10 years ago, we didn't know what the series would become, but we did know that there was something in the alchemy of the cast and the writing that felt explosive,\" remarked Harper.\n\n\"Peaky has always been a story about family -- and so it's incredibly exciting to be reuniting with Steve and Cillian to bring the movie to audiences across the world on Netflix.\"\n\nThe publication reported that production is set to begin later this year, made in association with BBC Film. Producers Caryn Mandabach, Knight, Murphy and Guy Heeley will helm the project, and executive producers will include Harper, David Kosse, Jamie Glazebrook, Andrew Warren and David Mason.\n\nThe show initially aired in 2013 on BBC Two in the UK, with Netflix coming aboard the following year in 2014. As the series grew in popularity, Peaky Blinders moved from BBC Two to BBC One in 2019 after its fourth season had won the BAFTA for Best Drama.

It's a standout project in his career, but the actor has kept busy with other movies and shows, too. An obvious example of his recent work is last year's Oppenheimer, which resulted in the actor walking away with an Oscar win for Actor in a Leading Role.

Following the conclusion of the original show a few years back, it's said the series' universe could continue in the form of two spinoffs: one set in 20th-century Boston and one focused on Polly Gray.

This highly anticipated news follows years of speculation and hints, finally giving Peaky Blinders enthusiasts a reason to rejoice.\n\nTom Harper, known for his work on Heart of Stone, The Aeronauts, and War & Peace, will direct the untitled film. Harper is no stranger to the Peaky Blinders world, having directed the latter half of Season 1. Production is set to begin later this year, based on a script by series creator Steven Knight.\n\nIn March, Knight told Birmingham World that the movie was moving forward with Murphy onboard. While he had previously hinted at a film in interviews, this marks the first official confirmation from a studio. Although plot details and further casting remain under wraps, Knight has hinted that the story will be set during World War II, promising a new and intense chapter in the Shelby saga.\n\nMurphy expressed his excitement, stating, \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me. It is very gratifying to be re-collaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders. This is one for the fans.\" Harper shared similar sentiments, reflecting on his initial work with the series. He said, \"When I first directed Peaky Blinders over 10 years ago, we didn't know what the series would become, but we did know that there was something in the alchemy of the cast and the writing that felt explosive. Peaky has always been a story about family -- and so it's incredibly exciting to be reuniting with Steve and Cillian to bring the movie to audiences across the world on Netflix.\"\n\nKnight added his enthusiasm, saying, \"I'm genuinely thrilled that this movie is about to happen. It will be an explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story. No holds barred. Full-on Peaky Blinders at war.\"\n\nPeaky Blinders first aired in 2013 on BBC Two in the UK, with Netflix picking up international streaming rights in 2014. The show moved to BBC One in 2019, following its BAFTA win for Best Drama after Season 4. Over its six-season run, which concluded in 2022, Peaky Blinders became a global phenomenon, renowned for its exceptionally stylish portrayal of the Shelby family's criminal exploits.\n\nThe series finale saw Tommy Shelby settling many scores, including the dramatic demise of his cousin Michael (Finn Cole), and ultimately riding off into the sunset on a white steed after entrusting the family business to his sister Ada (Sophie Rundle).

Peaky Blinders at war'", "body": "Cillian Murphy will be back as Tommy Shelby in a Peaky Blinders film on Netflix, creator Steven Knight has finally confirmed.\n\nTwo years after series 6 ended in 2022 - and after plenty of speculation from fans - the writer has teased an \"explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story\".\n\nThe story started in 2013 with the first ever series, and starred the likes of Tom Hardy, Helen McCrory, Stephen Graham, and Anya Taylor Joy. But, of course, all eyes were on Cillian's blistering performance as Tommy Shelby.\n\nCillian has since won an Oscar for his role in the film Oppenheimer, so it was never a given that he'd return as the gang leader. So understandably, fans \"can't wait to watch\".\n\nHere's everything we know so far about the Peaky Blinders film on Netflix.\n\nYes, there is a Peaky Blinders film coming to our screens very soon - and it will be on Netflix. Even better, it will star Cillian Murphy as Tommy Shelby.\n\nWriter and creator Steven Knight said in a statement: \"I'm genuinely thrilled that this movie is about to happen. It will be an explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story. No holds barred. Full on Peaky Blinders at war.\"\n\nMeanwhile, director Tom Harper added: \"When I first directed Peaky Blinders over 10 years ago, we didn't know what the series would become. But, we did know that there was something in the alchemy of the cast and the writing that felt explosive.\n\n\"Peaky has always been a story about family - and so it's incredibly exciting to be reuniting with Steve and Cillian to bring the movie to audiences across the world on Netflix.\"\n\nThe film will go into production this year (2024), so won't be released until 2025 at the earliest.\n\nHowever, it will air for free on Netflix for subscribers.\n\nThe plot is currently being kept under wraps. However, we know that it will be directed by Tom Harper. He previously directed episodes of series 1 in 2013.\n\nPrevious reports hinted that the action would take place in WWII.\n\nSeven Knight has said that he wants the film to deal with the Second World War. He spoke to the Radio Times about his film plans, saying: \"I know what's going to happen in those stories and it's about a sort of untold story that happened in the Second World War, which Peakys are going to be involved in.\"\n\nOf course, fans of the show will know that Tommy fought in WWI and was plagued with PTSD, and nightmares about his time in battle.\n\nCillian Murphy will reprise his role as Tommy Shelby in the Peaky Blinders film.\n\nHe said in the statement: \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me... It is very gratifying to be re-collaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders. This is one for the fans.\"\n\nAs yet, no other cast members have been announced. Although we'd be very surprised if the rest of the Shelby family didn't return to.\n\nFans will know that Paul Anderson played Arthur, Sophie Rundle starred as Ada, and Conrad Khan joined the cast of series 6 as Tommy's son Duke. Many of the other family members didn't survive the six series...\n\nUnsurprisingly, Peaky Blinder fans were thrilled to hear the news of the upcoming film.\n\nOne wrote: \"Amazing... Can't wait to watch!\"\n\nAnother said: \"YESSSSSS! The king is back! Can't wait to see Cillian Murphy reprise his iconic role as Tommy Shelby in the Peaky Blinders film - it's going to be EPIC!\"\n\nA third added: \"So stoked for this!\"\n\n\"Tommy Shelby always has a way of making us glued to our screen.

No holds barred. Full-on Peaky Blinders at war.\"\n\nHarper also shared a few words on the Peaky Blinders movie: \"When I first directed Peaky Blinders over 10 years ago, we didn't know what the series would become, but we did know that there was something in the alchemy of the cast and the writing that felt explosive. Peaky has always been a story about family -- and so it's incredibly exciting to be reuniting with Steve and Cillian to bring the movie to audiences across the world on Netflix.\"\n\nMurphy starred in the Peaky Blinders TV series from its beginning in 2013 to the end of its sixth and final season in 2022. It's a standout project in his career, but the actor has kept busy with other movies and shows, too. An obvious example of his recent work is last year's Oppenheimer, which resulted in the actor walking away with an Oscar win for Actor in a Leading Role. He's also gearing up to work on the long-in-development movie sequel, 28 Years Later, as both an actor and executive producer.\n\nMeanwhile, Peaky Blinders is reportedly set to continue in more ways than one. Following the conclusion of the original show a few years back, it's said the series' universe could continue in the form of two spinoffs: one set in 20th-century Boston and one focused on Polly Gray.

Tom Harper is set to direct the untitled film from a script written by series creator Steven Knight. Production is set to begin later this year. Plot details remain under wraps, but hints suggest the story will be set during World War II.\n\nIt's the news that fans of the Shelby family have been eagerly awaiting: Netflix has officially greenlit a Peaky Blinders feature film, marking the return of Oscar winner Cillian Murphy as the iconic Tommy Shelby, as per Deadline. This long-anticipated development follows years of speculation and hints, finally giving the Peaky faithful a reason to celebrate. Helming the untitled film will be Tom Harper, known for his work on Heart of Stone, The Aeronauts, and War & Peace. Harper is no stranger to the Peaky Blinders world, having directed the latter half of Season 1. Production is slated to begin later this year, based on a script by series creator Steven Knight.\n\nIn March, Knight told Birmingham World that the movie was moving forward with Murphy onboard. Although he had previously hinted at a film in interviews, this marks the first official confirmation from a studio. While plot details and further casting remain under wraps, Knight has hinted that the story will be set during World War II, promising a new and intense chapter in the Shelby saga.\n\nMurphy expressed his excitement, stating, \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me. It is very gratifying to be re-collaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders. This is one for the fans.\" Harper shared similar sentiments, reflecting on his initial work with the series. He said:\n\n\"When I first directed Peaky Blinders over 10 years ago, we didn't know what the series would become, but we did know that there was something in the alchemy of the cast and the writing that felt explosive. Peaky has always been a story about family -- and so it's incredibly exciting to be reuniting with Steve and Cillian to bring the movie to audiences across the world on Netflix.\"\n\nKnight added his enthusiasm, saying, \"I'm genuinely thrilled that this movie is about to happen. It will be an explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story. No holds barred. Full-on Peaky Blinders at war.\"\n\nHow Successful Is 'Peaky Blinders'?\n\nPeaky Blinders first aired in 2013 on BBC Two in the UK, with Netflix picking up international streaming rights in 2014. The show moved to BBC One in 2019, following its BAFTA win for Best Drama after Season 4. Over its six-season run, which concluded in 2022, Peaky Blinders became a global phenomenon, renowned for its exceptionally stylish view of the Shelby family's criminal exploits.\n\nThe series finale saw Tommy Shelby settling many scores, including the dramatic demise of his cousin Michael (Finn Cole), and ultimately riding off into the sunset on a white steed after entrusting the family business to his sister Ada (Sophie Rundle). Now, with the movie on the horizon, fans can look forward to seeing where Tommy's journey takes him next.\n\nStay tuned to Collider for more updates on the Peaky Blinders movie as production progresses.

It will be an explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story. No holds barred. Full-on Peaky Blinders at war.\"\n\nTom Harper said, \"When I first directed Peaky Blinders over 10 years ago, we didn't know what the series would become, but we did know that there was something in the alchemy of the cast and the writing that felt explosive. Peaky has always been a story about family -- and so it's incredibly exciting to be reuniting with Steve and Cillian to bring the movie to audiences across the world on Netflix.\"\n\nCillian Murphy is starring in the lead role again, but he'll also be an executive producer alongside Caryn Mandabach, Knight, and Guy Heeley. Murphy seems to be going down the producer route since he's also preparing to star in and produce the horror sequel \"28 Years Later\".\n\nEven though we don't have any plot details, the movie will be a continuation of the series. Season 6 ended with the Peaky Blinders emerging victorious after Thomas went through some traumatizing events, and he seemingly rode off on a white horse in the series finale. This perfect shot allowed the franchise to continue, and with Netflix already having confirmed the movie, it looks like there is more to explore.\n\nIGN also reported that there could be two new spinoffs in the franchise. One of them might be set in 20th-century Boston, and the other centered around Polly Gray, the aunt of Thomas Shelby.\n\nThere's no estimated release date considering the movie is in very early development, but hopefully, it won't be too long until we see Murphy's Thomas Shelby on our screen again.

The announcement marks the first official confirmation with a studio greenlight, bringing excitement to fans who have eagerly awaited the continuation of Tommy Shelby's story. Alongside Murphy, the production team includes producers Caryn Mandabach, Knight, Murphy, and Guy Heeley. Executive producers are Harper, David Kosse, Jamie Glazebrook, Andrew Warren, and David Mason, with the feature being made in association with BBC Film.\n\nCillian Murphy expressed his enthusiasm for the project, stating, \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me...It is very gratifying to be recollaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of 'Peaky Blinders.' This is one for the fans.\"\n\nHarper echoed this sentiment, reminiscing about the early days of the series. \"When I first directed 'Peaky Blinders' over 10 years ago, we didn't know what the series would become, but we did know that there was something in the alchemy of the cast and the writing that felt explosive.

It moved to BBC One in 2019 after its fourth season won the BAFTA for Best Drama. The show concluded its six-season run in 2022, with Murphy's character, Tommy Shelby, settling old scores and ultimately handing over the family business to his sister Ada, played by Sophie Rundle.\n\nCillian Murphy has remained busy since the series finale. In addition to his acclaimed role in \"Oppenheimer,\" he starred in and produced \"Small Things Like These,\" which premiered at this year's Berlin Film Festival. Concurrently, he launched his production company Big Things Films with Alan Moloney. Murphy is currently filming \"Steve,\" based on Max Porter's book \"Shy,\" which he and Moloney are producing for Netflix under their new banner.\n\nThe forthcoming \"Peaky Blinders\" film promises to be a fitting continuation of the beloved series, with fans eagerly anticipating its release. The collaboration of Knight, Harper, and Murphy, along with the support of Netflix and BBC Film, suggests a production that will stay true to the gritty, compelling storytelling that made the series a hit.\n\nAs production gears up, the excitement surrounding the return of Thomas Shelby and the \"Peaky Blinders\" universe continues to build.

War & Peace and Heart of Stone director Tom Harper, who helmed the second half of the BBC show's first season, is set to direct from a script by series creator Steven Knight. Production on the film, made in association with BBC Films, will begin later this year, according to Deadline.\n\nThe continuation of the Bafta-winning series, which became a global phenomenon on Netflix, has long been the subject of speculation and hints. Knight had previously told Birmingham World and Deadline that a movie would happen, but this is the first official studio confirmation. Murphy has been open about his enthusiasm to resume his role as the boss of the Shelby crime family.\n\n\"If there is more story to tell, and if Steven Knight delivers a script like I know he can, then I will be there,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in February. \"I mean, if we want to watch 50-year-old Tommy Shelby, I will be there. Let's do it.\"\n\nPlot details and other casting information are being kept under lock and key, although Knight previously told Deadline that the series finale in 2022 set up a movie to be set in the second world war. The show's six seasons spanned the end of the first world war through the end of Prohibition in the US.\n\nIn a statement to Deadline, Knight promised that the new film will \"be an explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story.

It moved to BBC One in 2019, following a Bafta win for best drama series for its fourth season.\n\n\"When I first directed Peaky Blinders over 10 years ago, we didn't know what the series would become, but we did know that there was something in the alchemy of the cast and the writing that felt explosive,\" said Harper in a statement. \"Peaky has always been a story about family -

This new cinematic venture is being produced in collaboration with the BBC, with Tom Harper directing the movie and Steven Knight penning the screenplay.\n\nMurphy has expressed his gratitude to the devoted fan base of the series, dedicating the upcoming film to them. \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me,\" the actor stated to a newswire. He mentioned that he is thrilled to be teaming up once again with Steven Knight and Tom Harper to bring the world of Peaky Blinders to life on the big screen. He said, \"This one's for the fans.\"\n\nThe series, which concluded with its sixth season in April 2022, followed the exploits of the Peaky Blinders crime gang in post-World War I. Creator Steven Knight had hinted at continuing the story in a different format, and now that vision is becoming a reality. Tom Harper, who directed several episodes of the show's first season in 2013, is ecstatic about the opportunity to helm the film. He added, \"It will be an explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story. No holds barred. Full on Peaky Blinders at war.\"\n\nSlated to begin production later this year, the film promises to be an epic continuation of the multi-award-winning gangster saga. Set against the backdrop of Birmingham between 1919 and 1934, Peaky Blinders followed the rise and fall of the Shelby family as they navigated a world torn apart by radical social, economic, and political upheaval.\n\nReflecting on the show's beginnings, Tom Harper recalled, \"When I first directed Peaky Blinders over a decade ago, we had no idea what the series would become, but we knew that the alchemy of the cast and the writing was something special. Peaky has always been a story about family, so it's incredibly exciting to be reuniting with Steve and Cillian to bring this movie to audiences worldwide on Netflix.\"\n\nThe series, which premiered on BBC Two in 2013 before moving to BBC One and eventually gaining international acclaim on Netflix, has left an indelible mark on the world of television. With the film on the horizon, fans of the series can eagerly anticipate a new chapter in the Peaky Blinders saga, one that promises to be just as explosive and captivating as its series.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Harper_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Harper (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steven Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peaky Blinders (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cillian Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/05-06-2024/1200-675-21642043-538-21642043-1717575352054.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624911", "eventUri": "eng-9624911", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Peaky Blinders first came on to our screens as a Netflix series; its six seasons running from 2013 until 2022.\n\nPeaky Blinders the series is set in Birmingham in the aftermath of World War 1, from 1919-34, and follows the fortunes of the Shelby family as they navigate the changing social, economic and political landscape.\n\nThe story of Peaky Blinders the film is still under wraps. According to an article on Tudum, \"The film, which goes into production later this year, will be an epic continuation of the multi-award-winning, six-season gangster saga.\"\n\nPeaky Blinders was a gang of mostly petty criminals - young boys in Birmingham who robbed, racketeered and controlled gambling to climb out of poverty in post-War Britain.\n\nThe Peaky Blinders dressed sharply in tailored jackets, lapelled overcoats, waistcoats, silk scarves and peaked flat caps that may or may not have hidden disposable blades.\n\nThe Netflix series Peaky Blinders drew upon this history for the background, the story and the on-point costumes that triggered a trend when the series launched almost a century after the historical Peaky Blinders peaked.\n\nCillian Murphy as Tommy Shelby\n\nAs World War 1 veteran-turned-gangster Thomas Shelby, Cillian Murphy communicates as much through his silences and body language as through his words. He's careful and considered. His love story with Grace tethers him initially and then drives him to distraction. His crime-fuelled empire grows exponentially, and he runs in an election to become member of Parliament. Even as his influence grows, his personal ties with friends and family are diluted. Cillian Murphy won four awards for his portrayal of Shelby: two Irish Film & Television Awards and two National Television Awards.\n\nFor Peaky Blinders the film, Cillian Murphy isn't the only big-name returnee. Steven Knight and Tom Harper are back as writer and director on the film. Speaking to Netflix, Knight said: \"I'm genuinely thrilled that this movie is about to happen... It will be an explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story. No holds barred. Full on Peaky Blinders at war.\"", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peaky Blinders (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cillian Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFTA_Film_&_Drama_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IFTA Film & Drama Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Harper_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Harper (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Television_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Television Awards"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/06/20240605101002_Cillian-Murphy-in-Peaky-Blinders.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624911", "eventUri": "eng-9624911", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Executive producers include Harper, David Kosse, Jamie Glazebrook, Andrew Warren and David Mason.\n\nAlthough plot details and further casting are still under wraps, the film is currently slated to begin production later this year, and will be made in association with BBC Film.\n\nLast year, Knight told fans that he had plans to expand the Peaky Blinders franchise beyond a series and the forthcoming film that was then in development.\n\n\"We could never have predicted how much this series about Birmingham \u00adgangsters in the '20s and '30s would resonate,\" Knight said during his speech at the 2023 TRIC Awards, where Peaky Blinders won the Drama Award. \"Some things just seem to have momentum and luck, and they stick, and everyone working on them feels that. What is coming next? It's to be announced. But it's not the end.\"", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Harper_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Harper (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peaky Blinders (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steven Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oppenheimer (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alchemy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physicist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black and white"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Last year, Margot Robbie used her \"Actors on Actors\" interview with Cillian Murphy to implore him (\"please do it, please\") to reprise his role as Tommy fucking Shelby. After years of reports and rumors, Netflix confirmed on June 4 that it has officially greenlit a Peaky Blinders movie starring Murphy. The currently-untitled project will be made in association with BBC Film. Original show creator Steven Knight will write the script, and Tom Harper (who directed several episodes in season one) will direct. \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me,\" Murphy said in a statement. \"It is very gratifying to be recollaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders. This is one for the fans.\" But mostly Margot, right?\n\nPeaky Blinders, which concluded in 2022 after six seasons, followed a crime gang in post-WWI Birmingham, England. In the finale, Shelby rode a horse off into an ambiguous ending. Netflix has not officially shared any plot details about the upcoming film, but Knight told Deadline in 2022 that a spinoff movie would be set in World War II. He also recently added to Netflix that the movie will be an \"explosive chapter\" and described it as full-on \"Peaky Blinders at war,\" so that seems to check out.

The creator, Steven Knight, has since been vocal about wanting to wrap up the story in a follow-up film rather than with a seventh season.\n\nNow, Netflix has finally confirmed the good news.\n\n\"Thomas Shelby returns. A Peaky Blinders Film starring Cillian Murphy is coming to Netflix,\" the streamer shared on X, formerly Twitter, alongside a photo of the movie's script.\n\nThe currently untitled movie has been written by Knight and will be helmed by Tom Harper, who directed several episodes of the show's debut season.\n\n\"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me,\" Murphy told Deadline. \"It is very gratifying to be recollaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders.

In addition to Murphy, it starred Tom Hardy, Paul Anderson and Helen McCrory.\n\nMurphy has spoken at length about his interest in returning to the role in a Peaky Blinders movie if presented with a worthy script.\n\n\"If there's more story there, I'd love to do it,\" he told Rolling Stone last year. \"But it has to be right. Steve Knight wrote 36 hours of television, and we left on such a high. I'm really proud of that last series. So, it would have to feel legitimate and justified to do more.\"\n\nHe had similarly told RadioTimes: \"The television part of the story is finished.

The movie's producers are all rich in experience, and the overall project will be made in conjunction with BBC Film.\n\nCurrently, there are no lines on what might be happening to the Shelbys as the plot is being kept under tight wraps. However, show creator Knight had said that the film would be taking place during the Second World War.\n\nSpeaking to Deadline on Wednesday (June 5), lead actor Cillian said that he was excited to be getting involved once again with the West Midlands-based family gang. \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me,\" he joked.\n\n\"It is very gratifying to be re-collaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders,\" he added. \"This is one for the fans.\"\n\nKnight also added that he was thrilled to see the show grow to become a full-blown movie, saying: \"I'm genuinely thrilled that this movie is about to happen.

The show made a move to BBC One in 2019, amid critical acclaim for the series - including a BAFTA for Best Drama.\n\nAs the final season of the show aired in 2022, lead character Tommy Shelby had given up his gang ways, settling scores - including killing his own cousin Michael, played by Finn Cole.

It will be an explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story. No holds barred. Full-on Peaky Blinders at war.'\n\nIn March, Steven thrilled fans after he confirmed Cillian would star in the film during an appearance at BirminghamWorld for the premiere of his BBC show This Town.\n\nHe said: '[Cillian] is definitely returning for it. We're shooting it in September just down the road in Digbeth.'\n\nThe film is set to begin filming at Digbeth Loc Studios in Birmingham in September, and will be set during the Second World War.\n\nOn the prospect of returning to the role of Thomas Shelby, Cillian previously told Rolling Stone last year: 'If there's more story there, I'd love to do it. But it has to be right.\n\n'Steve Knight wrote 36 hours of television, and we left on such a high. I'm really proud of that last series. So, it would have to feel legitimate and justified to do more.\n\nEchoing these sentiments on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in February, Cillian said: 'I have always said that if Knight delivers a script that I know he can deliver, because he is such a phenomenal writer, I'll be there.\n\nWriter Steven revealed: 'I'm genuinely thrilled that this movie is about to happen. It will be an explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story. No holds barred.

Let's do it.'\n\nCillian did admit he was 'relieved' when the BBC drama ended in 2022 - but emphasised he is now 'totally' on board with a movie adaptation.\n\nAfter he won his first Academy Award in March, Cillian said of his character Tommy: 'I loved playing him. He was exhausting and so wildly different for me that each time going back was kind of a journey.\n\n'I'm really not sentimental about work. I feel like the next thing is the most exciting thing. And I mean, it was a ten-year period in my life, so it is significant, but I always feel, like, let's keep moving.'\n\nCillian was awarded with the Oscar for Best Actor at the 96th Academy Awards for his performance as the titular character in Christopher Nolan's biopic Oppenheimer.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Cillian told the star-studded room that he was 'a very proud Irishman standing here tonight' before dedicating his win to 'peacemakers everywhere'.\n\nThe Irish actor has also hinted that Steven has more stories to tell about the Birmingham-based Shelby clan and their criminal activities between the 1880s and 1910s.\n\nPeaky Blinders launched in 2013 and garnered huge audiences both in Britain and overseas, attracting roles for silver-screen stars such as Tom Hardy and Anya Taylor-Joy.\n\nThe movie is set to begin filming at Digbeth Loc Studios in Birmingham in September, and will be set during the Second World War\n\nThe programme is loosely based on a real Birmingham gang of the same name operating from the 1880s to the 1920s who did the same illegal activities their fictional counterparts did.\n\nPeaky Blinders aired six series over nine years and ended with Tommy, who had been tricked into believing he had a terminal illness, surviving an assassination attempt orchestrated by his own nephew before killing him and moving away for a new life.\n\nBut the news sparks concerns for the welfare of Paul Anderson who plays Cillian's older brother in the show, Arthur Shelby, after he pleaded guilty to possession of crack cocaine earlier this year.\n\nThe 45-year-old was also found to have amphetamines, plus diazepam and pregabalin on him.\n\nHis continued erratic behaviour in recent months has prompted concern for his welfare.\n\nOne local shopkeeper, who counts Paul as a friend, told MailOnline: 'It's heartbreaking. He's a mess. But his erratic behaviour is causing real problems. He often seems dazed and not with it.\n\n'He's had arguments with people locally. He walks around making a lot of noise. We are all apprehensive. He had a big argument in Tesco a few weeks ago.\n\n'He is living like he is on another planet. He's been in public topless. He struggles to walk. It's a great concern. He looks out of control. It's tragic.'\n\nBut last week it seemed the actor was clearing up his act - quite literally - as he ventured out in London to Tesco and bought various cleaning products, among them shampoo, Dove deodorant, kitchen roll and Vanish stain remover.\n\nBut the news sparks concerns for the welfare of Paul Anderson after he pleaded guilty to possession of crack cocaine earlier this year (pictured in 2016)\n\nThe 45-year-old - who plays Cillian's older brother in the show, Arthur Shelby (pictured - has prompted concern for his welfare with his continued erratic behaviour in recent months",

It is very gratifying to be recollaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders. This is one for the fans'\"\n\nThe Oscar winning actor won critical praise thanks to his portrayal of the brooding gangster in the hit BBC series, which concluded its six-season run in 2022. Now, fans are buzzing with the revelation that Murphy will continue wielding power as the Shelby family's head in the upcoming movie adaptation.\n\n\"ITS HAPPENING OMG STAY CALM,\" one excited fan wrote online as Netflix broke the news. \"Going to be screaming about this for weeks actually,\" another added, as a third declared: \"IM SO SEATED !!! TOMMY F***ING SHELBY BACK ON MY SCREENNNN.\"\n\nWriter Stephen Knight, 64, previously spilled the beans while attending the premiere of his latest series, This Town, in Birmingham, where he assured BirminghamWorld that Cillian is \"definitely\" on board for the wartime drama. \"He definitely is returning for it. We're shooting it in September just down the road in Digbeth,\" he disclosed to the local news outlet earlier this year.\n\nFans were abuzz with anticipation that Murphy might return to his iconic role after he was reportedly seen in a January meeting with Peaky Blinders creator Wright. At the time, whispers suggested his involvement was \"shrouded in secrecy\".\n\nMurphy hinted last year at being \"open to the idea\" of joining the film adaptation, despite appreciating the \"ambiguity\" of the series finale, which left viewers with the lasting image of Tommy Shelby riding into the unknown. Chatting with Margot Robbie for Variety, he confessed: \"I'm totally open to the idea but y'know I also do think it was a kind of perfect six seasons. It's sometimes hard to move into the film format and I kinda do like the ambiguity of the ending. But I'm always open to like a great script.\"\n\nThe buzz around Murphy has only grown since he snagged an Oscar earlier this year for his stunning performance in Oppenheimer (2023), besting fellow nominees Bradley Cooper, Colman Domingo, Paul Giamatti, and Jeffrey Wright for the Best Actor gong. Following his Oscar triumph, Peaky Blinders scribe Steven couldn't contain his praise for Cillian, as reported by BirminghamWorld. He lauded the actor's win as \"deserved\", celebrating him as \"brilliant\" and \"such a great\" individual, and remarked: \"He deserves everything he gets.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zoe_delaney@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Zoe Delaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peaky Blinders (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cillian Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Harper_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Harper (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oppenheimer (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colman_Domingo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colman Domingo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Giamatti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Giamatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Robbie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margot Robbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32961452.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_24252700-high_res-peaky-blinders-vi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624911", "eventUri": "eng-9624911", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The film will be directed by Tom Harper (\"Heart of Stone,\" \"Wild Rose\"), who directed episodes of the show's first season in 2013.\n\nRead More: Venom: The Last Dance Trailer Unleashes Symbiote Chaos!\n\nIn March, Knight confirmed to Birmingham World that the movie was progressing with Murphy on board. He had previously informed Deadline about the movie's likelihood. However, this marks the first official confirmation with a studio greenlight.\n\n\"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me. ... It is very gratifying to be recollaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of 'Peaky Blinders.' This is one for the fans,\" Murphy said in a statement.\n\nOver the years, and more recently, Murphy has consistently expressed his openness to returning for a Peaky Blinders film if the script met his standards, with Knight also indicating his interest and commitment to such a project. In a 2022 interview with Esquire, Knight shared, \"The film, I know exactly what it's about. And I know what two stories it's going to tell... For all we know somebody is going to pop out - I think I know who it's going to be.\"\n\n\"When I first directed 'Peaky Blinders' over 10 years ago, we didn't know what the series would become, but we did know that there was something in the alchemy of the cast and the writing that felt explosive. 'Peaky' has always been a story about family - and so it's incredibly exciting to be reuniting with Steve and Cillian to bring the movie to audiences across the world on Netflix,\" Harper added.\n\nThe next chapter of the saga, situated in the lawless avenues of Birmingham during the 1900s, has been penned by the show's creator, Steven Knight. Knight will collaborate in production with Cillian Murphy, Caryn Mandabach, and Guy Heeley. Serving as executive producers are Tom Harper, David Kosse, Jamie Glazebrook, Andrew Warren, and David Mason.\n\n\"I'm genuinely thrilled that this movie is about to happen,\" Knight said. \"It will be an explosive chapter in the 'Peaky Blinders' story. No holds barred. Full on 'Peaky Blinders' at war.\"\n\nPlot specifics and additional casting details are being kept confidential. Production for the film is scheduled to commence later this year and will be conducted in collaboration with BBC Film.\n\nPeaky, a worldwide sensation, debuted on BBC Two in the UK in 2013, with Netflix joining the distribution in 2014. Following its fourth season's BAFTA win for Best Drama, the series moved from BBC Two to BBC One in 2019. Ultimately, the show concluded its six-season run in 2022.\n\nDuring the finale, Murphy's character Tommy settled various conflicts, including the demise of his cousin Michael (Finn Cole), before departing, leaving the family business in the hands of his sister Ada (Sophie Rundle).3\n\nPrior to winning the Best Actor Academy Award for Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer in March, Murphy was busy both acting in and producing Small Things Like These, which premiered at this year's Berlin Film Festival. Simultaneously, he launched his production company, Big Things Films, alongside Alan Moloney. Currently, he's involved in filming Steve, an adaptation of Max Porter's book Shy, which Murphy and Moloney are producing under Big Things for Netflix.\n\nAdditionally, Murphy has signed on for Blood Runs Coal, based on Mark A Bradley's book about the murder of union leader Joseph Yablonski, a project preemptively acquired by Oppenheimer studio Universal.\n\nWhile Shelby was arguably Murphy's most iconic role, he recently reached a career peak with Christopher Nolan's historical epic Oppenheimer for Universal, portraying the theoretical physicist behind the atomic bomb. His performance in the star-studded ensemble drama earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor, along with a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, and numerous other accolades.\n\nNow among the most sought-after actors in the industry, Murphy's latest film, the Irish drama Small Things Like These from Artists Equity -- the production company of Ben Affleck and his Oppenheimer co-star Matt Damon -- premiered to critical acclaim at the Berlin Film Festival in February.\n\nMurphy is represented by CAA, Lou Coulson Associates, David Weber, and Main Stage PR; Harper is represented by Josh Varney at 42 and Rob Carlson at UTA.", "source": {"uri": "technosports.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechnoSports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Harper_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Harper (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steven Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peaky Blinders (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cillian Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

The streaming giant posted on X last night with official news of the long-awaited conclusion to the popular crime drama.\n\nThe post from Netflix includes a picture of the script and a comment from lead actor Cillian Murphy: \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me.\"\n\n\"It is very gratifying to be recollaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders. This is one for the fans,\" Murphy says.\n\nPeaky Blinders is a hugely popular British drama that ran on the BBC for six series between 2013 and 2022 with a dance show. Set in 1920s Birmingham, it followed a fictionalised version of the real Peaky Blinders gang.\n\nThe series won acclaim for its period drama setting, outstanding acting from the likes of Murphy and Helen McCrory, sharp dialogue, and iconic contemporary soundtrack.\n\nWhile the show officially finished after its sixth series in 2022 on the BBC, series creator Steven Knight has spoken about wanting to make a film to wrap up the loose ends of the show's grand storyline.\n\nNow, thanks to Netflix - the streaming giant already had international distribution rights for the show - Peaky Blinders will return to the big screen with Knight's grand cinematic finale.\n\n\"It will be an explosive chapter in the Peaky Blinders story,\" Knight says, noting how the film will leave \"no holds barred.\"\n\nTom Harper who is slated to direct says: \"When I first directed Peaky Blinders over 10 years ago we didn't know what the series would become, but we did know that there was something in the alchemy of the cast and the writing that felt explosive.\"\n\nPeaky Blinders trotted onto TV screens as one of those rare brilliantly fully-formed shows. Irish actor Cillian Murphy was fully transformed into the cold-blooded manipulative criminal Tommy Shelby as he strode through the derelict streets of post-World War One Birmingham on his horse to the tune of Nick Cave's 'Red Right Hand'.\n\nThe period was achingly beautifully recreated with an anarchic anachronistic flair. This was depression-era Britain fuelled by Scorsese-esque dialogue, vibrant characters played by acting heavyweights and a killer punk soundtrack.\n\nWhile the show's first season started with Shelby and his gang of Peaky Blinders thugs as the local gangsters of a downtrodden midlands dump, the show's ambition grew with its characters. By the end of the sixth season, Shelby is an MP for Birmingham, making illegal deals to sell liquor to prohibition-era America, while trading barbs with the fascist Oswald Mosely.\n\nThe cast had also grown to incorporate a smorgasbord of talent. Alongside Murphy, who collected an Oscar for his titular role in Oppenheimer this year, the show had featured Sam Neill, Tom Hardy, Paddy Considine, Adrien Brody, Aidan Gillen, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Stephen Graham among many others.\n\nHowever, the show was rocked by the sudden death of regular cast member Helen McCrory in 2021. McCrory starred as the gang's matriarch Elizabeth 'Polly' Gray, and her absence was keenly felt in the final series.\n\nUnmoored without McCrory, after some of the most confidently made television in recent years, the show stumbled through the last series, leaving many plot threads still fraying at the edges.\n\nOsward Mosely, the real-life British fascist whose actions led to the 1936 Battle of Cable Street and in the show's universe, had bested Shelby at the end of season five, feels like the biggest omission in the show's chronology.\n\nSimilarly, plot points involving rival Scottish gang the Billy Boys, Liverpool businessman Hayden Stagg (played painfully briefly by Stephen Graham), and how the Shelby's fraught liquor trade with the American gangsters, all are yet to be fully played out.\n\nWill a single film be able to wrap all these threads up in a neat two hours? That's hard to say. What's hopefully guaranteed is that with Netflix financially backing the film and Murphy agreeing to return at the peak of his career, the film should have all the requisite funds thrown at it to once again fully realise the bombastic world of Peaky Blinders to the big screen.\n\nIf it also means more incredible needle drop moments from the likes of Nick Cave, PJ Harvey, Radiohead, the White Stripes, and Anna Calvi, then count us in...

Despite his reputation on the big screen, Murphy had previously expressed an interest about potentially returning as Shelby in the movie adaptation.\n\nWhen previously talking about the film, Knight hoped that the movie would be a springboard for them to work on separate projects.

It has been confirmed that a movie adaptation of the hit TV show is in the works, and will see Cillian Murphy reprise his role as Birmingham's smoothest gangster, Tommy Shelby.\n\nThe news was revealed on Netflix's official X account after they shared a snap of the script. The caption read: \"Tommy Shelby returns. A Peaky Blinders Film starring Cillian Murphy is coming to Netflix.\"\n\nThe post included a message from Cilliian, who said: \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me...It is very gratifying to be recollaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders. This is one for the fans.\"\n\nResponding to the exciting news, one person wrote: \"The world belongs to Cillian Murphy. He got his Oscar, now he can get back to the fun stuff.\" Another fan added: \"Tommy Shelby always have a way of making us glued to our screen. I'm so in for it.\"\n\nA third person wrote: \"YESSSSSS! The king is back! Can't wait to see Cillian Murphy reprise his iconic role as Tommy Shelby in the Peaky Blinders film - it's going to be EPIC!\"\n\nThe show's creator, Steven Knight, has spoken about wanting to make a movie since the show finished with seven seasons back in 2022. He told the BBC back in March: \"Murphy is definitely returning for [the movie]. We're shooting it in September just down the road in Digbeth.\"\n\nCillian previously told Rolling Stone that he'd love to be involved, saying: \"If there's more story there, I'd love to do it. But it has to be right. Steve Knight wrote 36 hours of television, and we left on such a high. I'm really proud of that last series. So, it would have to feel legitimate and justified to do more.\"\n\nWhen will the Peaky Blinders movie be released?\n\nSince the project is meant to begin production in September, the filming schedule could suggest that the film will have a 2025 release date - so watch this space!\n\nWho will be in the cast?\n\nCillian is the only person confirmed to be reprising their role so far, but we are expecting Paul Anderson as Arthur Shelby, Sophie Rundle as Ada Shelby and Joe Cole as John Shelby to make a comeback for the movie.\n\nThe movie will miss the late Helen McCrory, who starred in the show as Tommy's aunt, Polly. Speaking to Variety, he said: \"I think the whole series is really in tribute to her and to honour her. Her presence and her character's presence are very much still felt in the series, and it is very much part of Tommy's journey in the season.\n\n\"It'll be different without her, you know.

This line is now going to reverberate again in your homes as Netflix announces the Peaky Blinders movie. It will be made in collaboration with BBC. Lead star Cillian Murphy, who is basking in his Oscar win for Oppenheimer, will be back as the dangerous but charming Birmingham gangster Thomas Shelby. 'Tommy Shelby Returns': Peaky Blinders Movie Starring Cillian Murphy Greenlit by Netflix; Oscar-Winner to Co Produce It Alongside Steven Knight.\n\nThe film will be directed by Tom Harper and written by Steven Knight. The Peaky Blinders series follows the lives of Thomas Shelby and his brothers. Shelby, who is back from the First World War, rises up the ranks of London's crime scene and finally ends up in the UK Parliament.\n\nThe movie is like an ode to the crazy fans of the show. In a statement, Cillian Murphy said in a statement, \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me. It is very gratifying to be re-collaborating with Steven Knight and Tom Harper on the film version of Peaky Blinders. This is one for the fans.\"\n\nIf you are a new Thomas Shelby fan and not much acquainted with the cult characters of Peaky Blinders, here is a lowdown of some of the more iconic ones.\n\nLate Helen McCrory played Aunt Pol, who is the matriarch of the Shelby family. She is also a shrewd businesswoman and mediator and can wield a gun if need be. Fans of the series will sorely miss the late Helen McCrory, who passed away in 2021, if makers decide to have the character of Aunt Polly Gray in the movie.\n\nAlfie Solomons is a close business associate of Thomas Shelby. He is a deceitful, heartless, and ruthless man. Tom Hardy played the character to perfection. He is a fan favorite, like Aunt Pol.\n\nGrace, played by actress Annabelle Wallis, dies quite early in the series. She is the only woman Thomas Shelby truly loved. Cillian Murphy and Annabelle Wallis had amazing chemistry and the scene where she sings to him has its own fan base.

Thomas Shelby also says he is his most dangerous enemy.\n\nArthur Shelby is a man who is possessed by demons after the war. Paul Anderson brought madness, vulnerability and intensity to the character in equal measure. He is the bro you want by your side.\n\nOn the show, she is a sex worker who starts working in Thomas Shelby's company. Natasha O'Keeffe played Lizzie, one of the most selfless characters of Peaky Blinders.\n\nHe is a Roman gipsy hired by Thomas Shelby to look after the family. He is also the father of Bonnie, who was killed by The Billy Boys.\n\nWell, these were some of the characters from Peaky Blinders whom we loved.

The series began airing from on 12 September 2013 and went up to the sixth season. In January 2021, it was announced that the sixth series would be the last, followed by a spin-off film. The final installment of Peaky Blinders was released in 2022.\n\nCillian received praise for playing the character of American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023). The epic thriller was set in the backdrop of World War 2 and the usage of nuclear weapons. Cillian won an Oscar and BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Awards) for his portrayal of the controversial scientist in the film.\n\nCillian will be next seen in the historical drama Small Things Like These and Danny Boyle's apocalyptic horror - 28 Years Later.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peaky Blinders (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Harper_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Harper (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steven Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cillian Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Historical drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The movie's amped-up violence suggests Tommy Shelby's death is likely, completing his redemptive arc with a satisfying conclusion. Tommy's possibility of redemption is at stake in the movie, as death could enforce his claimed redemption arc afterward. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe Peaky Blinders movie sequel is officially underway, and I couldn't be more worried about Tommy Shelby's fate. I'll admit, I was apprehensive when rumors of a Peaky Blinders movie began to float around. Barring some standouts, I've never been fond of the TV series movie follow-up, with The Many Saints of Newark leaving poor taste in recent years, and I was in the camp of audiences who found the Peaky Blinders season 6 ending to be moving and conclusive in its own right.\n\nAll episodes of Peaky Blinders are streaming on Netflix.\n\nWhile not widely perceived as the best Peaky Blinders season, I experienced season 6 as an emotional deep dive into the anxiety-inducing psychology of Tommy Shelby. There was no Luca Changretta or Father Hughes to root against; the villain was instead Tommy's personal demons, and I found his choice to live and seek out redemption far more compelling than just another dead TV antihero. The final plot twist rattled me, and I could have lived happily knowing Tommy had ridden off on a beautiful white horse, putting his past behind him, but it seems there's still business to attend to.\n\nThe Peaky Blinders Movie Being \"At War\" Makes Tommy Shelby's Death More Likely The Peaky Blinders Movie Sequel Should Amp Up The Action For An Explosive Climax Close\n\nEverything I've read about the Peaky Blinders movie suggests that it will be an explosive, climactic finish. Creator Steven Knight described it as \"Full-on Peaky Blinders at war.\" Cillian Murphy stated, \"It seems like Tommy Shelby wasn't finished with me,\" suggesting a particular \"one last ride\" type of feel to the movie. After seeing Tommy just barely survive the TV series and find his will to live, I'm excited but anxious to see where the film takes him. Given the amped-up violence and action in the movie, death seems like the most likely outcome for Tommy Shelby.\n\nLike many of TV's greatest morally ambiguous antiheroes, there were times when Tommy deserved to be fully recognized as a villain. Even in season 6, he guns down several innocent people in outrage after his daughter's death. Characters like Lizzie and Arthur constantly suffer in his sphere of influence, for which he shows little compassion. Yet, after the show's ending, I still want to believe he's capable of doing something good, and I feel genuinely worried about what will happen to him. Tommy's death must be satisfying, given how the idea was already danced around for an entire season.\n\nRelated 25 Best Peaky Blinders Quotes (That We Will Always Remember)\n\nPeaky Blinders is a gritty crime series of gangsters fighting for supremacy. The BBC series has given many memorable quotes, but here are the best.\n\nWhy Dying Makes Perfect Sense For Tommy Shelby's Peaky Blinders Ending Death Would Perfectly Conclude Tommy Shelby's Redemptive Arc, If He Has One\n\nMuch of Peaky Blinders revolves around this idea of \"borrowed time.\" Tommy Shelby's WWI tunneling flashbacks are vital to his origins as the pure danger of such a job leaves him with a feeling that he shouldn't have survived, and that anything beyond that is extra time he's been gifted. After cheating death again in season 6, when he realizes Dr. Holford has lied to him, Tommy once again feels like he's on borrowed time, though this time, deciding to follow a more righteous path, signified by Tommy sparing Holford's life and by the white horse.\n\nTommy dying at the end of season 6 would've felt incomplete\n\nThis thematic questioning and characterization is a massive part of what made the Peaky Blinders TV ending so satisfying to me. Tommy dying at the end of season 6 would've felt incomplete, as he'd have left behind a path of nothing but revenge and destruction with Ruby and Michael's deaths. Now, Tommy can use his second batch of borrowed time to do something meaningful for a good purpose, and there's nothing like a sacrificial death in a movie to enforce the argument for his redemption. After the Peaky Blinders movie, we can decide for sure whether he's redeemed.\n\nPeaky Blinders Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nPeaky Blinders is a historical crime drama created and written by Steven Knight and starring Cillian Murphy, Sam Neill, and Helen McCrory.

It ran for six seasons across ten years and received widespread critical acclaim, winning Best Drama Series at the British Academy Television Awards and Best Drama Performance for Murphy at the National Television Awards. The characters in the show are fictional but it is loosely based on the real-life Peaky Blinders street gang that operated in Birmingham, England, through the early 1900s. The show follows the fictional Shelby family, helmed by crime boss Tommy Shelby, as they work to expand their control outside of Birmingham following the first World War.\n\nThe popularity of \"Peaky Blinders\" launched a revival of 1920s fashion, including requests for Thomas Shelby's iconic haircut and newsboy caps, Esquire reported. The Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom even reported a rise in baby names stolen from characters in the show, particularly the names Arthur, Finn and Tommy. Retired professional wrestler and \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" actor Dave Bautista has a tattoo of Murphy's character on his thigh and Apple TV's \"Ted Lasso\" used the \"Peaky Blinders\" theme song in a third season episode. Super fans have themed their weddings around the popular show, and a themed bar based on the series opened in Manchester in 2018.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peaky Blinders (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cillian Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_Television_Award_for_Best_Drama_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_Television_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Academy Television Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Television_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Television Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Lasso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Bautista", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Bautista"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Office for National Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esquire (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Theme_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Theme Songs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6661f186c77a0161fb293a1e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3624,2040,x0,y138,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624911", "eventUri": "eng-9624911", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

TOMMY F***ING SHELBY BACK ON MY SCREENNNN.\"\n\nWriter Stephen Knight, 64, previously spilled the beans while attending the premiere of his latest series, This Town, in Birmingham, where he assured BirminghamWorld that Cillian is \"definitely\" on board for the wartime drama. \"He definitely is returning for it. We're shooting it in September just down the road in Digbeth,\" he disclosed to the local news outlet earlier this year.\n\nFans were abuzz with anticipation that Murphy might return to his iconic role after he was reportedly seen in a January meeting with Peaky Blinders creator Wright. At the time, whispers suggested his involvement was \"shrouded in secrecy\".\n\nMurphy hinted last year at being \"open to the idea\" of joining the film adaptation, despite appreciating the \"ambiguity\" of the series finale, which left viewers with the lasting image of Tommy Shelby riding into the unknown. Chatting with Margot Robbie for Variety, he confessed: \"I'm totally open to the idea but y'know I also do think it was a kind of perfect six seasons. It's sometimes hard to move into the film format and I kinda do like the ambiguity of the ending. But I'm always open to like a great script.\"\n\nThe buzz around Murphy has only grown since he snagged an Oscar earlier this year for his stunning performance in Oppenheimer (2023), besting fellow nominees Bradley Cooper, Colman Domingo, Paul Giamatti, and Jeffrey Wright for the Best Actor gong. Following his Oscar triumph, Peaky Blinders scribe Steven couldn't contain his praise for Cillian, as reported by BirminghamWorld. He lauded the actor's win as \"deserved\", celebrating him as \"brilliant\" and \"such a great\" individual, and remarked: \"He deserves everything he gets.\"\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

Isiah Jesus could have a bigger role in the movie with potentially new motivations, elevating his importance. Characters like Alfie Solomons and Gina Gray must return for the film to tie into the Boston spinoff and maintain continuity. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe Peaky Blinders movie has been officially greenlit with Cillian Murphy reprising his role as Tommy Shelby, but the protagonist isn't the only character who needs to return. Netflix officially confirmed that The Peaky Blinders movie is happening and that Murphy will be part of the project, meaning the hit drama series can finally appear on the big screen. Peaky Blinders first debuted in 2013 and concluded almost a decade later. The gritty British crime show became popular all around the world and received incredible reviews, leading to rumors about a potential movie.\n\nWhile the show's creator, Steven Knight, has been vocal about a movie, the project still had an element of doubt, but Netflix's confirmation means the iconic gang can finally continue their story. Despite Peaky Blinders season 6's perfect ending, the series left room for the characters to return, and with the movie's official announcement, it's no surprise the show's protagonist will be back. However, it is unclear who else will be reprising their role, but with Tommy's journey continuing, several characters have to join him in returning for the Peaky Blinders movie.\n\nRelated Peaky Blinders Movie: Confirmation, Cast & Everything We Know\n\nThough the series concluded with season 6, Peaky Blinders is living on in a feature film, and there are already exciting updates about the new movie.\n\n10 Daryl McCormack As Isiah Jesus Isiah Jesus May Have A Bigger Role In The Peaky Blinders Movie\n\nIsiah Jesus is one of the Peaky Blinders' younger members, but he has remained loyal to the group throughout his time with them. He has always been a reliable soldier by following in his father's footsteps and dedicating himself to the gang. Unfortunately, Isiah's father, Jeremiah, is unlikely to feature in the movie as Benjamin Zephaniah passed away in 2023 after playing the character since season 1. While this is a huge blow for Peaky Blinders and the acting world as a whole, it also gives the movie a reason to bring back Isiah.\n\nHe was still on good terms with the gang, and if the franchise opts to write out Jeremiah as opposed to recasting him, Isiah could have an elevated role. The movie could put a spotlight on Isiah by having him honor his father's history with the crew and taking on similar responsibilities, making him even more central to the story. This would be a great way of having a popular character return for the movie, while also paying respect to how important Zephaniah's legacy was to the series.\n\n9 Charles Shelby Tommy's Son Is Central To The Overall Story\n\nGiven story details are still scarce regarding the Peaky Blinders movie, it is unclear how far into the future the film may be set, meaning Billy Jenkins may not be suitable to reprise the role. However, regardless of who portrays Charles Shelby, the character has to return for the new film. Charles may not be the most popular member of the Shelby family in Peaky Blinders, but there is no denying he holds a crucial role in the story, especially when it comes to Tommy.\n\nTommy's children are undoubtedly a big part of his character arc, as his daughter's death took a heavy toll on him. Likewise, Charlie being kidnapped in season 3 was another crucial event in Tommy's life that made his story so intriguing. With Charles surviving the finale, it seems inevitable he will be involved in the film in some capacity. Whether he is still a child and has a small cameo or has grown older and shown interest in the gang, Charlie should have an appearance to remind the audience of his importance.\n\n8 Anya Taylor-Joy As Gina Gray Gina's Return Could Tie In With The Boston Spinoff\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy's return as Gina Gray would give the Peaky Blinders movie a connection to the upcoming Boston spinoff alongside some extra box office pedigree. The movie is one of several Peaky Blinders spinoffs that have been confirmed, and with a new show taking place in Boston, Gina provides the perfect connection. Although Michael was killed off in the final season, Gina survived and headed back to America, but her fate after this is unknown. Gina had connections to Boston as her uncle was a gangster with plenty of power in the city, meaning she could appear in the spinoff.\n\nThis would be the perfect reason to have Taylor-Joy reprise her role in the movie as well since it could link the two. Gina was supposedly pregnant with Michael's child before she died, meaning she still has connections to the Shelby family despite their disdain towards her. Therefore, this could give her a reason to return from a story perspective, and with Taylor-Joy becoming a huge name in Hollywood, it would add some star power to appear alongside Murphy.\n\n7 Packy Lee As Johnny Dogs Johnny Dogs Is One Of The Gang's Longest Serving Allies\n\nAlthough Johnny Dogs wasn't the most violent member of the Peaky Blinders gang, he did get his hands dirty when required and proved to be one of Tommy's most trustworthy men. Johnny has been part of the show since season 1, and if the crew is making their way to the big screen, it wouldn't feel right proceeding without him. He was often the voice of reason in the show, and Tommy's empire would never have grown as large as it did without him.\n\nJohnny was never too deeply involved in some of the most gritty and bloody fights, but he was always there for the crew, and it would be tough to explain his absence. If the Peaky Blinders are in conflict, it would feel out of character for Johnny to have no interest, making his appearance a necessity. While the film could write him out and give him a more peaceful conclusion, it would make more sense to include Johnny and give him his happy ending on the big screen.\n\n6 Ned Dennehy As Charlie Strong Charlie's Relationship With The Shelby's Means He Must Return\n\nMuch like Johnny Dogs, Charlie Strong has been a long-serving ally to the Peaky Blinders and has an even closer relationship with the Shelby family. He is the non-biological uncle of Tommy, Arthur, Ada, and Finn after his sister married into the family, making him a reliable member of the gang. His wisdom and experience meant he was an ever-present part of the Peaky Blinders' operations, and it only makes sense that he appears once again.\n\nOutside his involvement with the crew, he was also a big part of Shelby Company Limited, and often focused on the more legitimate business practices like taking care of horses. Although Charlie may not have a huge role in the movie given he isn't one of the more violent members, his involvement with the gang and the Shelby family makes him a major part of the Peaky Blinders franchise, and the film would benefit from having Ned Dennehy reprising his role.\n\n5 Conrad Khan As Duke Shelby Tommy's Eldest Son Could Play A Pivotal Part In The Movie\n\nWhile the inclusion of Tommy's illegitimate son could have damaged Peaky Blinders' final season, Duke Shelby proved to be a great addition and should return for the film. Duke helped uncover the traitor within the Peaky Blinders gang and saved Isiah Jesus' life in the process, instantly proving his value to the gang. This makes him the perfect successor to Tommy in the criminal world and if Peaky Blinders is to continue without Cillian Murphy in the future, Conrad Khan's Duke could be the next protagonist.\n\nFocusing more on Duke's role within the gang makes sense, especially as his feud with Finn is already set up. Finn was kicked out of the Peaky Blinders and the Shelby family cut ties with him, making him swear revenge on Duke. If the franchise does choose to explore this story down the line, it makes sense to make Duke feel even more pivotal to the story and elevate his role; therefore, an appearance in the movie is the perfect way to do so.\n\n4 Tom Hardy As Alfie Solomons Alfie's Popularity Among The Audience Means He Should Be Involved\n\nAlfie Solomons is one of the most popular characters in Peaky Blinders, meaning a return for the movie is needed. Tom Hardy is one of the biggest names associated with the show, and it is no surprise he also played one of the best characters. Although Alfie acted as an antagonist at times, he often found a way to coexist with Tommy, creating a strange alliance that audiences loved. Given his ties to Boston, Alfie Solomons could appear in the Peaky Blinders spinoff, but like Gina, a movie cameo would be fitting.\n\nHardy's character was seemingly killed off at one point, but returned later in the series, proving his presence in Peaky Blinders is inevitable. While seeing Hardy continue his role in the spinoff would be welcomed, it would be a waste not to have him feature in the franchise's big screen debut as well, suggesting he needs to be a part of the project. Regardless of what role Alfie played, fans would be over the moon to see the character interact with Tommy one last time, emphasizing that the movie should include him at all costs.\n\nRelated 10 Things That Need To Happen In The Peaky Blinders Movie\n\nNow that the Peaky Blinders movie is confirmed, speculation about the upcoming plotlines makes it clear how many questions must be answered.\n\n3 Natasha O'Keeffe As Lizzie Shelby Lizzie Was Crucial To Tommy's Survival In The Final Season\n\nDespite how frequently Tommy mistreated Lizzie over the course of the series, the two had a child together and even got married, which made her one of the franchise's most crucial characters. While many characters have had relationships with Tommy, no one knows him quite as well as Lizzie. Tommy had multiple business partners, love interests, and gang associates, but Lizzie was one of the few characters who could truly see the protagonist's flaws and was the most influential in trying to make him a better man.\n\nThis makes her return in the movie inevitable as Tommy's appearance all but confirms Lizzie will be back as well. Their relationship may not be perfect, but Lizzie is still his wife, and it only makes sense for her to return alongside him, especially as she was a critical part of Tommy surviving the final season. O'Keeffe is also one of the unsung heroes of the Peaky Blinders franchise, and she deserves a chance to bring one of her most iconic characters to the big screen.\n\n2 Sophie Rundle As Ada Thorne Ada Helped Keep The Family Shelby Together\n\nAda proved to be the rock of the Shelby family in Peaky Blinders, and no matter how much she tried to get away from all the trouble, she was always pulled back in. While she may not have been overly involved in the criminal element, Ada's connections have definitely helped her brothers on more than one occasion, and she will still be a valuable member of the family in the future. Ada was a mainstay on the show, but she wasn't always at the center of the story, and her movie role could be similar.\n\nLike some of the previous entries, she may have a more limited role in the film, potentially even just a small cameo, but excluding her from the project entirely would make it feel incomplete. Sophie Rundle's talent was constantly on show whenever she was on-screen, and there's no doubt she could do a fabulous job as Ada one more time. Although Ada managed to move on from the death of her partner, she never got the proper ending she deserved, and the Peaky Blinders movie offers the chance for her to close her story for good.\n\n1 Paul Anderson As Arthur Shelby Arthur Has To Continue Being Tommy's Right-Hand Man\n\nOf all the Peaky Blinders characters that must return for the movie, Arthur Shelby is at the top of the list. Arthur had some tremendous character development throughout his time on the show, and despite all the pain, tragedy, and loss he faced, Arthur remained Tommy's right-hand man until the very end. The two brothers fought on numerous occasions and were often a bad influence on each other, but they remained loyal to their family and the Peaky Blinders.\n\nArthur's unfiltered rage and humorous moments made him one of Peaky Blinders' best characters and he seems more likely to return than anyone. Even if the movie kept Tommy away from the gang and his business, Arthur is clearly one of the people closest to him, meaning he could be involved regardless of the storyline. Paul Anderson did a fantastic job bringing Arthur to life, and as long as the script is good enough, he seems ready for a return which would help elevate the Peaky Blinders film.\n\nPeaky Blinders\n\nPeaky Blinders is a historical crime drama created and written by Steven Knight and starring Cillian Murphy, Sam Neill, and Helen McCrory. The television show is based on the gang, Peaky Blinders, a group that banded together after the end of World War I.", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"},

Creator Steven Knight put the whole thing on a tilt from the start by not setting his gangster drama in London, but in (then) unfashionable Birmingham. He made family leader Tommy Shelby not the eldest but the middle brother. He mad Helen McCrory's indelible Polly Gray not Tommy's mother but his aunt. His working class characters weren't to be pitied, but feared and respected... Nothing, from the contemporary rock music to the interweaving of Romany culture, was quite what period audiences had come to expect.\n\nKnight's slanted take on historical drama was exemplified at the climax of the Peaky Blinders series one finale, directed by Tom Harper (The Aeronauts, War & Peace). Now, over a decade later, Harper is coming back to direct the long-discussed Peaky Blinders movie, which starts filming in September 2024 in the West Midlands, after being officially commissioned by Netflix and confirmed to star Oppenheimer Oscar-winner Cillian Murphy as Tommy Shelby.\n\nIn the Harper-directed 2013 series one finale, the Peaky Blinders gather in the lane outside The Garrison Tavern to face racecourse bookie Billy Kimber (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his men. It's the climax of a series-long rivalry between the two gangs, and bullets are expected to fly - especially after Tommy unveils the Lewis machine gun wielded by his brother-in-law Freddie Thorne (Iddo Goldberg).\n\nJust as the soldiers raise their weapons and prepare to fire, a voice is heard calling \"Move\", and the battalion splits apart as Sophie Rundle's Ada Thorne - Tommy's sister and Freddie's wife - dressed in widow's weeds and pushing a pram containing her and Freddie's crying baby stands between the two gangs. She tells the men to shut up and listen. Most of them had fought in France and so knew the slaughter and bloodshed that would come next. Ada tells them to look at her, wearing black for her soon-to-be-dead brothers and husband, and think of the people who'll wear black for them. \"Fight if you want to,\" she concludes, \"but that baby ain't moving anywhere and neither am I.\"", "source": {"uri": "denofgeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Den of Geek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "louisa_mellor@denofgeek.com", "name": "Louisa Mellor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peaky Blinders (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Harper_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Harper (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cillian Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aeronauts_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Aeronauts (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oppenheimer (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historical drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romani people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Midlands (county)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Boys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Boys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Creed-Miles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Creed-Miles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Rundle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sophie Rundle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iddo_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iddo Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Multimedia", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Memorabilia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Memorabilia", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Peaky-Blinders-Series-6-Cillian-Murphy-Tommy-Shelby.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624911", "eventUri": "eng-9624911", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

He often seems dazed and not with it.\n\nPaul was seen walking the streets and chatting to locals this week with the filming of the Peaky Blinders movie set to start in September\n\nPaul hands some cash to a friend who he met at a local shop\n\nThis week Paul was also spotted picking up some Ribena, a can of fizzy pop and a pain au chocolat from a local shop\n\nMr Anderson was at a cashpoint at a local Tesco\n\nThe fashionably-dressed star looked a little worse for wear, witnesses said\n\nHe later sidled off with a companion on an electric scooter\n\nPaul Anderson playing Arthur Shelby. Makers of the show, which co-stars Oscar-nominated Cillian Murphy as Anderson's onscreen brother Tommy, are developing a feature-length movie this year... but will Paul be in it?\n\n'He's had arguments with people locally. He walks around making a lot of noise.\n\n'We are all very worried. He had a big argument in Tesco a few weeks ago.\n\nRead More Troubled Peaky Blinders star Paul Anderson's new career revealed as details about Netflix film adaptation of hit series are confirmed\n\n'He is living like he is on another planet. He's been in public topless. He struggles to walk.'\n\nThe friend added: 'It's a great concern. He looks out of control. It's tragic.'\n\nAnother said: 'He has been slowly looking worse over the months. He really stands out in the area. It's awful.'\n\nPhotos taken back in February rang alarm bells among fans and fellow actors.\n\nAnother local believes his condition has worsened since then.\n\nThey said: 'It's a real downward spiral. He has gotten worse in the last few weeks.'\n\nFans were left shocked after he was photographed shuffling out of his local bakery earlier this year.\n\nMr Anderson appeared gaunt and his face has become increasingly worn and creased over the past year.\n\nFriends say they are worried that Paul is unwell and struggling\n\nHe is potentially just a few months away from filming the final installment of Peaky Blinders\n\nThe actor is self-made, and his path to stardom began when he was a ticket tout outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium\n\nPaul had a pre-mixed can of G&T in his hand as he appeared to be on his phone\n\nHe was also seen on the phone before getting some cash out\n\nPaul 'looks out of control' sometimes, one friend said\n\nReal fears for his health has led to speculation that a much-anticipated return to playing Arthur Shelby could be under threat.\n\nMr Anderson is well known - and well liked in his area - but appears to be battling demons, friends said\n\nReal fears for his health has led to speculation that a much-anticipated return to playing Arthur Shelby could be under threat.\n\nHe looked thin and frail in February, just days after his co-star Cillian Murphy finally confirmed he would be willing to play Tommy Shelby in a Peaky Blinders movie.\n\nFilming is due to begin in September - but there is not confirmation that Mr Anderson will be there.\n\nPaul's own rags to riches tale is so extraordinary it could be from the pages of a Hollywood script.\n\nThe South Londoner, who is nicknamed Boycie like the wheeler dealer friend of Del Boy from Only Fools and Horses, had been making ends meet on the very edge of the law when he got his break around 15 years ago.\n\nAfter leaving school at 14 Paul wanted to be a lead singer in a band and made money working as a tout, which is illegal in the UK.\n\nBut a chance meeting with a film director outside Stamford Bridge where he was selling tickets for Chelsea versus Barcelona led to a big part in cult movie The Firm after the director said he found his touting 'exotic' and loved his rasping accent.\n\nFame and fortune followed, including a decade on Peaky Blinders and parts in Hollywood blockbusters including The Revenant with Leodardo DiCaprio and his close friend Tom Hardy, he he calls his 'brother'.\n\nPaul lives in a \u00a31.2million property in north London and is believed to be single. He has previously been linked to a jewellery designer Stephy Clark but their relationship status was never made public.\n\nHis breakthrough in acting came from his casting in football hooligan film The Firm, when a director found him touting tickets outrside Chelsea's football ground and changed his life\n\nAfter going to drama school, he also won a small part in Doctor Who (pictured)\n\nPaul Anderson, who plays Arthur Shelby in the hit BBC drama, was with a friend and a baby on Boxing Day when police found the Class A drug and a pipe used for smoking it. Sources have said his involvement in a Peaky Blinders movie could be in doubt\n\nPaui Anderson with actor and close friend Tom Hardy, who he starred with in The Revenant and Kray biopic Legend\n\nIn January it emerged that Anderson was arrested after a drinker at his local in Hampstead told the pub's manager he there was a smell of drug fumes coming from the disabled toilet after the actor walked out on Boxing Day.\n\nPaul was carrying a crack pipe but denied he was using it.\n\nPaul's big break came when he was on the wrong side of the law while touting tickets.\n\nHe was approached by Chelsea fan and film director Nick Love who wanted a seat for the Champions League game in 2008.\n\nAfter hearing his trademark gruff South London accent, Mr Love decided he was perfect for the part of football hooligan Bex in 2009 movie The Firm.\n\nDescribing what happened, Paul said in 2017: 'I happened to be outside and I was handling the odd ticket or two and sort of exchanging them for money. He was with a bunch of friends and I sold them \u00adtickets'.\n\nNick Love apparently found his touting 'exotic' and offered him a role in his upcoming film. The rest is history.\n\nPaul said: 'I earned a lot of money out of it [ticket touting] but that was all I got out of it'\n\nHe added 'I always wanted to be a \u00adfrontman in a band. Not a \u00adfootballer. Not an actor. Certainly not a policeman or a fireman'.\n\nBut it was an actor he became, quickly turning into a cult hero, especially for his part as a Shelby brother for ten years when that break came in 2013.\n\nDescribing his move into acting he said: 'I was inspired to attend drama school, so that's what I've done.\n\n'It was like going back to school for me. I left school very young; I left school when I was about 14, 15, so there was a large gap in my education. Going to drama school was like university that I never had'.\n\nHe says he understands why people 'love' his portrayal of Arthur Shelby, with some drawing comparisons between the two men.\n\nHe said: 'Lots of people say, 'We love Arthur,' and I don't know why. I guess I do understand. The thing I love about him and why I like playing him is he's not just this one-dimensional; he's tough and he can be violent and brutal, but he's not just that. He's got this inner turmoil, this dichotomy: 'I don't want to do this but I'm doing it because it's my life and it's the way things are.. He's not turning over a new leaf and being a god-fearing, pious, nice man; he's still suffering',\n\nPaui was spotted at hon day out in London in February after admitting to crack cocaine possession\n\nPaul Anderson is much loved by fans who hope he makes a recovery\n\nPaul with Tom Hardy, who he has described as being like a brother to him. They spent six months together filming The Revenant\n\nPaul Anderson playing Arthur Shelby. Anderson, who recently starred in Netflix film Lift, was expected to play a pivotal role in the Peaky Blinders movie, with production due to begin this summer\n\nNick Love enjoyed working with him so much he cast him in his film version of The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone.\n\nA Hollywood career beckoned, including appearances in a Sherlock Holmes movie with Robert Downey Jr and Hostiles with Christian Bale.\n\nHe also developed a strong bond with British megastar Tom Hardy, calling him his 'brother' after appearing with him in Legend and again in The Revenant with Leonardo DiCaprio and Mr Hardy.\n\nRecently he posted a picture of him and Hardy together on set as pictures of him looking frail in London emerged.\n\nHe wrote: 'My ears are burning @tomhardy' - but his friend did not respond publicly.\n\nUnder the picture one fan wrote: 'Take care of yourself - you have a lot of fans who care!'. Another said: 'You're so admired and loved by a crazy amount of people.... But right now, keep your circle small, focus on you, and please get well'.\n\nHis frail appearance came weeks after Paul pleaded guilty to crack cocaine and amphetamines possession after spending the day at the pub on Boxing Day in London.\n\nThe TV star was with a friend and a baby when police found the Class A drug and a pipe used for smoking it.\n\nPaul admitted possessing it, as well as class B amphetamines and two class C prescription substances, when he appeared in court in January.\n\nMoira MacFarlane, defending, said when Peaky Blinders fans recognised Anderson he could not resist slipping into the role of pugilistic hellraiser Arthur, who is frequently seen taking drugs on the show.\n\n'You will recognise the defendant from a very intense part that he has played in a recent television programme,' Ms MacFarlane told magistrates.\n\n'He is often recognised and does his best to please fans of the show by slipping into character. He was recognised that Boxing Day and tried to play up for these people. And because of the lifestyle he leads people often give him inducements.'\n\nMs MacFarlane insisted Anderson, who was fined a total of \u00a31,345, had not been smoking crack cocaine, but conceded: 'He has found himself in an unfortunate position and should have had the strength to say no.'\n\nHis breakthrough in acting came from his casting in The Firm\n\nPeaky Blinders characters Thomas Shelby (Cillian Murphy), John Shelby (Joe Cole), Arthur Shelby (Paul Anderson) - he admits to understanding why people love his character\n\nPaul Anderson barbecuing in the garden of his London home\n\nIt emerged in January that producers were investigating his conduct on set after a complaint from a colleague.\n\nIt is not known what the complaint related to but sources close to Anderson denied any wrong doing and told The Sun he was confident an investigation would clear him.\n\nAnderson, who recently starred in Netflix film Lift, was expected to play a pivotal role in the Peaky Blinders movie, with production due to begin this summer.\n\nThe drama set in Birmingham between the two world wars follows the rise of the criminal Shelby family.\n\nMakers of the show, which co-stars Oscar-nominated Cillian Murphy as Anderson's onscreen brother Tommy, are developing a feature-length climax but the conviction could have a 'significant impact' on the film, a source said last month.\n\n'[Screenwriter] Steven Knight is still writing the script,' the source said. 'But this conviction will create huge problems as it will be so hard to have a Peaky Blinders film without such a pivotal character, while it will be tough having him reprise the role as if nothing has happened'.\n\n'The third option would be to cancel the entire thing. I think it is most likely to go ahead and only Steven knows which characters will feature.'\n\nAnderson was caught after a drinker at his local in Hampstead, north-west London, told the pub's manager he smelled crack cocaine fumes coming from the disabled toilet after the actor walked out.\n\nThe manager at the pub called the police, who found 'intoxicated' Anderson nearby with a young man and a 17-month-old baby, Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court heard.\n\nHe was taken to a police station where officers found the crack cocaine, a wrap of brown powder found to be amphetamines plus diazepam and pregabalin, said prosecutor Kevin Kendridge.\n\nAnderson, who also appeared alongside Tom Hardy in the 2015 Kray brothers biopic Legend, answered 'no comment' to all questions during his interview but later tested positive for opiates and cocaine - not crack cocaine - the court heard.\n\nAnderson spoke only to enter the guilty pleas and confirm his identity and address at a \u00a31.2million mews property in north-west London.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's a gritty, decade-spanning drama that sees the dynasty contending with all manner of dangerous rivals.\n\nPeaky Blinders\" season 6 brought the series to an end back in 2022, but the Shelby story isn't over yet; we're currently waiting to learn more about the now-confirmed \"Peaky Blinders\" movie that's coming to Netflix.\n\nTo help ease that wait, here are five more shows like \"Peaky Blinders\" that we think you'll love.\n\nIf you're a fan of Steven Knight's work on \"Peaky Blinders\", then \"SAS Rogue Heroes\" (which he also created/wrote) will be a perfect fit. This explosive historical drama recounts the origins of the British Army's Special Air Service (SAS), one of the world's most famous Special Forces units, drawing on events as they are described in Ben Macintyre's 2016 book of the same name.\n\nThe World War Two drama takes us back to the Second World War and sees British Army officer David Stirling (played by \"Sex Education\" star Connor Swindells) forming the unit alongside fellow Lieutenants Paddy Mayne (Jack O'Connell) and Jock Lewes (Alfie Allen), before leading them behind enemy lines for their first missions in the Western Desert campaign. It's an action-packed, six-episode romp from start to finish.\n\nWatch on MGM Plus\n\nIf you want to watch another criminal empire unfold, \"Gangs of London\" should be your next port of call. This gritty, modern-day crime drama from Gareth Evans and Matt Flannery plays out like \"Game of Thrones\", inviting us to sit down with some of the most powerful criminals that operate out of the UK capital.\n\nThe story unfolds as Finn Wallace, the leader of the most powerful group, is assassinated, and his son Sean (\"Peaky Blinders\" alum Joe Cole) and the Dumani family scramble to take his place.\n\nNo one knows who killed Finn, but the upheaval ripples out and disturbs the balance of power amongst the many major players on the scene. And if that doesn't sound like enough drama, undercover police officer Elliot (Sope Dirisu) attempts to infiltrate the Organisation and ingratiate himself with their new leader. Be warned: Things get very violent, and it's not for the faint of heart.\n\nWatch on AMC Plus\n\nIf you decide you've spent enough time on the wrong side of the law but still want to watch another gritty British drama, \"Luther\" would be my top pick.\n\nThis crime thriller follows the exploits of Detective Chief Inspector John Luther (Idris Elba), a detective who is committed above all else to his job: finding and thwarting terrifying criminals and sadistic killers.\n\nYou can totally draw comparisons between Tommy Shelby and DCI Luther. Our detective is a complicated, and potentially dangerous figure. He's a man struggling with his own demons, and he isn't afraid to step over the thin blue line to put his targets behind bars. Terrifying and compelling in equal measure, \"Luther\" is compelling viewing. Once you've finished all five seasons, the sequel movie \"Luther: The Fallen Sun\" is available to stream on Netflix, too.\n\nWatch on Pluto TV or Prime Video (with a BritBox subscription)\n\nIf you were impressed by the glitz and glamor of Tommy Shelby's more successful years, or you were drawn in by Shelby's charisma, why not give \"Mad Men\" a try?\n\n\"Mad Men\" takes us inside the Sterling Cooper advertising agency office and introduces us to Jon Hamm's magnetic, gifted ad executive, Don Draper, the best man in the biz. It follows Draper and the rest of the agency as they struggle to stay on top. And when we're not in their boardrooms, the show turns the lens on the changing social dynamics of the 1960s, examining the personal and private lives of its many characters and their woes.\n\nCompelling and impeccably dressed, \"Mad Men\" is every bit as stylish as \"Peaky Blinders\", and is packed full of personal drama that will suit fans of the British hit.\n\nWatch on AMC Plus\n\nWhat can you say that's not already been said about \"The Sopranos\"? David Chase's HBO drama is routinely dubbed one of the best TV shows of all time, for good reason, and it's easy to see how this juggernaut of prestige TV must have influenced \"Peaky Blinders.\"\n\nIf you're yet to check it out, the series follows Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) as he juggles his role in the mafia with family life. Suffering from panic attacks, he starts attending therapy. It's an enthralling show, one which boasts top-tier writing, and amazing performances (especially Gandolfini's), and one of a quality that's still head and shoulders above countless others.",

BY ORDER OF CAMEO!'\n\nSeveral celebrities use Cameo including the likes of Strictly Come Dancing judge Anton Du Beke who charges \u00a394 per video, Harry Potter actress Bonnie Wright who charges \u00a3157 and Succession star Brian Cox wo charges \u00a3539.\n\nPaul recently sparked concern during an outing where he looked pale, gaunt and dishevelled while walking the streets close to his \u00a31.2million mews home.\n\nIt comes just months after he was caught with crack cocaine after a day in the pub. He was also found to have amphetamines, plus diazepam and pregabalin on him.\n\nOne local shopkeeper, who counts Anderson as a friend, told MailOnline: 'It's heartbreaking. He's a mess. But his erratic behaviour is causing real problems. He often seems dazed and not with it.\n\n'He's had arguments with people locally. He walks around making a lot of noise. We are all very worried. He had a big argument in Tesco a few weeks ago.\n\n'He is living like he is on another planet. He's been in public topless. He struggles to walk. It's a great concern. He looks out of control. It's tragic.'\n\nAnother said: 'He has been slowly looking worse over the months. He really stands out in the area. It's awful.'\n\nPaul, who plays Arthur Shelby in the BBC series, is charging fans \u00a3155 to record a video of himself for them\n\nPaul recently looked dishevelled as he walked the streets shirtless as 'concerned' friends fear he is on a 'downward spiral' just months before shooting begins for Peaky Blinders film\n\nDespite concerns for his health, Anderson appeared to be in good spirits as he called into a local shop, a protective leopard print face-mask pulled beneath his chin.\n\nReal fears for his health has led to speculation that a much-anticipated return to playing Arthur Shelby could be under threat.\n\nHe looked thin and frail in February, just days after his co-star Cillian Murphy finally confirmed he would be willing to play Tommy Shelby in a Peaky Blinders movie.\n\nFilming is due to begin in September - but there is not confirmation that Anderson will be there.\n\nHis own rags to riches tale is so extraordinary it could be from the pages of a Hollywood script.\n\nThe South Londoner, who is nicknamed Boycie like the wheeler dealer friend of Del Boy from Only Fools and Horses, had been making ends meet on the very edge of the law when he got his break around 15 years ago.\n\nAfter leaving school at 14, Anderson wanted to be a lead singer in a band and made money working as a tout, which is illegal in the UK.\n\nBut a chance meeting with a film director outside Stamford Bridge where he was selling tickets for Chelsea versus Barcelona led to a big part in cult movie The Firm after the director said he found his touting 'exotic' and loved his rasping accent.\n\nHis breakthrough in acting came from his casting in football hooligan film The Firm, when a director found him touting tickets outrside Chelsea's football ground and changed his life\n\nAfter going to drama school, he also won a small part in Doctor Who (pictured)\n\nFame and fortune followed, including a decade on Peaky Blinders and parts in Hollywood blockbusters including The Revenant with Leodardo DiCaprio and his close friend Tom Hardy, he he calls his 'brother'.\n\nAnderson lives in a \u00a31.2million property in north London and is believed to be single. He has previously been linked to a jewellery designer Stephy Clark but their relationship status was never made public.\n\nIn January it emerged that Anderson was arrested after a drinker at his local in Hampstead told the pub's manager he there was a smell of drug fumes coming from the disabled toilet after the actor walked out on Boxing Day.\n\nThe actor was carrying a crack pipe but denied he was using it.\n\nHe would play a pivotal role in any Peaky Blinders film if involved, but his drug conviction in January and allegations of bad behaviour on set could threaten his participation.\n\nYet despite his frailty, there are signs that he hasn't given up hope of reprising the role that made his name, with the actor responding to support from his Instagram followers.\n\nOne commented on a post: 'By order of The Peaky Blinders', to which Anderson replied: 'Forever'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

The show's popularity has continued to grow, so much so that a Peaky Blinders movie is currently in the works.\n\nFilming for the movie is due to begin in September, with the finished product coming out in due course. But ahead of the much-anticipated film being produced, concerns have been raised about Anderson's health and well-being.\n\nREAD MORE: Peaky Blinders star addresses new look as fans share concern as he gets 'back to business'\n\nREAD MORE: Join the Daily Star Soaps WhatsApp for all the latest spoilers and exclusives\n\nPictures that were taken recently showed the actor parading around his \u00a31.2million home in north London looking particularly haggard. He was also seen without a shirt on, leading many of his pals to be concerned he is on a \"downward spiral\".\n\nLooking out for their mate Paul, who has amassed a huge following since the show began airing on BBC One, a shopkeeper who described himself as being close to Paul said that things are going downhill for the star. He explained: \"It's heart-breaking, he's a mess.\n\n\"But his erratic behaviour is causing real problems; he often seems dazed and not with it,\" he said in an interview with MailOnline. \"He's had arguments with people locally - he walks around making a lot of noise.\"\n\nThe shopkeeper added: \"We are all very worried, he had a big argument in Tesco a few weeks ago. He is living like he is on another planet. He's been in public topless - he struggles to walk.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that Paul has hit back at concerns for his health. Back in February, Anderson spoke to his legions of followers after snaps of him looking worse for wear were published when he was seen leaving a bakery close to his luxury pad.\n\nThe incident came just weeks after Paul pleaded guilty to drug possession charges after officers discovered he was holding crack cocaine, amphetamines and prescription medication. In a message to fans following the debacle, he thanked his fans for their worries and concerns, but assured them things would be okay.\n\nCaptioning a snap of himself in the back of a car, he wrote: \"Thank you for all your love and concern to everybody. I was and have been absolutely flattened by the flu. I also want to take time to thank each and every one of you all over the world for all the messages of love and support - I see you and appreciate it humbly and sincerely.\n\n\"Always remember nobody cares about the truth when the lie is way more entertaining than the truth,\" he added. \"I am back don't you worry about that.\"\n\nThe new Peaky Blinders film - which will be set in the Shelby's hometown of Birmingham - will begin production in September. Lead actor Cillian Murphy, who plays the notorious Tommy Shelby in the show, has been confirmed to be reprising his role once again.\n\nFor more of the latest showbiz and TV news from the Daily Star, make sure you sign up for one of our newsletters here.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rory_gannon@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Rory Gannon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Anderson_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Anderson (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peaky Blinders (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MailOnline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MailOnline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Star_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Star (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cillian Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crack cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32965254.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_18333977-high-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624911", "eventUri": "eng-9624911", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

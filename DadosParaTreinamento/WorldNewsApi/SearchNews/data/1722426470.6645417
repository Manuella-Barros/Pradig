Therefore, especially vulnerable groups should be informed on how to protect themselves from the risk of heatstroke, particularly the elderly, individuals with underlying health conditions, and children, primarily due to their less effective heat dissipation systems. Sweating is the primary method the body uses to expel heat, capable of producing up to two liters of sweat per hour in heat. However, when the environmental temperature exceeds the body\u2019s temperature, the body faces additional challenges in its effort to stay cool. Other significant methods the body uses to maintain temperature include vasodilation, which increases blood flow to the skin to aid in removing heat from vital organs and maintaining core temperature around 37\u00b0C. However, despite the effectiveness of sweating and vasodilation, their ability to cool the body is limited during prolonged high temperatures. Dr. Adam Taylor, Professor and Director of the Clinical Anatomy Learning Centre at Lancaster University, provides valuable advice on how to cope with high temperatures and keep the body cool. Keep the body cool Applying cold water to the skin effectively removes heat from the body. A shower at a temperature of about 26 or 27\u00b0C is cool enough to dissipate heat but not so cold as to induce shivering, which generates heat (ice-cold water can cause cold shock). A cold compress or towel can achieve similar results. Areas such as the groin, armpits, neck, forehead, wrists, and torso have many blood vessels close to the surface. Placing these items on these areas allows the cooled blood to return to the vital organs, helping to lower the core temperature. Drink cold and hot beverages Consuming hot beverages activates the body\u2019s cooling mechanism, but it can also dehydrate the body if not sufficiently hydrated, notes the professor. Therefore, cold beverages are generally better in this case. Additionally, data from performance athletes exercising in 28\u00b0C temperatures showed that cold liquids at refrigerator temperature were better at reducing core body temperature than ice. Stay in the shade If you try these in the sun, they are likely to be less effective, as the ambient air is warmer in the sun, meaning there is less ability to dissipate heat or it happens more slowly. Ultimately, the most effective way to cool down and prevent heatstroke is with ice-cold water: either by dipping hands and feet only or by taking a shower. However, if you cannot do this, a fan is the next effective strategy.", "summary": "High temperatures started early this year and seem set to continue throughout the summer, accompanied by heatwaves.

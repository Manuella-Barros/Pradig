NHS staff at King's College Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' (including the Royal Brompton and the Evelina London Children's Hospital) and primary care services in the capital say pathology partner Synnovis was hit by a \"major IT incident\".\n\nSynnovis is a provider of pathology services and was formed from a partnership between SynLab UK & Ireland, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nThe memos said the \"critical incident\" has had a \"major impact\" on the delivery of services, with blood transfusions particularly affected.\n\nSome procedures and operations have been cancelled or have been redirected to other NHS providers as hospital bosses continue to establish what work can be carried out safely.\n\nOne patient, Oliver Dowson, 70, was prepared for an operation from 6am on Monday June 3 at Royal Brompton when he was told by a surgeon at about 12.30pm that it would not be going ahead.\n\nHe told the PA news agency: \"The staff on the ward didn't seem to know what had happened, just that many patients were being told to go home and wait for a new date.\n\n\"I've been given a date for next Tuesday and am crossing my fingers - it's not the first time that they have cancelled, they did it on May 28 too, but that was probably staff shortages in half-term week.\"\n\nA spokesman for King's College Hospital in London confirmed it was affected by the attack.\n\nAll hospitals have been approached for comment.\n\nAccording to the Health Service Journal (HSJ), several senior sources have told it the system has been the victim of a ransomware attack.\n\nOne said gaining access to pathology results could take \"weeks, not days\".\n\nThere are suggestions that urgent and emergency care at the hospitals will be affected as they may not be able to access quick-turnaround blood test results.\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that SynLab would partner with the NHS to deliver pathology services at hospitals and GP services across south-east London.\n\nAs well as serving King's, and Guys' and St Thomas', the pathology service also caters for South London and Maudsley and Oxleas NHS Foundation Trusts and a number of GP practices, clinics and other community services across the boroughs of Bromley, Lambeth and Southwark.\n\nPathology services help with the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and infections by analysing samples including blood and tissue.\n\nA spokesperson for NHS England London region said: \"On Monday 3 June Synnovis, a provider of lab services, was the victim of a ransomware cyber attack.\n\n\"This is having a significant impact on the delivery of services at Guy's and St Thomas', King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trusts and primary care services in south east London and we apologise for the inconvenience this is causing to patients and their families.\n\n\"Emergency care continues to be available, so patients should access services in the normal way by dialling 999 in an emergency and otherwise using 111, and patients should continue to attend appointments unless they are told otherwise.\n\n\"We will continue to provide updates for local patients and the public about the impact on services and how they can continue to get the care they need.\"We are working urgently to fully understand the impact of the incident with the support of the government's National Cyber Security Centre and our Cyber Operations team.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nMajor hospitals in London have declared a critical incident after a cyber attack led to operations being cancelled and patients being diverted elsewhere for care.\n\nNHS officials said they were working with the National Cyber Security Centre after the attack on Synnovis, which provides pathology services to large hospitals and GP surgeries in the capital.\n\nThe company said the ransomware attack has affected all of its IT systems, which has impacted its pathology services.\n\nSome procedures and operations have been cancelled or have been redirected to other NHS providers as hospital bosses continue to establish what work can be carried out safely.\n\nHealth service leaders said there has been a \"significant impact\" King's College Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' - including the Royal Brompton and the Evelina London Children's Hospital - and GP services in south-east London.\n\nA memo to staff said the \"critical incident\" has had a \"major impact\" on the delivery of services, with blood transfusions particularly affected.\n\nPatients have described last-minute cancellations to operations and blood tests.\n\nOliver Dowson, 70, was prepared for an operation from 6am on June 3 at Royal Brompton when he was told by a surgeon at about 12.30pm that it would not be going ahead.\n\nHe told the PA news agency: \"The staff on the ward didn't seem to know what had happened, just that many patients were being told to go home and wait for a new date.\n\n\"I've been given a date for next Tuesday and am crossing my fingers - it's not the first time that they have cancelled, they did it on May 28 too, but that was probably staff shortages in half-term week.\"\n\nVanessa Welham, from Streatham in south-west London, said that her husband's blood test at Gracefield Gardens health centre was cancelled on Monday evening and he was informed that local centres were not taking bookings for an \"indefinite period of time\".\n\nShe told PA: \"My husband received a text message last night advising his appointment this morning had been cancelled due to circumstances beyond their control, and that all major south London hospitals - King's, St Thomas', Guys, Evalina and Gracefield Gardens - are unable to take any bookings for an indefinite period of time.\n\n\"He went on to the Swift website and made a new appointment - the earliest available was June 17, but that's probably questionable.\"\n\nA spokesman for NHS England London region said: \"On Monday June 3 Synnovis, a provider of lab services, was the victim of a ransomware cyber attack.\n\n\"This is having a significant impact on the delivery of services at Guy's and St Thomas', King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trusts and primary care services in south-east London, and we apologise for the inconvenience this is causing to patients and their families.\n\n\"Emergency care continues to be available, so patients should access services in the normal way by dialling 999 in an emergency and otherwise using 111, and patients should continue to attend appointments unless they are told otherwise.\n\n\"We will continue to provide updates for local patients and the public about the impact on services and how they can continue to get the care they need.\n\n\"We are working urgently to fully understand the impact of the incident with the support of the government's National Cyber Security Centre and our cyber operations team.\"\n\nSynnovis chief executive Mark Dollar confirmed the company had been victim of a ransomware cyberattack, adding: \"This has affected all Synnovis IT systems, resulting in interruptions to many of our pathology services.\n\n\"It is still early days and we are trying to understand exactly what has happened. A taskforce of IT experts from Synnovis and the NHS is working to fully assess the impact this has had, and to take the appropriate action needed.\n\n\"Regrettably, this is affecting patients, with some activity already cancelled or redirected to other providers as urgent work is prioritised.\n\n\"We are incredibly sorry for the inconvenience and upset this is causing to patients, service users and anyone else affected. We are doing our best to minimise the impact and will stay in touch with local NHS services to keep people up to date with developments.\n\n\"We take cyber security very seriously at Synnovis and have invested heavily in ensuring our IT arrangements are as safe as they possibly can be. This is a harsh reminder that this sort of attack can happen to anyone at any time and that, dispiritingly, the individuals behind it have no scruples about who their actions might affect.\n\n\"The incident is being reported to law enforcement and the Information Commissioner, and we are working with the National Cyber Security Centre and the Cyber Operations Team.\"\n\nSenior health services sources have told the Health Service Journal (HSJ), that gaining access to pathology results could take \"weeks, not days\".\n\nSynnovis was formed from a partnership between SynLab UK and Ireland, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that SynLab would partner with the NHS to deliver pathology services at hospitals and GP services across south-east London.\n\nAs well as serving King's and Guys' and St Thomas', the pathology service also caters for South London and Maudsley and Oxleas NHS Foundation Trusts and a number of GP practices, clinics and other community services across the boroughs of Southwark, Lambeth, Bromley, Bexley, Greenwich and Lewisham.\n\nPathology services help with the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and infections by analysing samples including blood and tissue.\n\nCommenting on the attack, cyber security expert, Steve Sands, of BCS - the Chartered Institute for IT, said: \"This incident reminds us that the ransomware threat is now an ever-present danger to critical institutions from schools to hospitals.\n\n\"Of course, the perpetrators have no conscience, and they will attack any organisation whose cyber defences are not sufficiently robust.\n\n\"We need to ensure that all public sector organisations have contingency plans in place to manage cyber attacks, that staff are regularly trained on risk and there is sufficient investment in software resilience.\n\n\"Whoever forms the next government needs to make sure the NHS has this resource and that it is spent correctly, to ensure that lives are not put at risk.\"\n\nProfessor Awais Rashid, head of the Bristol Cyber Security Group at the University of Bristol, added: \"Digital infrastructures on which critical services, such as those provided by the NHS, rely are often a complex combination of many different systems and third-party service providers. Hence, cyber-attacks can have significant and substantial cascading impacts as we are seeing in this unfolding situation where critical health services are being impacted.\n\n\"There are myriad intersections of complex technology stacks and software and service supply chains. Attackers are increasingly targeting these elements leading to wide ranging disruptions to key societal functions.\n\n\"We need ways to ensure that critical services such as healthcare continue to operate safely and reliably even when parts of the infrastructure are under attack or compromised.\"\n\nA Government spokesperson said: \"Patient safety is our priority and the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and the National Cyber Security Centre are working together to investigate impacts from a cyber incident affecting a pathology provider.\n\n\"Support is being provided to the company and we are working with them to minimise the impact on services for a number of NHS organisations in south-east London.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

A taskforce of IT experts from Synnovis and the NHS is working to fully assess the impact this has had, and to take the appropriate action needed.\n\n\"Regrettably, this is affecting patients, with some activity already cancelled or redirected to other providers as urgent work is prioritised.\n\n\"We are incredibly sorry for the inconvenience and upset this is causing to patients, service users and anyone else affected. We are doing our best to minimise the impact and will stay in touch with local NHS services to keep people up to date with developments.\n\n\"We take cyber security very seriously at Synnovis and have invested heavily in ensuring our IT arrangements are as safe as they possibly can be. This is a harsh reminder that this sort of attack can happen to anyone at any time and that, dispiritingly, the individuals behind it have no scruples about who their actions might affect.\n\n\"The incident is being reported to law enforcement and the Information Commissioner, and we are working with the National Cyber Security Centre and the Cyber Operations Team.\"\n\nSenior health services sources have told the Health Service Journal (HSJ), that gaining access to pathology results could take \"weeks, not days\".\n\nSynnovis was formed from a partnership between SynLab UK and Ireland, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that SynLab would partner with the NHS to deliver pathology services at hospitals and GP services across south-east London.\n\nAs well as serving King's and Guys' and St Thomas', the pathology service also caters for South London and Maudsley and Oxleas NHS Foundation Trusts and a number of GP practices, clinics and other community services across the boroughs of Southwark, Lambeth, Bromley, Bexley, Greenwich and Lewisham.\n\nPathology services help with the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and infections by analysing samples including blood and tissue.\n\nCommenting on the attack, cyber security expert, Steve Sands, of BCS - the Chartered Institute for IT, said: \"This incident reminds us that the ransomware threat is now an ever-present danger to critical institutions from schools to hospitals.\n\n\"Of course, the perpetrators have no conscience, and they will attack any organisation whose cyber defences are not sufficiently robust.\n\n\"We need to ensure that all public sector organisations have contingency plans in place to manage cyber attacks, that staff are regularly trained on risk and there is sufficient investment in software resilience.\n\n\"Whoever forms the next government needs to make sure the NHS has this resource and that it is spent correctly, to ensure that lives are not put at risk.\"\n\nProfessor Awais Rashid, head of the Bristol Cyber Security Group at the University of Bristol, added: \"Digital infrastructures on which critical services, such as those provided by the NHS, rely are often a complex combination of many different systems and third-party service providers. Hence, cyber-attacks can have significant and substantial cascading impacts as we are seeing in this unfolding situation where critical health services are being impacted.\n\n\"There are myriad intersections of complex technology stacks and software and service supply chains. Attackers are increasingly targeting these elements leading to wide ranging disruptions to key societal functions.\n\n\"We need ways to ensure that critical services such as healthcare continue to operate safely and reliably even when parts of the infrastructure are under attack or compromised.\"\n\nA Government spokesperson said: \"Patient safety is our priority and the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and the National Cyber Security Centre are working together to investigate impacts from a cyber incident affecting a pathology provider.\n\n\"Support is being provided to the company and we are working with them to minimise the impact on services for a number of NHS organisations in south-east London.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title":

affected.\n\nMajor hospitals in London have declared a critical incident after a cyber attack led to the cancellation of operations and the loss of blood transfusions.\n\nMemos to NHS staff at King's College Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' (including the Royal Brompton and the Evelina London Children's Hospital) and primary care services in the capital say pathology partner Synnovis was hit by a \"major IT incident\".\n\nSynnovis is a provider of pathology services and was formed from a partnership between SynLab UK & Ireland, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nThe memos said the \"critical incident\" has had a \"major impact\" on the delivery of services, with blood transfusions particularly affected.\n\nSome procedures and operations have been cancelled or have been redirected to other NHS providers as hospital bosses continue to establish what work can be carried out safely.\n\nOne patient, Oliver Dowson, 70, was prepared for an operation from 6am on Monday June 3 at Royal Brompton when he was told by a surgeon at about 12.30pm that it would not be going ahead.\n\nHe told the PA news agency: \"The staff on the ward didn't seem to know what had happened, just that many patients were being told to go home and wait for a new date.\n\n\"I've been given a date for next Tuesday and am crossing my fingers - it's not the first time that they have cancelled, they did it on May 28 too, but that was probably staff shortages in half-term week.\"\n\nVanessa Welham from Streatham, south west London, said that her husband's blood test at Gracefield Gardens health centre was cancelled on Monday evening and he was informed that local centres were not taking bookings for an \"indefinite period of time\".\n\nShe told PA: \"My husband received a text message last night advising his appointment this morning had been cancelled due to circumstances beyond their control, and that all major south London hospitals - King's, St Thomas', Guys, Evalina and Gracefield Gardens - are unable to take any bookings for an indefinite period of time.\n\n\"He went on to the Swift website and made a new appointment - the earliest available was June 17, but that's probably questionable.\"\n\nA spokesman for King's College Hospital in London confirmed it was affected by the attack.\n\nAll hospitals have been approached for comment.\n\nAccording to the Health Service Journal (HSJ), several senior sources have told it the system has been the victim of a ransomware attack.\n\nOne said gaining access to pathology results could take \"weeks, not days\".\n\nThere are suggestions that urgent and emergency care at the hospitals will be affected as they may not be able to access quick-turnaround blood test results.\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that SynLab would partner with the NHS to deliver pathology services at hospitals and GP services across south-east London.\n\nAs well as serving King's and Guys' and St Thomas', the pathology service also caters for South London and Maudsley and Oxleas NHS Foundation Trusts and a number of GP practices, clinics and other community services across the boroughs of Bromley, Lambeth and Southwark.\n\nPathology services help with the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and infections by analysing samples including blood and tissue.", "source": {"uri":

Email elizabeth.haigh@mailonline.co.uk\n\nThe NHS cyber attack could last for weeks, experts have warned, as it is revealed that GP surgeries in six London boroughs have been crippled by the same attack which led to operations and blood transfusions being cancelled.\n\nThe NHS earlier declared a 'critical incident' after hackers first hit London hospitals on Monday, affected Guy's and St Thomas' and King's College Hospital Trusts.\n\nNow it has been revealed that in addition to cancelling potentially life-saving surgeries, the hack has also caused havoc at GP surgeries across six London boroughs.\n\nGP surgeries in boroughs with a combined population of at least 1.8 million people are impacted: Bexley, Greenwich, Lewisham, Bromley, Southwark and Lambeth.\n\nIt is understood IT system Synnovis, which serves NHS pathology labs, was the target of the attack.\n\nA senior source told the Health Service Journal (HSJ) that accessing pathology results could now take 'weeks, not days'.\n\nThe attack, which first hit London hospitals on Monday, is affecting Guy's, St Thomas', Brompton, Harfield and King's College Hospital Trusts\n\nIt is understood IT system Synnovis, which serves NHS pathology labs, was the target of the attack\n\nIt was earlier reported that hospital staff are being forced to cancel key surgeries or send patients to other facilities at short notice, with the attack particularly affecting transfusion services.\n\nThe Royal Brompton and Harefield have had to cancel potentially life-saving transplant operations, with Evelina London Children's Hospital also affected.\n\nA spokesman for King's College Hospital in London confirmed it was affected by the cyber attack which is reported to have hit several NHS trusts in the capital.\n\nThe incident meant some departments could not connect to their main server.\n\nIn a letter to staff, King's said the 'major IT incident' was having a major impact on the delivery of services, with blood transfusions particularly affected.\n\nAccording to the Health Service Journal (HSJ), several senior sources have told it the system has been the victim of a ransomware attack.\n\nOne said gaining access to pathology results could take 'weeks, not days'.\n\nThere are suggestions urgent and emergency care at the hospitals will be affected as they may not be able to access quick-turnaround blood test results.\n\nAn email sent to staff at Guy's and St Thomas' said doctors should only order key tests - including blood tests and swabs - if 'clinically urgent'.\n\nAnother states blood will only be issued to 'urgent' cases who have a 'critical' need.\n\nReverend Mandy MacVean told MailOnline her 18-month-old grandson had been due to have a kidney transplant, donated by his mother, at the Evelina Children's Hospital on Wednesday, but it has now been cancelled.\n\nShe said: 'The family have gone to the hospital today and have now been told that both operations are cancelled due to the cyber attack.\n\nTransplant surgeries at the Royal Brompton (pictured) have reportedly been cancelled\n\n'These operations only take place once a month so they now have to wait until July.\n\n'Apart from the baby now having to return to daily dialysis, my son and daughter in law have taken time off work for this operation.\n\n'They also have a three-year-old whose world has already been turned upside down by his baby brother's condition. This attack could not have come on a worse day.'\n\nKatie Al Nasser's mother was due to have a nine-hour operation on a cancerous tumour at King's College hospital today.\n\nThat was also cancelled, with staff informing the family it was due to 'low blood transfusion levels.'\n\nVanessa Welham from Streatham, south west London, said that her husband's blood test at Gracefield Gardens health centre was cancelled on Monday evening and he was informed that local centres were not taking bookings for an 'indefinite period of time'.\n\nShe said: 'My husband received a text message last night advising his appointment this morning had been cancelled due to circumstances beyond their control, and that all major south London hospitals - King's, St Thomas', Guys, Evalina and Gracefield Gardens - are unable to take any bookings for an indefinite period of time.\n\n'He went on to the Swift website and made a new appointment - the earliest available was June 17, but that's probably questionable.'\n\nOne patient, Oliver Dowson, 70, was prepared for an operation from 6am on Monday June 3 at Royal Brompton when he was told by a surgeon at about 12.30pm that it would not be going ahead.\n\nHe said: 'The staff on the ward didn't seem to know what had happened, just that many patients were being told to go home and wait for a new date.\n\n'I've been given a date for next Tuesday and am crossing my fingers - it's not the first time that they have cancelled, they did it on May 28 too, but that was probably staff shortages in half-term week.'\n\nAn email seen by The Mirror read: 'This is having a major impact on the delivery of our services, with blood transfusions being particularly affected.\n\n'Some activity has already been cancelled or redirected to other providers at short notice as we prioritise the clinical work that we are able to safely carry out.'\n\nIt added: 'While we do not yet know all the details or how long this issue will take to resolve we will keep you updated through the usual routes, including through the clinical alert system.'\n\nThe system targeted by hackers, Synnovis, is run by SYNLAB UK & Ireland and performs more than 32 million pathology tests a year.\n\nThe company says it serves 1.7 million people in southeast London each year as it collaborates with the two affected NHS hospital trusts.\n\nNHS officials said they were working with the National Cyber Security Centre to understand the impact of the ransomware cyber attack affecting some London hospitals.\n\nA spokesperson for NHS England London region said: 'On Monday June 3 Synnovis, a provider of lab services, was the victim of a ransomware cyber attack.\n\n'This is having a significant impact on the delivery of services at Guy's and St Thomas', King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trusts and primary care services in south-east London and we apologise for the inconvenience this is causing to patients and their families.\n\n'Emergency care continues to be available, so patients should access services in the normal way by dialling 999 in an emergency and otherwise using 111, and patients should continue to attend appointments unless they are told otherwise. We will continue to provide updates for local patients and the public about the impact on services and how they can continue to get the care they need.\n\n'We are working urgently to fully understand the impact of the incident with the support of the government's National Cyber Security Centre and our cyber operations team.'\n\nA government spokesperson said: 'The Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and the National Cyber Security Centre are working together to investigate a cyber incident affecting a number of NHS organisations in South East London.\n\n'Patient safety is our priority and support is being offered to the impacted organisations.'\n\nIn a statement confirming the attack, Mark Dollar, Synnovis CEO said: 'On Monday 3 June, Synnovis - a partnership between two London-based hospital Trusts and SYNLAB - was the victim of a ransomware cyberattack. This has affected all Synnovis IT systems, resulting in interruptions to many of our pathology services.\n\n'It is still early days and we are trying to understand exactly what has happened. A taskforce of IT experts from Synnovis and the NHS is working to fully assess the impact this has had, and to take the appropriate action needed.\n\n'We are working closely with NHS Trust partners to minimise the impact on patients and other service users.\n\n'Regrettably this is affecting patients, with some activity already cancelled or redirected to other providers as urgent work is prioritised.\n\n'We are incredibly sorry for the inconvenience and upset this is causing to patients, service users and anyone else affected. We are doing our best to minimise the impact and will stay in touch with local NHS services to keep people up to date with developments.\n\n'We take cybersecurity very seriously at Synnovis and have invested heavily in ensuring our IT arrangements are as safe as they possibly can be.\n\n'This is a harsh reminder that this sort of attack can happen to anyone at any time and that, dispiritingly, the individuals behind it have no scruples about who their actions might affect.\n\n'The incident is being reported to law enforcement and the Information Commissioner, and we are working with the National Cyber Security Centre and the Cyber Operations Team.\n\n'We will share further updates as we know more, but regret that we are unable to respond to individual queries from the media at this time - thank you for your understanding.'\n\nNHS England has been contacted for comment.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

redirected to other NHS providers as hospital bosses continue to establish what work can be carried out safely.\n\nNHS officials said they were working with the National Cyber Security Centre to understand the impact of the ransomware cyber attack.\n\nA spokesman for NHS England London region said: \"On Monday June 3 Synnovis, a provider of lab services, was the victim of a ransomware cyber attack.\n\n\"This is having a significant impact on the delivery of services at Guy's and St Thomas', King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trusts and primary care services in south-east London, and we apologise for the inconvenience this is causing to patients and their families.\n\n\"Emergency care continues to be available, so patients should access services in the normal way by dialling 999 in an emergency and otherwise using 111, and patients should continue to attend appointments unless they are told otherwise.\n\n\"We will continue to provide updates for local patients and the public about the impact on services and how they can continue to get the care they need.\n\n\"We are working urgently to fully understand the impact of the incident with the support of the government's National Cyber Security Centre and our cyber operations team.\"\n\nOne patient, Oliver Dowson, 70, was prepared for an operation from 6am on Monday June 3 at Royal Brompton when he was told by a surgeon at about 12:30pm that it would not be going ahead.\n\nHe told the PA news agency: \"The staff on the ward didn't seem to know what had happened, just that many patients were being told to go home and wait for a new date.\n\n\"I've been given a date for next Tuesday and am crossing my fingers - it's not the first time that they have cancelled, they did it on May 28 too, but that was probably staff shortages in half-term week.\"\n\nVanessa Welham from Streatham, south west London, said that her husband's blood test at Gracefield Gardens health centre was cancelled on Monday evening and he was informed that local centres were not taking bookings for an \"indefinite period of time\".\n\nShe told PA: \"My husband received a text message last night advising his appointment this morning had been cancelled due to circumstances beyond their control, and that all major south London hospitals - King's, St Thomas', Guys, Evalina and Gracefield Gardens - are unable to take any bookings for an indefinite period of time.\n\n\"He went on to the Swift website and made a new appointment - the earliest available was June 17, but that's probably questionable.\"\n\nA spokesman for King's College Hospital in London confirmed it was affected by the attack.\n\nAll hospitals have been approached for comment.\n\nAccording to the Health Service Journal (HSJ), several senior sources have told it the system has been the victim of a ransomware attack.\n\nOne said gaining access to pathology results could take \"weeks, not days\".\n\nThere are suggestions that urgent and emergency care at the hospitals will be affected as they may not be able to access quick-turnaround blood test results.\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that SynLab would partner with the NHS to deliver pathology services at hospitals and GP services across south-east London.\n\nAs well as serving King's and Guys' and St Thomas', the pathology service also caters for South London and Maudsley and Oxleas NHS

been hit by a \"major IT incident\" involving pathology partner Synnovis, the letters said.\n\nSynnovis is a provider of pathology services and was formed from a partnership between SYNLAB UK & Ireland, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nTrusts reported that the incident has had a \"major impact\" on the delivery of services, with blood transfusions particularly affected.\n\nSome procedures have been cancelled or have been redirected to other NHS providers as hospital bosses continue to establish what work can be carried out safely.\n\nOne patient, Oliver Dowson, 70, was prepared for an operation from 6am on Monday June 3, at Royal Brompton when he was told by a surgeon at about 12.30 that it would not be going

date for next Tuesday and am crossing my fingers - it's not the first time that they have cancelled, they did it on May 28 too, but that was probably staff shortages in half term week.\"\n\nA spokesman for King's College Hospital in London confirmed it was affected by the attack.\n\nThe incident is thought to have occurred on Monday, meaning some departments could not connect to a main server.\n\nAccording to the Health Service Journal (HSJ), several senior sources have told it the system has been the victim of a ransomware attack.\n\nOne said gaining access to pathology results could take \"weeks, not days\".\n\nThere are suggestions urgent and emergency care at the hospitals will be affected as they may not be able to access quick-turnaround blood test results.\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that SynLab would partner with the NHS to deliver pathology services at hospitals and GP services across South East London.\n\nAs well as serving King's and Guys' and St Thomas', the

A taskforce of IT experts from Synnovis and the NHS is working to fully assess the impact this has had, and to take the appropriate action needed.\n\n\"Regrettably, this is affecting patients, with some activity already cancelled or redirected to other providers as urgent work is prioritised.\n\n\"We are incredibly sorry for the inconvenience and upset this is causing to patients, service users and anyone else affected. We are doing our best to minimise the impact and will stay in touch with local NHS services to keep people up to date with developments.\n\n\"We take cyber security very seriously at Synnovis and have invested heavily in ensuring our IT arrangements are as safe as they possibly can be. This is a harsh reminder that this sort of attack can happen to anyone at any time and that, dispiritingly, the individuals behind it have no scruples about who their actions might affect.\n\n\"The incident is being reported to law enforcement and the Information Commissioner, and we are working with the National Cyber Security Centre and the Cyber Operations Team.\"\n\nSynnovis was formed from a partnership between SynLab UK and Ireland, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that SynLab would partner with the NHS to deliver pathology services at hospitals and GP services across south-east London.\n\nAs well as serving King's and Guys' and St Thomas', the pathology service also caters for South London and Maudsley and Oxleas NHS Foundation Trusts and a number of GP practices, clinics and other community services across the boroughs of Southwark, Lambeth, Bromley, Bexley, Greenwich and Lewisham.\n\nPathology services help with the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and infections by analysing samples including blood and tissue.\n\nCommenting on the attack, cyber security expert, Steve Sands, of BCS - the Chartered Institute for IT, said: \"This incident reminds us that the ransomware threat is now an ever-present danger to critical institutions from schools to hospitals.\n\n\"Of course, the perpetrators have no conscience, and they will attack any organisation whose cyber defences are not sufficiently robust.\n\n\"We need to ensure that all public sector organisations have contingency plans in place to manage cyber attacks, that staff are regularly trained on risk and there is sufficient investment in software resilience.\n\n\"Whoever forms the next government needs to make sure the NHS has this resource and that it is spent correctly, to ensure that lives are not put at risk.\"\n\nProfessor Awais Rashid, head of the Bristol Cyber Security Group at the University of Bristol, added: \"Digital infrastructures on which critical services, such as those provided by the NHS, rely are often a complex combination of many different systems and third-party service providers. Hence, cyber-attacks can have significant and substantial cascading impacts as we are seeing in this unfolding situation where critical health services are being impacted.\n\n\"There are myriad intersections of complex technology stacks and software and service supply chains. Attackers are increasingly targeting these elements leading to wide ranging disruptions to key societal functions.\n\n\"We need ways to ensure that critical services such as healthcare continue to operate safely and reliably even when parts of the infrastructure are under attack or compromised.\"\n\nA Government spokesperson said: \"Patient safety is our priority and the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and the National Cyber Security Centre are working together to investigate impacts from a cyber incident affecting a pathology provider.\n\n\"Support is being provided to the company and we are working with them to minimise the impact on services for a number of NHS organisations in south-east London.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news",

Hospital Foundation Trust and Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals Foundation Trusts and GP services across South London, have been hit by a ransomware attack, according to emails seen by The Independent.\n\nSynnovis is the supplier of blood tests, swabs, bowel tests and other services for hospitals serving NHS patients across six London boroughs.\n\nThe supplier covers Guy's Hospital, which runs children's hospital the Evelina, Harefield Hospital, King's College Hospital, Princess Royal University Hospital, Royal Brompton Hospital and St Thomas' Hospital.\n\nSynnovis warned the NHS trusts on Monday that it had been hit by a major malware attack, impacting tens of thousands of patients, according to sources close to the hospitals.\n\nIn a second email on Tuesday, seen by The Independent, it confirmed it has been hit by a ransomware attack.\n\nGPs have been told to cancel all non-emergency pathology appointments, while hospital staff have been told to request emergency blood samples only for patients who require transfusions.\n\nThe National Cyber Security Center is now involved, while NHS England has declared a level three incident - the second highest alert level.\n\nIn a message to staff on Monday, Guy's and St Thomas' said: \"Synnovis, the pathology provider for both King's and Guy's and St Thomas', informed us of a major incident with ICT systems.\"\n\nA senior NHS source told The Independent that transplants have been impacted as patients cannot have their blood tests crosschecked and that healthcare leaders in London have been warned the incident could take \"weeks or months\" to resolve.\n\nIn a separate message, Synnovis said there would be delays for patients receiving results, and GPs have been asked to cancel all non-urgent blood test appointments.\n\n\"Given the nature and magnitude of this attack, this is an evolving situation,\" it said.\n\nThe emails say it is unclear how long the issue will last.\n\nIn the second email, Synnovis told staff: \"This is a harsh reminder that this sort of attack can happen to anyone at any time and that, dispiritingly, the individuals behind it have no scruples about who their actions affect.\n\n\"This incident is being reported to law enforcement and the Information Commissioner, and we are working with the National Cyber Security Centre and the Cyber Operations Team.\"\n\nThe National Cyber Security Centre and the National Crime Agency have been contacted for comment.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"The Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and the National Cyber Security Centre are working together to investigate a cyber incident affecting a number of NHS organisations in South East London.\n\n\"Patient safety is our priority and support is being offered to the impacted organisations.\"\n\nA spokesperson for NHS England London region said: \"On Monday 3 June Synnovis, a provider of lab services, was the victim of a ransomware

and we apologise for the inconvenience this is causing to patients and their families.\n\n\"We are working urgently to fully understand the impact of the incident with the support of the government's

We will continue to provide updates for local patients and the public about the impact on services and how they can continue to get the care they need.\n\n\"We are working urgently to fully understand the impact of the incident with the support of the government's National Cyber Security Centre and our Cyber Operations team.\"\n\nThe situation was officially declared a \"critical incident\" on Tuesday morning, according to emails and memos sent to staff at affected hospitals, leaked by The Sunday Times.\n\n\"I can confirm that our pathology partner Synnovis experienced a major IT incident earlier today, which is ongoing and means that we are not currently connected to the Synnovis IT servers,\" Ian Abbs, CEO at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, wrote in one email.\n\n\"This is having a major impact on the delivery of our services, with blood transfusions being particularly affected. Some activity has already been cancelled or redirected to other providers at short notice as we prioritize the clinical that we are able to carry out.\n\n\"I recognize how upsetting this is for patients and families whose care has been affected, and how difficult and frustrating this is for you all. I am very sorry for the disruption this is causing.\"\n\nAbbs went on to say that an incident response structure has been engaged and NHS Trust officials are meeting regularly to assess the next steps to be taken.\n\nHe confirmed that not all the details are known, nor is it clear how long the issues will persist.\n\nOther leaked documents revealed that the WinPath blood transfusions IT system is down across all sites. As a result, elective surgeries are being halted at specialist heart and lung healthcare center Royal Brompton and Harefield and the only blood components being issued at present are for the most urgent cases.\n\nThe BloodTrack and EPIC systems, a blood transfusion software and a digital health record system respectively, both remain operational, meaning blood components can still be administered where necessary.\n\nThe Register understands that some procedures have been canceled and others redirected to other sites as a result of the incident. All of Synnovis's IT systems are believed to be affected.\n\nSynnovis is a partnership between Synlab, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, delivering pathology and testing services across multiple labs.\n\nMark Dollar, CEO at the Synnovis partnership, said: \"It is still early days and we are trying to understand exactly what has happened. A taskforce of IT experts from Synnovis and the NHS is working to fully assess the impact this has had, and to take the appropriate action needed. We are working closely with NHS Trust partners to minimize the impact on patients and other service users.\n\n\"Regrettably this is affecting patients, with some activity already cancelled or redirected to other providers as urgent work is prioritized. We are incredibly sorry for the inconvenience and upset this is causing to patients, service users and anyone else affected. We are doing our best to minimize the impact and will stay in touch with local NHS services to keep people up to date with developments.\n\n\"We take cybersecurity very seriously at Synnovis and have invested heavily in ensuring our IT arrangements are as safe as they possibly can be. This is a harsh reminder that this sort of attack can happen to anyone at any time and that, dispiritingly, the individuals behind it have no scruples about who their actions might affect.\"\n\nThe incident follows a separate case at Synlab Italia, which in April involved the Black Basta ransomware crew forcing the company's services offline.\n\nPer the official breach information page on Synlab Italia's website, it took the healthcare provider nearly a month to restore the majority of its systems. It appears Synlab Italia didn't pay whatever ransom was demanded of it as Black Basta has its data available to download in full via its blog.\n\nHowever, there is no suggestion that the incident in London today is linked to the attack in Italy.\n\nBlack Basta was also responsible for another recent major ransomware attack that targeted the healthcare sector. The Catholic faith-driven Ascension healthcare group disclosed an attack last month that prompted CISA and Health-ISAC to share guidance on how to thwart the ransomware gang's known tactics and methods. \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blood transfusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Register", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy's_and_St_Thomas'_NHS_Foundation_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Centre_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Cyber Security Centre (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_College_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King's College Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_foundation_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHS foundation trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberwarfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHS England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Greater London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHS trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elective surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ransomware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://regmedia.co.uk/2022/07/22/shutterstock_guyssthomas.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623516", "eventUri": "eng-9623516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The attack disrupts services, leading to canceled operations and impacting blood transfusions. The nature of the attack is suspected to be ransomware, potentially taking weeks to resolve. Urgent and emergency care may be affected due to a lack of access to crucial test results.\n\nLondon's healthcare system is reeling from a cyber attack that has thrown major hospitals into a state of crisis. The attack targeted Synnovis, a vital pathology service provider serving several prominent hospitals in the capital. This has led to a domino effect, impacting everything from blood transfusions to scheduled surgeries.\n\nHospitals Impacted:\n\nKing's College Hospital Guy's and St Thomas' (including Royal Brompton and Evelina London Children's Hospital)\n\nThe Fallout:\n\nCancelled Operations: Hospitals have been forced to cancel or reschedule some procedures due to the lack of access to crucial pathology results. Patients like Oliver Dowson have faced the brunt of this disruption, with his surgery being cancelled twice - once due to the cyber attack and previously due to staff shortages. Blood Transfusion Challenges: Timely and accurate pathology results are essential for safe blood transfusions. The attack has significantly disrupted this process, raising concerns about patient care. Potential Ransomware Attack: While authorities haven't confirmed the exact nature of the attack, sources suggest it could be ransomware, malicious software that encrypts data and demands a ransom for its release. This could take weeks to resolve, further impacting healthcare delivery.\n\nALSO READ: Over 1 Million Users at Risk: Popular Indian Video Calling App Faces Data Breach\n\nConfirmation and Response\n\nA spokesperson for King's College Hospital confirmed that they were affected by the attack. All impacted hospitals have been approached for further comment.\n\nAccording to the Health Service Journal (HSJ), several senior sources indicated that the system had likely fallen victim to a ransomware attack. One source suggested that accessing pathology results could take \"weeks, not days.\" This delay poses a significant risk to urgent and emergency care, which relies on quick-turnaround blood test results.\n\nBackground on Synnovis\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that SynLab would partner with the NHS to deliver pathology services to hospitals and GP services across southeast London. Besides King's College and Guy's and St Thomas', the service also supports South London and Maudsley and Oxleas NHS Foundation Trusts, as well as numerous GP practices, clinics, and community services in Bromley, Lambeth, and Southwark.\n\nPathology services are crucial for diagnosing and treating illnesses and infections by analyzing blood and tissue samples. The disruption caused by this cyberattack highlights the vulnerability of healthcare systems to digital threats and the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect essential medical services.\n\nALSO READ: 361 Million Stolen Email Addresses Added to Have I Been Pwned Database\n\nMoving Forward\n\nHospital administrators are working around the clock to manage the crisis. An incident response team has been established, with representatives from across the Trust meeting regularly to assess the situation and implement contingency plans. All clinical groups are involved in these discussions to ensure comprehensive crisis management. Staff are being urged to direct any clinical or operational questions to their respective clinical group or directorate leadership.\n\nWhile the full extent of the incident and the time required to resolve it remain unclear, updates will be provided through the usual communication channels, including the clinical alert system.\n\nRelated", "source": {"uri": "news.cloudsek.com", "dataType":

Access to services operates normally, including the 999 emergency line and the 111 NHS service.\n\n\"Patients should continue to attend appointments unless they are told otherwise. We will continue to provide updates for local patients and the public about the impact on services and how they can continue to get the care they need,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nServices, including blood transfusions and test results, have been impacted as a result of the cyber attack. In the meantime, some procedures are said to have been cancelled and others redirected to alternative NHS providers.\n\nA 70-year-old patient at the Royal Brompton, Oliver Dowson, said his surgery was cancelled on Monday, when a surgeon told him it would not be going ahead.\n\n\"The staff on the ward didn't seem to know what had happened, just that many patients were being told to go home and wait for a new date. I've been given a date for next Tuesday and am crossing my fingers -- it's not the first time that they have cancelled, they did it on May 28 too, but that was probably staff shortages in half-term week,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the chief executive of Synlab UK and Ireland, Mark Dollar, the company had a \"proven track record\" of successfully working with the NHS.\n\n\"We are passionate about making a difference to patients and clinicians by providing reliable, effective and timely diagnostic information,\" Mr. Dollar said in a statement when the partnership went live.\n\nIn May, cyber criminals published a large volume of data to the dark web. A criminal investigation into the hacking is ongoing and deals with the release of data, including the identities of staff.\n\nAdvanced, which supplies vital systems for the NHS, suffered a cyber breach in August 2022. As a result, a number of systems, including the NHS 111 service and software used to check in patients and maintain medical notes, were taken offline.\n\nAnd a WannaCry ransomware attack hit the NHS in 2017 and affected 80 out of 236 hospital trusts across England. Eight percent of GP practices were also infected by the virus.\n\n\"Cyber-attacks in the UK are increasing with most industry experts thinking it is not a question of 'if' but 'when' the next large scale cyber-attack will occur. All staff must, therefore, remain vigilant and take precautions to reduce this threat,\" said NHS England guidance on data protection.\n\nCommon cyber threats that may target the NHS include phishing, smishing, and spoofing, all of which involve tricking individuals into a compromising course of action or revealing sensitive information.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Blood transfusions and test results have been particularly affected.\n\nThe incident has meant some departments and trusts have been unable to connect to the main server. It is thought that the incident began on Monday.\n\nOne source stated that gaining access to results from pathology could now take \"weeks, not days,\" and that emergency care would be impacted due to the reliance on quick testing and reporting on results.\n\nAs a result of the cyberattack, some procedures have been canceled and others have been redirected to other NHS services. Affected hospitals are still determining what can be done safely under the restrictions caused by the attack.\n\nOne patient, a 70-year-old man, spoke to PA News, stating that he was prepared for a scheduled operation at 6 am Monday, June 3, but was then told at around 12.30 pm that it would not be able to go forward.\n\n\"The staff on the ward didn't seem to know what had happened, just that many patients were being told to go home and wait for a new date.\n\n\"I've been given a date for next Tuesday and am crossing my fingers - it's not the first time that they have canceled, they did it on May 28 too, but that was probably staff shortages in half-term week.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the NHS has been targeted by a ransomware attack. A major incident last year saw a hacker group steal over 70 terabytes of data.", "source": {"uri": "readwrite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ReadWrite"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ali_rees@readwrite.com", "name": "Ali Rees", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelina_London_Children's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evelina London Children's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_College_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King's College Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ransomware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood transfusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://readwrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/download-2024-06-04T141956.398.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623516", "eventUri": "eng-9623516", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1348, "textEnd": 1354}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 1708, "textEnd": 1714}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The incident is also affecting King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust \"and primary care across south east London,\" wrote Abbs, \"having a major impact on the delivery of our services, with blood transfusions being particularly affected.\"\n\nSome appointments have already been canceled or patients have been redirected to other providers at short notice due to the incident.

It is not clear how long the disruption will last for.\n\n\"I recogise how upsetting this is for patients and families whose care has been affected, and how difficult and frustrating this is for you all. I am very sorry for the disruption this is causing,\" Abbs wrote.\n\nThe disruption to the blood transfusion IT system risks having a major impact on trauma cases, as only urgent blood components will be transfused when it is \"critically indicated for the patient,\" according to one message.\n\nRecorded Future News has contacted Synnovis, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, and King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, for comment, but none responded as of publication.\n\nThe attack is the latest of 215 ransomware incidents affecting the health sector in the United Kingdom since January 2019, according to personal data breaches reported to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).\n\nRansomware attacks reached record levels in the United Kingdom last year, according to this data. Although the data suggests that incidents dropped from a record 106 in 2022 to just 32 in 2023, both the ICO and the National Cyber Security Centre have said they are \"increasingly concerned\" about ransomware victims failing to report incidents.\n\nTo tackle the ransomware crisis, officials at the Home Office had planned to launch a public consultation in June proposing radical measures -- including requiring all victims to seek a license before making a ransomware payment -- although these plans have been delayed by the Prime Minister calling a snap election.\n\nAttacks on the healthcare sector risk being especially impactful to patients. Earlier this year, cyber extortionists published sensitive patient data stolen from NHS Dumfries and Galloway, part of the Scottish healthcare system, in a bid to demand money from the local health board.\n\nA ransomware attack affecting Australian health insurance business Medibank back in 2022 saw patient histories and treatment data compromised by criminals.\n\nThe criminals, seeking to extort the Australian business and the affected patients, subsequently began publishing sensitive healthcare claims data for around 480,000 individuals, including information about drug addiction treatments and abortions.", "source": {"uri": "therecord.media", "dataType": "news", "title": "therecord.media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type":

Details of the precise nature of the incident have not been officially disclosed, although according to The Independent, Synnovis has acknowledged that its IT systems were hit by a \"malware attack\".\n\nIn a letter to staff, which has been reviewed by Computer Weekly, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Ian Abbs said Synnovis had experienced a \"major IT incident\" that had caused the Trust to lose connectivity to its network.\n\n\"This is having a major impact on the delivery of our services, with blood transfusions being particularly affected,\" he said. \"Some activity has already been cancelled or redirected to other providers at short notice as we prioritise the clinical work that we are able to safely carry out.\n\n\"I recognise how upsetting this is for patients and families whose care has been affected, and how difficult and frustrating this is for you all. I am very sorry for the disruption this is causing.\"\n\nAccording to Abbs, an incident response structure has now been established to put contingency plans into action, with representation from all clinical groups present. Staffers are being asked to direct any clinical or operational questions to their clinical group or directorate leadership as needed.\n\nAlthough no further detail has been provided of the precise nature of the cyber attack on Synnovis, there is a good chance the organisation will turn out to have been hit by a ransomware gang.\n\nSynnovis's parent, Synlab Europe, experienced significant disruption to its Italian operations in April 2024, which caused similar clinical service delays at Italian hospitals, after a Black Basta ransomware attack.

Their first priority will be to contain the attack if possible ... and quarantine affected networks and systems,\" he told Computer Weekly in emailed comments.\n\n\"Once this is done, they will need to start assessing the damage and restoring impacted services as quickly as possible.

We are doing our best to minimise the impact and will stay in touch with local NHS services to keep people up to date with developments.\n\n\"We take cyber security very seriously at Synnovis and have invested heavily in ensuring our IT arrangements are as safe as they possibly can be. This is a harsh reminder that this sort of attack can happen to anyone at any time and that, dispiritingly, the individuals behind it have no scruples about who their actions might affect.\n\n\"The

to manage cyber attacks, that staff are regularly trained on risk and there is sufficient investment in software resilience.\n\n\"Whoever forms the next Government needs to make sure the NHS has this

The letter also stated that an incident response team is investigating the attack.\n\nResponding to the news of the attack, Trevor Dearing, Director of Critical Infrastructure at Illumio said, \"NHS systems are a prime target for cybercriminals because one tiny breach can impact multiple entities. This is another example of why breach containment is paramount - containing attacks at the point of entry can dramatically reduce the impact of a breach.\"\n\n\"The 'chaos factor', the act of causing mass societal upheaval, is now the driving force behind many cyberattacks, and healthcare is one of the few sectors where cyberattacks can fatally impact human life,\" Dearing continued.\n\n\"The fact the attacker gained access to the network through a third-party IT supplier isn't a surprise. Many healthcare organisations are reliant on these systems to function, and as seen in the Capita IT attack, when these providers are hit, it can have widespread repercussions.\"\n\n\"This is another example of the importance of supply chain security and why hospitals must ensure security controls extend to their third-party software providers. Cybercriminals will always go after the weakest link to gain access to more valuable systems. This is why it's important to implement a Zero Trust approach.

GPs were told to cancel non-emergency pathology appointments and staff were told to only request emergency blood samples for patients requiring transfusions.\n\nA critical incident has since been declared while multiple sources at senior positions within the NHS have confirmed that the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) is now involved.\n\nTransplants have been impacted due to the fact that patients cannot have their blood tests cross-checked, a senior NHS source told The Independent, and healthcare leaders have been told the incident could apparently take \"weeks or months\" to resolve.\n\nThis attack marks the latest in a slew of incidents affecting healthcare providers and once again highlights the vulnerable state of the healthcare industry, experts told ITPro.\n\n\"NHS systems are a prime target for cybercriminals because one tiny breach can impact multiple entities,\" said Trevor Dearing, Director of Critical Infrastructure at Illumio.\n\n\"The 'chaos factor', the act of causing mass societal upheaval, is now the driving force behind many cyberattacks, and healthcare is one of the few sectors where cyberattacks can fatally impact human life,\" he added.\n\nThe attack also demonstrates the \"fragility of critical infrastructure\" in the UK, CPO at Arctic Wolf Dan Schiappa told ITPro, and the hospitals themselves could take a long time to recover.\n\n\"As two of the busiest hospitals in the UK, they hold troves of personal and confidential information on patients, meaning this attack could have long-lasting effects,\" Schiappa said.\n\nSchiappa noted that the incident showcases the wide-ranging disruption threat actors can inflict by targeting third-party suppliers. He added that other users of Synnovis services will need to assess their own security practices in the coming days.\n\nMoving forward, these hospitals will need to prioritize patching \"external facing vulnerabilities\" as well as looking to establish \"comprehensive\" round-the-clock security operations and privileged access management systems.\n\n\"Healthcare providers over the globe should take the suggested steps to ensure patients can safely access care,\" Schiappa said.", "source": {"uri": "itpro.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITProUK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_fitzmaurice@itpro.com", "name": "George Fitzmaurice", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas'_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St Thomas' Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_College_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King's College Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information and communications technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cyber_Security_Centre_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Cyber Security Centre (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_practitioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General practitioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood transfusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumio", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illumio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Critical infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3wh33mBoDhRpHffsA4aBS-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623516", "eventUri": "eng-9623516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust have seen several primary services impacted. As such, this has led to the curtailing of vital procedures, including blood transfusions, and the cancellation or reassignment of several operations.\n\n\"The staff on the ward didn't seem to know what had happened, just that many patients were being told to go home and wait for a new date,\" one patient told PA Media. \"I've been given a date for next Tuesday and am crossing my fingers.\"\n\nThe incident is believed to have begun on Monday when staff at the affected trusts complained of being unable to access relevant servers. The cyberattack itself appears to have targeted Synnovis, a pathology service provider formed out of a collaboration between King's College and Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS trusts. Sources speaking to the Health Service Journal stated that the impacted systems were victims of a ransomware attack. Meanwhile, staff told Sky News that doctors overseeing emergency blood transfusions were being forced to record their notes exclusively on pen and paper.\n\nIf ransomware is involved, it would be the second major NHS cyberattack of this year. In March, hackers from the INC Ransom collective threatened to release patient data it had stolen from NHS Dumfries and Galloway. The trust later confirmed that the data being offered for sale by the group was genuine. \"NHS Dumfries and Galloway is very acutely aware of the potential impact of this development on the patents whose data has been published, and the general anxiety which might result within our patient population,\" said its health board chief executive, Jeff Ace.\n\nHealthcare institutions remain juicy targets for ransomware gangs, said Martin Lee, Cisco's technical lead of security research, with hackers believing the consequences of their actions likely to accelerate quick returns for their efforts. \"Outages apply pressure on management to pay off the attackers to restore availability quickly,\" argued Lee. \"However, paying the ransom means that these attacks remain profitable and ultimately only serve to encourage further attacks.\"\n\nWarding off future attacks requires a strategy of reliance on the part of healthcare providers, added Lee. That, he elaborated, requires \"blocking as many attacks as possible, quickly identifying when attackers have gained access to systems - and responding swiftly to eject attackers and restore functions if attacks do succeed.\"", "source": {"uri": "techmonitor.ai", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blood transfusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PA Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy's_and_St_Thomas'_NHS_Foundation_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hospital trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_College_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "King's College Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ransomware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Dumfries_and_Galloway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHS Dumfries and Galloway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Service_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health Service Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHS trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas'_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Thomas' Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "King's College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ransom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://techmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/06/shutterstock_1434570395.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623516", "eventUri": "eng-9623516", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

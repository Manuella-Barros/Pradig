This law will address infrastructure, teacher qualifications, fees, and misleading advertisements.\"\n\nIn a joint press conference with Delhi Mayor Shelly Oberoi, Atishi said, \"A committee will be formed today to formulate the Coaching Institute Regulations Act. It will include Delhi government officials and students preparing for different papers.\"\n\nShe also provided an email address http://coaching.law .feedback@gmail.com to collect feedback from students and the public on this law. Everyone can give their feedback on this, Atishi said.\n\n\"I received an internal investigation report on July 29. It revealed that the drain that was responsible for the waterlogging in that area was encroached upon by several coaching institutes there. The other reason was that coaching institutes were running classes and libraries in the basement. This was absolutely wrong,\" Atishi said.\n\nThe basement can only be used for parking and stores. After this report, MCD fired the Junior Engineer (JE) from the job. Along with this, the Assistant Engineer (AE) has been suspended, Atishi added.\n\nAfter the tragic incident in Rajendra Nagar, I directed the MCD Commissioner to take action against the illegal coaching centres and the officials responsible for this incident. Along with this, many coaching centres which were running classes and libraries in the basement have been given notice and their basements will be sealed from today, Atishi asserted.\n\nIn the last three days, basements of 30 coaching centres in Rajendra Nagar, Mukherjee Nagar, Preet Vihar and Laxmi Nagar have been sealed. Apart from this, notices have been issued to 200 other coaching centres. The work of sealing the basement will continue today as well, Atishi informed.\n\nUNI PSP CS1546", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "http://www.uniindia.com/fadnavis-orders-probe-into-mumbai-pub-fire/states/news/1090400.html"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atishi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atishi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajinder_Nagar_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajinder Nagar Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly_Oberoi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shelly Oberoi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukherjee_Nagar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mukherjee Nagar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preet_Vihar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preet Vihar"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Nagar,_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajendra Nagar, Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxmi_Nagar_(Delhi)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laxmi Nagar (Delhi)"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.uniindia.com/cms/gall_content/2024/7/2024_7$largeimg31_Jul_2024_161317067.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775565", "eventUri": "eng-9775565", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 18}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 1090, "textEnd": 1097}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The other thing is, the way coaching centres were running classes in the basement and libraries were set up, was 100% illegal...the Junior Engineer who was responsible for the drain there and to ensure there was no encroachment happening, that Junior Engineer was permanently terminated from MCD,\" the Delhi Minister said.\n\n\"The Assistant Engineer was suspended...magisterial report will come in 6 days and those who will be found responsible, strict action will be taken against them...the coaching centres which had encroached upon drains, those illegal encroachments have been bulldozed...the coaching centres that are running classes in the basement and set up libraries, strict action is being taken against them since last 3 days,\" she added.\n\nThree IAS aspirants, Shreya Yadav from Uttar Pradesh, Tanya Soni from Telangana, and Nevin Dalwin from Kerala died on Saturday night after the basement of Rau's IAS Study Circle was inundated with floodwater amid heavy rains.\n\nOn Monday, the Delhi minister had flagged the delay in submission of magisterial inquiry report in connection with the incident in a note to Cheif Secretary Naresh Kumar.

The tragedy brought to light the use of unauthorised basements at the coaching centres in Delhi, and Rau's IAS -- where the mishap happened -- is not the only coaching centre flouting norms, according to the students.\n\n\"Most of the coaching centres, if not all, are conducting classes in the basement,\" a UPSC aspirant told the Free Press Journal requesting anonymity. \"There should be a thorough investigation and every institution that is violating the norms and putting the students' lives in danger should face stringent action,\" the aspirant added.\n\n\"In recent years, to lure more students, the coaching institutes have tied up with libraries and they offer free one-year subscriptions to these libraries with new admissions. 90-95% of these libraries function out of the basements in Rajinder Nagar, Mukherjee Nagar, Karol Bagh and Patel Nagar,\" Avesh Khan, another UPSC aspirant told FPJ. These areas in the national capital have the maximum number of coaching institutes.\n\nKhan added: \"After the tragedy, the authorities (Municipal Corporation of Delhi) have sealed a few libraries which operate from the basements, while a few other owners have shut their libraries, even removed their hoardings and boards, and have absconded.\"\n\nSpeaking to the FPJ, Prateek Abhimanyu, a family friend of Tania Soni from Telangana who lost her life, said \"everyone who is in a position of power is responsible\" for the tragic accident. \"Only after the tragedy has happened, we are getting to know about institutions flouting norms,\" he said, asking: \"Why was the MCD not taking any action against such coaching institutions? What was the MCD Mayor doing? What were the Delhi Chief Minister, the MLA and the MP of the area doing? What was the Lieutenant Governor, who speaks on every subject and even takes actions, doing?\"\n\nAt Rau's IAS, the owner of the building had shown that the basement would be used as a store room to acquire the fire department's no objection certificate (NOC), but the owner violated the norms and the basement was being used as a library/classroom, according to the FIR. This phenomenon, however, is \"not limited to one or two coaching centres\".\n\nIn fact, nearly a month before the tragic accident at Rau's IAS, civil services aspirant Kishor Singh Kushwah had filed a complaint against the coaching centres with the MCD on June 26 and had warned of a \"possibility of a major accident\", according to media reports.\n\n\"Despite not having permission, they are running a classroom without NOC in the basement; they are running test classes, which are affecting the lives of students and staff. There is a possibility of a major accident. Big UPSC coaching institutes are running classes at illegal places, putting the lives of the students at risk,\" Kushwah had written in his complaint.\n\nThe students are still demanding action against such coaching institutes that have been flouting norms. Protests have been ongoing ever since the news of the tragic incident broke out and one of the several demands by the protesting students reads: \"There should be strict actions against all the coaching institutes, buildings and properties that do not follow proper construction and security measures. All the libraries in the basement defying the appropriate safety and security protocols should be closed forever.\"\n\nAdditionally, the waterlogging in Rajinder Nagar and Mukherjee Nagar, the two areas in the National Capital where most of the coaching centres are located, is a norm every year with little being done by the authorities to improve drainage systems in these localities.\n\n\"There should be proper cleaning of the drainage system and MCD should be held responsible for their inaction,\" says another demand by the protesting students.\n\nFurthermore, students complained that these buildings do not have a fire or emergency exit and that it is \"a systematic problem\" in these coaching centres and there is \"a lack of interest in safety measures\" on the part of the coaching centres. Students have been demanding the closure of such spaces where \"students' lives can be in danger.\" \"First there should be a proper investigation and only those buildings which have emergency exits should be allowed to function so that such tragedies don't happen again,\" said a student on the condition of anonymity.\n\nIn the past, there have been multiple complaints of libraries/classes operating from the basements, waterlogging every year in locations that host most of these coaching centres and poor drainage systems in these localities, but no action has been taken on any of these aspects. Had the concerned authorities taken these complaints seriously, the major tragedy may have been averted and three innocent lives could have been saved.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in",

launched by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) on coaching centres operating in basements or using the space as a library, several privately-owned licensed libraries in the Old Rajinder Nagar area, and its adjoining areas where coaching institutes are located, have allegedly doubled their membership fees, adding to the woes of UPSC aspirants who already a pay hefty amounts for coaching classes.\n\nMany civil service aspirants have claimed that the fee hike by private libraries is a direct result of MCD action against coaching centres whose basements have been sealed by the civic body, following death of three civil services aspirants in Old Rajinder Nagar last Saturday after a coaching centre basement, which was illegally being used as a library, got flooded due to heavy rain.\n\n\"Earlier, the library owners, who ran libraries on the first or second floor, used to charge Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 per month but now after the closure of many libraries, they have doubled their fees knowing the students have no other option,\" Pankaj, a UPSC aspirant, told news agency PTI.\n\nPankaj noted that most civil service aspirants live in rented rooms during the course of their UPSC coaching and need libraries to study and prepare as their accommodations are too small and cramped to do that.\n\n\"The students who will be appearing for the (UPSC) mains exams shortly have nowhere else to go because the rooms in which we live are so small that we cannot study and we need libraries,\" Pankaj said.\n\nAnother student, also preparing for this year's UPSC mains, said the libraries in the adjoining areas of Rajinder Nagar, such as Patel Nagar, have also hiked their fees, asking students to pay Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 per month, more than double the amount they charged previously.\n\nOn Sunday, the MCD had launched a drive against coaching centres in the Old Rajinder Nagar area, a coaching hub in central Delhi, sealing 13 illegal coaching centres who found to be running classes in their basements or using the space as a library.\n\nThe action came a day after three UPSC aspirants died in a flooded basement at the Rau's IAS Study Circle, a prominent coaching centre in the central Delhi coaching hub.\n\nOn Monday, the MCD terminated an officer and suspended another as well as launched an anti-encroachment drive to remove illegal structures covering storm drains which leads to waterlogging in the Old Rajinder Nagar area, the civic body said.\n\nThe MCD also launched a similar crackdown in northwest Delhi's coaching hub Mukherjee Nagar on Monday and sealed Drishti IAS- a prominent IAS coaching institute, after the establishment was found using the building basement as a classroom.", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Select officers coming in to teach aspirants adds another layer of complexity. Deeper issues must be identified and fixed for any meaningful change,\" he added.\n\nManagement of a reputed coaching centre in Old Rajinder Nagar, too, welcomed the step.\n\n\"A grievance redressal cell should be there so that all students can raise their concerns.

The hubs are wholly inadequate and insufficient to support safe learning needs of aspirants. Government should work to establish new coaching infrastructure with requisite and ample facilities. Jaipur's Pratap Nagar model needs to be emulated in Delhi,\" said Furqan Hashmi, associate director, StudyIQ.\n\nDuring the press conference Wednesday, Atishi also said that the Delhi government was hoping the Centre would come up with a law to regulate coaching centres after the tragedy, but it didn't. \"This act will have infrastructural norms, teachers' qualifications will be specified, fees will be regulated, and coaching centres will be stopped from disseminating misleading information... There will be regular inspections,\" she added.\n\nShe stressed that the proposed law will be drafted after taking feedback from students and coaching centres.\n\nAtishi also said that no officer responsible for the deaths of three UPSC students will be spared.

The permission given to the coaching centre by the building department was to use the basement only as a storage or parking space. The rest of the inquiry report will come in seven days,\" she said.\n\nShe added, \"MCD had started the inquiry based on the preliminary inquiry report. The Junior engineer who was responsible for the drain there and ensuring there was no encroachment has been permanently terminated. The Assistant Engineer, whose responsibility was to check if the drains were functioning, has also been suspended. It was his responsibility to check if the rules and regulations were being followed. He has been suspended. The investigation will be carried out on both the officers.\"\n\nFurther, she said that after the magisterial report would come, strict action would be taken.\n\n\"The Magisterial report will come in 6 days and for those who are found responsible, action would be taken against them. As soon as we received the information that the drain encroachment was taking place and waterlogging was caused, Mayor Shailey Oberoi sent instructions to bulldoze all coaching centres that were encroached on the drains,\" she said.\n\nAtishi also added that 30 coaching centres in areas like Rajendra Nagar, Preet Vihar, Laxmi Nagar, and Mukherjee Nagar have been sealed for setting up libraries in the basements. Drishti IAS Centre and Sanskruti Academy are among these 30 centres. Meanwhile, 200 other institutes were also sent a notice.\n\n\"Coaching centres in areas like Rajendra Nagar, Preet Vihar, Mukherjee Nagar, and Preet Vihar have been seized for setting up libraries in the basements, which include the Drishti IAS Centre and Sanksruti Academy, among the 30 institutes. 200 other institutes have been sent a notice,\" Atishi said.\n\nMeanwhile, Delhi Mayor Shelly Oberoi stated on Wednesday that all demands of the students will be heard and a meeting will soon be held with them.\n\nConveying her condolences to the families of the deceased, she said, \"In the incident that happened in the coaching centre's basement, we found that there was only one entry and exit route. We convey our condolences to the families of these students. We will listen to the demands of the students, hold a meeting with them soon, and after that, pass that regulation in the Delhi Assembly.\"\n\nFurther, she added that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi will have to abide by all the new rules and regulations that will be passed and strict actions will be taken against all those who will be found guilty.\n\n\"MCD will also have to follow all the rules and regulations. I want to inform the public that we will be conducting our basement drive and strict action will be taken against all those who are guilty. No irresponsibility will be tolerated in the coming future,\" she said.

While there is no discounting the culpability of municipal and local authorities - who have constantly failed to ensure coaching centres adhere to rules and regulations - the deaths should pave the way for structural reform in India's education sector. After all, how does the drowning of civil service aspirants in drain water and deluge reflect on the nation as a whole? Rest assured, it does not paint a rosy picture for either our present or the future.\n\nIndia's coaching industry is an emerging behemoth. There are over 68,000 coaching institutes in India - all overselling the dream of a successful career to millions of students. The revenue of the Indian coaching industry is estimated to reach Rs 1.34 lakh crore by 2028. Interestingly, the GST collected from such institutes over the past five years has more than doubled to Rs 5,517 crore.\n\nThis indicates not just a burgeoning demand for such coaching institutes, but also a rise in the number of students opting for coaching due to one, the failures of India's formal education system and two, the overboard marketing undertaken by coaching institutes to enrol more students, and consequently, mint more money. The UPSC coaching industry alone is valued at over Rs 3,000 crore. For all the revenue it generates, students are provided sub-human living conditions, apathetic infrastructure and unimaginable mental and psychological stress. A visit to Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar can reveal as much.\n\nHere are some numbers which show how India's coaching industry is nothing but a profit-making machine, which has revenue as its primary driving force, and not the urge to help students realise their dreams. Indian students are being duped and betrayed on a daily basis, while their dreams are reduced to a weakness coaching centres make a fortune out of.\n\nIn Kota, the coaching capital of India for engineering and medical entrance exams, at least 26 aspirants committed suicide in 2023 - the highest since 2015. In fact, close to 130 students have taken their own lives since 2015 in Kota alone. None of these tragedies have brought about a change in India's coaching culture. The fact is, matters are only going from bad to worse.\n\nDue to the inability of our education system to prepare students for competitive exams or equipping them with skills needed in the job market, the country is now seeing a mushrooming of the coaching industry. Coaching centres are not supposed to be institutes which students have to mandatorily enrol in if they want to crack tough examinations. Unfortunately, that is exactly what they have become. We now have a situation where students who choose not to enrol in such coaching centres, or simply cannot afford them are at a distinct disadvantage to those who slog it out in Kota or Delhi's Mukherjee and Rajinder Nagars.\n\nOver the past few years, Indians across cities and towns have seen a new addition to the urban landscape - big, colourful flex banners and posters marketing a host of coaching institutes to aspirational families. Coaching institutes sell what matters most to Indians: a lucrative career with guaranteed success. The success is obviously not guaranteed, but coaching centres promise it just the same.\n\nIf UPSC, JEE, NEET and CAT coaching institutes were not enough, we now also have centres promising students a glittering performance in the Common University Entrance Test (CUET). That's still not all. Coaching institutes are also doubling down as centres which lure Indian youth with the promise of jobs. Given how the youth is struggling to find employment, coaching centres that promise to equip them with skills needed in the job market are flourishing too.\n\nApart from forcing students to live in unhygienic, unsafe, crammed up ghettos and study in rooms with no ventilation, coaching centres are culpable of other travesties too. The revenue generated by coaching institutes comes out of the pockets of modest Indian families who want to see their children succeed in life. These are children that almost always hail from the lower-middle or middle-income class.\n\nInstead of using the money they make to improve students' learning and living experience, coaching centres spend most of it on marketing and advertising themselves, apart from paying handsome salaries to faculty - many of whom are former bureaucrats, as well as doctors and engineers themselves. That the owners of such institutes make a fortune out of the misery of desperate students is a known fact. Coaching institutes are guilty of overselling the idea of competitive examinations to the youth, to the extent that many now believe that enrolment in a \"good\" institute is all that is needed to make the cut.\n\nIt is not as if the founders and bosses of such coaching centres do not know what they are up to. Everyone in the business knows how there is a major demand-supply deficit in the number of students sitting for competitive examinations and the number of them succeeding. In 2022, over 11 lakh aspirants sat for the UPSC exam. How many seats were they competing for? A meagre 1,022. Similarly, more than 14 million students sat for JEE this year. They were all competing with each other for roughly 59,917 seats. Speaking of NEET, 2.3 million candidates competed with each other for just about one lakh seats.\n\nThe commercialisation of education in India is complete, and most of it has been driven by the coaching industry's incessant want for profits and stardom. However, the coaching industry, for all its faults is, after all, a business. A major share of the blame must also be directed towards India's redundant education system, which is constantly failing students. The failure of our education system has created a situation where a shadow system now flourishes - in which aspirants enrol into dummy schools in order to complete their higher education, all while attending classes at coaching centres where the focus is rigidly academic.\n\nThe time to regulate the coaching industry is now. Earlier this year, the central government came out with guidelines on how coaching centres must operate. As is evident from the recent tragedy, such guidelines exist only on paper.

New legislation aims to enhance safety and oversight.\n\nDelhi Minister Atishi announced on Wednesday that the state government will introduce new legislation to regulate coaching centres. This decision follows a recent tragedy in Old Rajender Nagar, where severe waterlogging led to the deaths of three UPSC aspirants.\n\nAtishi revealed that the waterlogging in the area was exacerbated by encroachments from coaching centres, which obstructed the drainage system. Many coaching centres were found to be illegally operating in basements and running libraries, further contributing to the flooding issues. The Junior Engineer responsible for overseeing the drainage system has been permanently terminated from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), while the Assistant Engineer has been suspended. A magisterial report on the incident is expected within six days, and strict action will be taken against those found responsible.

The incident occurred at Rau's Study Circle in Old Rajinder Nagar on Saturday evening after heavy rains.\n\nThe AAP MP said in the letter that in the past few years, cases of paper leak have increased.\n\nThe collusion between the coaching institutes and corrupt elements in the government machinery have jeopardised the future of lakhs of students, he alleged.\n\nIn the letter to PM, Sanjay Singh also said, \"I would like to inform you that the incidents of paper leaks have been continuously increasing in the country for the last few years. The collusion between the government machivery and the coaching mafia has put the future of millions of youth in the country in jeopardy.\"\n\nThe AAP MP in the letter further said that the coaching mafia has been found to have a big role in the paper leaks happening in the country. \"Be it NEET paper, government recruitment exam or university admission exam. Be it Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh or Bihar, coaching mafias have been involved in paper leaks in all the exams,\" Singh said.\n\nStepping up his attacks on the coaching institutes, Singh said that the coaching institutes in the country have become money-printing machines. He added, \"Lakhs of rupees are being demanded from parents in the name of admission in medical and IIT. Some are paying the coaching fees by investing their entire life's savings and some are selling their land and property and hence, it is necessary to make government rules. Despite charging exorbitant fees, coaching operators try to earn maximum income with minimum expenditure, hence they force more students to sit in dilapidated buildings than their capacity.\"\n\nThe letter by AAP MP criticised the infrastructure of the coaching institutes and said, \"These coaching institutes neither have proper exit gates nor entry gates; neither the security related aspects are taken into account nor is anyone concerned about it while taking space on rent from the building owners.\"\n\n\"The students who come to the institutions to shape their future are constantly in danger of accidents and the same is the condition of the accommodation facilities of the students for which huge rents are charged. Only food is supplied in the name of facilities,\" the letter said.\n\nUrging the Prime Minister to bring a law to prevent the wrongdoings of the coaching centres, Singh said, \" The operators of coaching institutes are putting the lives of the students at risk. They are violating the rules and carrying out paper leaks indiscriminately. They are trying to cheat parents by charging huge fees. The attitude of all the governments in this matter has been disappointing. An appropriate central law should be made to prevent this.\"\n\nThe letter further said, \"Therefore, keeping in mind the future of the students, it is a humble request to you that appropriate law should be made immediately to crack down on the coaching mafias so that the tragic incident that happened in Old Rajendra Nagar is not repeated.\" (ANI)", "source": {"uri": "aninews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asian News International (ANI)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1fia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Nagar,_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rajendra Nagar, Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Institutes of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://d3lzcn6mbbadaf.cloudfront.net/media/details/ANI-20240730105846.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775565", "eventUri": "eng-9775565", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 19, "textEnd": 26}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Ironically, it was just six months ago that the Union Ministry of Education had issued a set of guidelines for the regulation of coaching centres. The guidelines encompass key aspects, including infrastructure prerequisites, such as fire safety codes, building safety codes and other standards. It is clear that these norms are observed more in the breach than in the practice. The tragedy at Rau's IAS Study Circle in Delhi's Old Rajinder Nagar was waiting to happen as it has now emerged that the owner of the centre did not follow the zoning regulations or safety norms. The absence of a proper drainage system in the basement was a critical factor leading to the death of students. What was even more appalling was that a student had flagged the issue last month that the coaching centre's basement was not safe but the warning was ignored. It has emerged that the local fire department has failed to adhere to safety standards. Several glaring lapses by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) have also come to light. The coaching institute was given a no objection certificate (NOC) by the MCD despite having no clearance to run classes in the basement of the building. There were also concerns over the delay on the part of the Delhi police in making the arrests.\n\nAfter every such mishap in India, a political blame game breaks while the main issues concerning safety are relegated to the background. Though the MCD has terminated the services of a junior engineer and suspended an assistant engineer, besides carrying out an anti-encroachment drive and sealing the premises of several illegal coaching centres in the area, the measures amount to knee-jerk reactions. Given the massive business potential, coaching factories have mushroomed across the country, flouting norms. As per 2022 estimates, the coaching industry in India is a huge money-spinner -- it is worth Rs 58,000 crore and projected to reach Rs 1.3 lakh crore by 2028. It is not uncommon for operators to make compromises to cut down costs. In the Rajya Sabha, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar said coaching centres had become no less than gas chambers. The AAP government has accused the Centre-nominated Lieutenant Governor of Delhi of turning a blind eye to the city's mess while the BJP has placed the blame at the doorsteps of the State government.

After the incident in Rajinder Nagar, my coaching classes are shut completely. There is uncertainty about what will happen and when our classes will resume as my Mains exams are approaching,\" Amit, a UPSC aspirant, told PTI.\n\n\"Most of the institutes are completely closed here. They are neither taking offline or online classes as of now. We have no clarity when will our classes resume,\" another civil services aspirant, Aarti, said.\n\nMukherjee Nagar, a hub of UPSC coaching centres in northwest Delhi, came under MCD's scanner on Monday in the aftermath of the Rajinder Nagar coaching centre basement flooding that claimed three lives on Saturday. The agency continued its sealing drive to shut institutes running illegally from basement in other areas of the city.\n\nAccording to MCD building bye-laws, basement of a building can only be used for parking or storage purpose. Using it for commercial purpose is prohibited.\n\nThis uncertainty has forced many outstation students to plan to return home to save on rent while the classes are suspended. Some students also demanded online classes to avoid any loss in studies.\n\n\"I am from Deoghar in Jharkhand. Since the incident, no classes have been held and no information is being provided regarding the classes. I am planning to go home as I don't think classes will be resumed in offline mode anytime soon. If they take classes in online mode then I can do that from my home, why will I pay rent here?\" Kuldeep, a UPSC aspirant residing in Rajinder Nagar, said.\n\nAnother student from Rajasthan said he paid a huge amount of fees for the coaching classes. \"I came here to fulfil my dream of becoming an IAS officer. My parents somehow arranged the fees. Since the classes are suspended now, I don't know what to do. Institutes should at least start online classes so that we can study,\" the student said.\n\nPTI approached several coaching centres in Mukherjee Nagar and Rajendra Nagar to seek information on when the classes would resume and if alternative arrangements were being made to take classes in the online mode.\n\nA representative of a prominent coaching institute, Drishti IAS, whose basement has been sealed by the MCD in Mukherjee Nagar, said its new batch will be delayed beyond the scheduled date of August 9.\n\n\"At present, all the institutes here have stopped their classes because of the sealing. We cannot confirm right now when we will be able to resume classes. Our new batch starting August 9 will also be delayed, maybe by 4-5 days. As soon as the situation improves, we will restart our operations,\" the representative said.\n\n\"We also cannot say if online classes will be provided unless things settle down,\" he added.\n\nA representative of Sanskriti IAS in Mukherjee Nagar said the classes are likely to resume from Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the MCD has expanded its sealing drive to several other areas of the city that house coaching centres. On Tuesday, the civic body launched a drive in east Delhi's Preet Vihar after sealing 20 basements in Mukherjee Nagar and Rajinder Nagar since Sunday for being misused for commercial purposes.\n\nThe drive is ongoing and will continue in additional areas.\n\nThree civil services aspirants died Saturday evening after water from a flooded drain gushed into the basement of Rau's IAS Study Circle where a library was set up.\n\nThe deceased were identified as Uttar Pradesh's Shreya Yadav, Telangana's Tanya Soni and Kerala's Navin Dalwin.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajinder_Nagar_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajinder Nagar Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukherjee_Nagar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mukherjee Nagar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoghar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deoghar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deoghar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preet_Vihar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preet Vihar"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajendra_Nagar,_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajendra Nagar, Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Jujutsu", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Jujutsu", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Yoga", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Yoga", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Reiki", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Reiki", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Krav_Maga", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Krav Maga", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/upsc-coaching-orn-2024-07-784978eca0163682406f2b755f12ea22-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775565", "eventUri": "eng-9775565", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 3015, "textEnd": 3023, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Such rooms accommodate around five to six students,\" he said.\n\nThe common refrain among the aspirants is, \"Abhi jhel lo, ek bar naukri lag gai, to aage piche naukar-chaakar honge hi (Suffer now, we'll have servants soon).\"\n\nSeveral civil services aspirants living in the two city coaching hubs say they stay in windowless basements, which get inundated every time it rains heavily.

Hardly anyone complains about such facts,\" a student said.\n\nNot only PGs, but even classes are overcrowded with no proper facilities.\n\nAccording to several accounts, if a classroom has a strength of 100 students, the owners try to accommodate more than 120 to 125 students.\n\n\"Those who are unable to sit or take class receive recorded video material to sit in the basement and to study there in the library,\" a 25-year-old civil aspirant said.\n\nRenting out basements as PGs is unlawful as the Master Plan for Delhi (MPD) 2021 permits such spaces to be used only as storage, parking, and utility areas.\n\n\"Suddenly, the government is being strict but this is just a phase as an incident has happened.

However, no follow-up measures were undertaken either by the institutes concerned or the fire department , they said.\n\nKhushboo Yadav, one of the managers at a NEET coaching centre in Sector 14, said that the staff has no idea about any NOC and they had not applied yet. \"No incident has ever taken place in our building. No one has ever complained, we have been operating for the last 10 years and we have never faced any challenges. We have over 900 students visiting every day in different batches but they have been safe and so is the staff,\" she said.\n\nOne coaching centre, which has six batches running a day, had students studying in a basement room with a single narrow staircase. The staircase can only accommodate one student either to enter or exit. The management of this institute said that they were not aware that they had to take a NOC for running a centre.\n\nNaina Sharma, another manager of a coaching academy in Sector 14, said that she remembers some officials visiting their centre in May 2019 but after that no one ever visited them or asked for any NOC. \"Due to acute space crunch, the staircase is narrow. We have utilized maximum space for the classrooms. We set up the centre in 2014, but we do not have an NOC or fire extinguishers so far. We will apply if it is required but someone should approach us,\" she said.\n\nThis alarming discovery raises serious concerns about the safety standards of coaching centres in Gurugram. Despite the clear risks, the fire department officials said that they did not have any data on the number of coaching centres operational in the city. This lack of oversight highlights a critical gap in the enforcement of fire safety regulations in Gurugram.\n\nGulshan Kalra, deputy director (technical), Haryana Fire Services, who also holds the charge of deputy director (technical) of the fire station at Sector 29, said that not a single coaching institute, whether functioning from residential or industrial areas, has a valid NOC from the fire department. \"This blatant disregard for fire safety norms puts the lives of thousands of students and staff at risk. The absence of fire safety measures, such as functional fire extinguishers and clear evacuation routes, aggravates the danger. We have formed teams that have started visiting the coaching institutes and will check for violations. Based on the visit, notices will be sent to the owners of institutes and we will seal them if they continue to operate without NOCs,\" he said.\n\nThe recent findings by HT have highlighted the urgent need for stringent fire safety audits and enforcement of regulations in educational institutions. Parents and students are now calling for immediate action to ensure that all coaching centres comply with fire safety norms to prevent any potential disasters.\n\nRahul Thakran, a student preparing for NEET expressed his concern, \"We come here to study and secure our future, but with no fire safety measures in place, we are risking our lives every day. The authorities must take immediate action and ensure the coaching centres are properly built and have proper fire exit doors. After incidents of fire and drowning in coaching centres, our families are worried but we are helpless since we have already paid for the entire year,\" he said.\n\nSeema Gupta, mother of a 17-year-old taking classes of JEE Mains said, \"I am terrified every time my child goes to these coaching centres. The administration and the police need to ensure that these places are safe for our children. Sector 14 is the only educational hub for coaching and the condition of the buildings is pathetic, there is no maintenance at all. We are helpless since we cannot send the child to Delhi, so this is the best we have,\" she said.\n\nThe administration's lack of data and oversight is a major concern, and it is imperative that immediate steps are taken to rectify the situation. The fire department must conduct a comprehensive survey to identify all coaching centres in the city and ensure they meet the required safety standards, demanded parents.\n\nThe Gurugram administration has ordered safety audits of all coaching centres in the district and a team was formed on Monday to compile data and visit the sites to check the safety measures in place.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said the safety and well-being of the students is most important. \"Every coaching centre must comply with safety norms to avoid such tragic incidents. The teams are compiling a list of coaching institutes that are operating from basements in the city and we will take strict action against anyone operating illegally,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fire safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fire department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hindustan Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Eligibility_cum_Entrance_Test_(Undergraduate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_extinguisher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fire extinguisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurgaon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gurgaon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gurgaon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fire station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deputy commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(emblem)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seal (emblem)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drowning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/30/1600x900/The-Gurugram-administration-has-ordered-safety-aud_1722364766563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775565", "eventUri": "eng-9775565", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-", "textStart": 1349, "textEnd": 1357}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Shreya Yadav from Uttar Pradesh, Tanya Soni from Telangana, and Navin Dalwin from Kerala passed away after the basement of the building housing the coaching center was flooded following heavy rain. Consequently, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) sealed the basements of 13 coaching centers in Old Rajinder Nagar for violating norms, underscoring the urgent need for stringent supervision of India's burgeoning coaching industry.\n\nIn today's highly competitive market, coaching centers are ubiquitous. A report by Google and KPMG estimates the coaching industry in India to be worth around \u20b958,000 crore, with civil services exam coaching contributing \u20b93,000 crore. Each year, lakhs of students compete for UPSC exams, but only a few thousand hit the bull's eye. Unfortunately, the success rate is not above 0.02 to 0.04 percent, suggest various estimates. Intense competition for a secured, prestigious government position or a high-paying white-collar job drives students towards various coaching hubs of the country. Many seek help from coaching centers, which promise to guide them towards their goals.\n\nBeneath the glass facades of these coaching centers and their misleading promises, several critical issues go unnoticed. The infrastructure of the training centers, the quality of training, student-to-teacher ratio, and building safety are only a few to name. Therefore, regulation is needed to ensure that coaching centers adhere to fair practices and provide quality education with a strong focus on student safety.\n\nEarlier this year, the Ministry of Education released specific instructions for the functioning of coaching centers across India. The Department of Higher Education issued the \"Guidelines for Regulation of Coaching Centers 2024,\" aimed at establishing standards for regulating coaching centers to enhance student supervision and support for study programs, competitive exams, and academics.\n\nOne of the guidelines focuses on \"Basic Infrastructure and Limited Study Hours.\" It mandates that coaching centers allocate a minimum of one square meter per student in each class. The guidelines also require compliance with fire safety and building codes, including obtaining Fire and Building Safety Certificates. Additionally, the guidelines state that adequate electrification, ventilation, lighting, and security measures must be followed. Coaching centers are also directed to be equipped with CCTV cameras, a first aid kit, and access to medical assistance. \"You can click here to read details regarding the same,\" the guidelines articulate.\n\nWhile policy-level initiatives and improved supervision are required from the government, students and parents also need to be mindful while choosing a coaching center. Here are five factors to keep in mind.\n\nSafety and Compliance: Safety should be a top priority. Ensure the coaching center adheres to all safety regulations and standards. Verify that the facility has proper emergency exits, fire safety measures, and compliance with building codes to mitigate potential hazards. Emergency exits should be clearly marked and easily visible. The facility should be equipped with fire extinguishers and smoke detectors. Additionally, check if the building adheres to structural codes to ensure its safety. Regular sanitation should also be practiced to prevent the spread of illness.\n\nLocation and Accessibility: The location and accessibility of the coaching center are crucial. Choose one that is conveniently located, preferably close to home or easily accessible by public transportation. This will reduce commute time and help you manage your classes and studies better. For those who drive, ensure there is adequate parking space. Additionally, consider the proximity of emergency services. Students coming from different parts of the country should check if the center is close to their hostels or PG accommodations.\n\nFacilities and Infrastructure: Evaluate the quality of facilities and infrastructure at the coaching center. Ensure classrooms are clean, well-lit, and well-ventilated. Adequate lighting and ventilation are essential for a comfortable learning environment. Check that restrooms and break areas are clean and comfortable.\n\nQuality of Training: Do your groundwork well before finalizing a coaching institute. Research the coaching center's reputation by reading reviews from current and past students. Talk to students to get detailed feedback on the quality of teaching, success rates, and overall safety. Look for reviews on the center's infrastructure. Check if it is accredited by relevant educational institutions or has partnerships with reputable organizations.\n\nStudent-Teacher Ratio: Assess the student-to-teacher ratio to ensure you receive sufficient attention and support. A lower ratio typically means more one-on-one time with instructors, leading to a more focused and engaging learning experience. Additionally, check if the center offers extra support services, such as counseling and mentoring.\n\n(The article was originally published in TOI)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com",

The new batch of UPSC aspirants, scheduled to commence in the first week of August, is likely to face delays as most coaching institutes in the areas have ceased operations, apprehensive of a crackdown by the MCD. This situation has left students worried about their preparation for the upcoming exams.\n\n\"I am a student of Vision IAS. After the incident in Rajinder Nagar, my coaching classes are shut completely. There is uncertainty about what will happen and when our classes will resume as my Mains exams are approaching,\" Amit, a UPSC aspirant, told PTI.\n\n\"Most of the institutes are completely closed here. They are neither taking offline or online classes as of now. We have no clarity when will our classes resume,\" another civil services aspirant, Aarti, said.\n\nMukherjee Nagar, known as a hub for UPSC coaching centres in northwest Delhi, recently came under the MCD's scrutiny following a tragic incident at a coaching centre in Rajinder Nagar. The MCD's continued sealing drive aims to close down institutes operating illegally from basements across the city.\n\nAs per MCD building bye-laws, basements should only be utilized for parking or storage purposes, prohibiting their commercial use. The prevailing uncertainty has prompted many outstation students to consider returning home to cut down on rent expenses during the suspension period. Additionally, some students have advocated for online classes to mitigate any disruptions in their studies.\n\n\"I am from Deoghar in Jharkhand. Since the incident, no classes have been held and no information is being provided regarding the classes. I am planning to go home as I don't think classes will be resumed in offline mode anytime soon. If they take classes in online mode then I can do that from my home, why will I pay rent here?\" Kuldeep, a UPSC aspirant residing in Rajinder Nagar, said.\n\nThe Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has intensified its sealing drive, targeting areas housing coaching centers. Recently, the focus shifted to Preet Vihar in east Delhi, following the sealing of 20 basements in Mukherjee Nagar and Rajinder Nagar for unauthorized commercial activities. This crackdown comes in the wake of a devastating incident where three civil services aspirants lost their lives due to a flooded drain at Rau's IAS Study Circle.\n\nThe victims, identified as Shreya Yadav from Uttar Pradesh, Tanya Soni from Telangana, and Navin Dalwin from Kerala, tragically died as water inundated the basement library. The MCD's efforts aim to prevent such mishaps by ensuring compliance with regulations and preventing the misuse of spaces for commercial purposes.\n\nAs the sealing drive continues in various parts of the city, the authorities remain vigilant in enforcing safety measures and upholding building standards to safeguard residents and businesses.", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajinder_Nagar_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajinder Nagar Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukherjee_Nagar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mukherjee Nagar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(emblem)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seal (emblem)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preet_Vihar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preet Vihar"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoghar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deoghar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deoghar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Jujutsu", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Jujutsu", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Yoga", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Yoga", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Reiki", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Reiki", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Krav_Maga", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Krav Maga", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/students-protests-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775565", "eventUri": "eng-9775565", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

IAS/IPS, or broadly UPSC, is one of those examinations in India that every candidate once dreamed of and a myriad of students every year come to Delhi to enrol in the coaching centres that 'claim to provide excellence to these candidates and make them ready to pass these toughest examinations of the nation'.\n\nNot only in Delhi and not only in UPSC but all over the nation, probably in every urban region, you have seen gigantic hoardings of coaching centres that aim to give excellent education and guidance services to your wards to crack the UPSC, NEET, JEE examinations that will pave their way to an astounding future.\n\nBut what happened in the last few months unfolded that how these coaching centres are merely doing business in the name of education, and they are least bothered by what happens with your kids in these institutions. From running misleading advertisements without thinking about how they will affect the aspirants, to allegedly putting out the answer key just 30 minutes after the exam in the NEET exam (scam), in exchange for money to running classes in basements ignoring safety, these institutions have crossed every limit to earn profit on the cost of safety and security of the future of the nation.\n\nThe recent accident of 3 aspirants, identified as Shriya, Naveen, and Tania, killed in the Old Rajinder Nagar coaching centre is not a new phenomenon that happened suddenly. Just a week ago, a similar aspirant, where 26-year-old Neelesh Rai, returning to his room through a waterlogged street, died from electrocution. Even after witnessing such a situation that could pose a threat to the safety of the students, the national capital authorities seem to be less bothered to examine the situation, which could have prevented the recent deaths of these 3 aspirants.\n\nMoreover, this coaching centre under scanner had a library in the basement, which, as per Delhi Mayor Shelly Oberoi, is illegal as it has been acknowledged that commercial activity in basements is illegal. Rent on the upper floors is costlier; hence, libraries were positioned in the basements. Furthermore, isn't that ironic that this coaching centre, which was teaching the UPSC aspirants to become coveted bureaucrats of the nation who will ensure the law and order of society, is themselves involved in illegal activities like the basement library? Seems like 'Teach what you preach' is just a phrase meant to be broken by the teachers themselves!\n\nThe only plus point is that they have an AC room, so you don't really need ventilation, but there is no scope for running away in case of an emergency. These all point towards the building's infrastructure, including the absence of fire exits, poor ventilation, and a single spiral staircase, jeopardising the safety and security of those aspirants who have spent lakhs of rupees in getting enrolled in these coaching centres and dreamt of having studies and getting a batter future from there.\n\nIn April of this year, a major fire broke out from an electric transformer inside a five-story boys' hostel building in Landmark City in Kota, resulting in burn injuries to at least six coaching students. Two students suffered leg injuries after jumping from the first floor in an attempt to escape the flames. Rakesh Vyas, fire officer of Kota Municipal Corporation, stated that the hostel building was not fitted with fire safety measures and lacked a fire NOC. Additionally, the transformer in the hostel was situated on the ground level near the stairs.\n\nAccording to Kota chief fire officer Gautam Lal, a fire safety audit of 605 high-rise structures undertaken in March 2019 revealed that around 90% of buildings, institutes, and hostels lacked fire safety equipment or had defective fire safety systems. Imagine the fate of the safety of your kids in such hazardous situations! Even Naveen Mittal, the then President of the Kota Hostel Association, stated that in older structures, hostel proprietors are not even aware of fire precautions.\n\nA fire broke out three months ago in one of Old Rajinder Nagar's hostel buildings. Prior to this occurrence, another fire broke out in one of the libraries, although nobody was hurt. In another attempt from last year, students were seen from jumping from the building to escape a fire in Mukherjee Nagar.\n\nEven In May of this year, the Delhi High Court asked the MCD and DDA to immediately shut coaching institutions that violate fire safety regulations. A court led by Justice Yashwant Varma, who had previously ordered an investigation of coaching centres in Mukherjee Nagar, also directed the authorities to relocate any potentially harmful electrical equipment put outside the premises. Amicus curiae Gautam Narayan informed the court that, despite the MCD's claims that several coaching facilities had been closed, they had been proven to be running under new management or names. These facilities were discovered to be non-compliant with fire safety regulations, with one even having an electrical board obstructing the door.\n\nThis terrible occurrence is not a unique one from Delhi. Similar incidents of neglect by coaching institutes and hostel administrators have endangered students' lives several times in the past. Their living circumstances are currently in the limelight, but years of complaints have gone unanswered by the mafia-like nexus of coaching institutions, brokers, and landlords. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE REPEATEDLY IGNORED SERIOUS WARNINGS.\n\nA major fire damaged the Takshashila complex in Surat, killing 22 students. The fire began on the first floor after a spark in an air conditioner's exterior unit and spread quickly owing to highly combustible components and the wooden staircase. The majority of students died from suffocation or by jumping off the building. These buildings didn't even have a Fire NOC. Following the tragedy, police arrested 14 people, including Surat Fire and Emergency Services personnel and the building's developers. However, they are out on bail.\n\nOf course, as seen from the famous case of the Pune Porshe accident, where the murderer of two was granted bail on the condition of writing an essay, no doubt, bail is the reward that the Indian judiciary gives to anyone who is accused of taking the lives of people. This is the supreme justice of the biggest democracy in the world.\n\nMoreover, the judge asserted the question, 'What will people on the streets do? People visiting pubs are not going to go home walking. Something needs to change in this situation! Seems like there is no concept of accountability and punishment in our nation, so similar heinous incidents should not be repeated in future! This reminds me of a joke by comedian Abhishek Upmanyi saying '\u0924\u0941\u092e \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u0905\u092a\u0928\u0940 body \u0932\u0947\u0915\u0947 \u092c\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u0918\u0942\u092e\u094b\u0917\u0947 \u0924\u094b criminal \u0924\u094b \u0915\u093e\u091f \u0939\u0940 \u0926\u0947\u0917\u093e \u0928 '!\n\nAlso, justice delayed is justice denied- Five years on, the parents of the deceased are still fighting for justice. Jayshukh Gajera, father of a deceased student in 2019, said on May 24, 2024, to a news outlet, \"What is the point of justice if it is served after 15 or 20 years of the incident? This incident was one of the biggest tragedies of the country, but it is not being run in fast track court despite our demands,\". Imagine sending your child to a coaching centre for a better future and then waiting helplessly to get justice for those departed souls.\n\nAlso, this is not only the case in Gujarat, where the building lacks the proper safety for any potential fire hazard. Recall the accident from May, where a gaming zone fire from Gujarat's Rajkot killed 27 persons. As known from the sources, the gaming zone did not apply for a fire safety certificate till this year, the Gujarat High Court was told. Following this incident, even the Gujarat High Court bashed the state government that they could not be trusted anymore because of these hazardous fire lapses. Now, think about whether you have ever applauded Gujarat's model of development.\n\nThese incidents are not the scenes from just a handful of years. Even a decade ago as well, similar incidents of fire broke out in the coaching institute of Jaipur in 2014. In that case also, the fire broke out in basement, where classes were being taken to put the foundation of the future of the nation! The then-Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) sealed the coaching facility building because it was functioning illegally.\n\nIn 2018, Jaipur Chief Fire Officer Jagdish Phulwaria stated that the Jaipur Municipal Corporation conducted a safety assessment of such coaching schools in 2018, with 100 receiving notices for violating fire safety standards. The fire department issued No Objection Certificates to 10 of the approximately 50 institutes judged to be lawful. This same person, in August 2022, was nabbed for taking bribes for issuing a fire No Objection Certificate (NOC) to a firm that has installed some fire equipment at a few places. According to investigations, Phulwariya reportedly asked applicants seeking NOC to purchase fire equipment from a company run by his son.\n\nAccording to the ACB director general BL Soni, a complainant approached the headquarters and said that the chief fire officer demanded a payment of Rs 1 lakh to issue a fire NOC. It was anticipated that at least 5000 buildings were under Phulwaria, for which he was issuing fresh NOCs or conducting renewal of expiring NOCs. It sounds like corruption is deeply rooted in the blood and minds of Indians.\n\nNow again, in 2024, the Jaipur police have ordered a thorough inspection of safety measures in all coaching institutes across the city and have established helpline numbers for students and parents to report issues in response to the recent waterlogging incident in a Delhi coaching centre's basement. The Jaipur police have set up several reporting channels to make this easier. God only knows how the authorities, if ever, could find routes to tackle these corrupt practices.\n\nThe incident of the illegal hoarding collapse tragedy that killed 17 persons in the Ghatkopar area of Mumbai is a recent example of such negligence. Later, media houses reported that the owner of the billboard agency was arrested, but the question lies in how the municipal authority or the collector or commissioner of the city could not take action against such a hoarding that was standing illegally for such a long time. Why such a situation of bureaucratic lapse?\n\nTake another example of the collapse of illegal buildings in various states, be it the recent incident of the illegal building collapsing in Navi Mumbai a couple of days back, the illegal building collapse in Kolkata in March 2024, or the dilapidated three-story building collapse in Gujarat in July 2024.\n\nThe question arises:\n\nWhat are the people in charge, and what are the municipal authorities doing? Why has the collector/commissioner/authority in charge not taken cognisance of illegal constructions in this city?\n\nOr why the mayor of the concerned city, who is called the city's first decision, has not taken immediate action to demolish these illegal constructions?\n\nIronically, 'bulldozer justice in India' is only triggered by communal clashes or towards specific communal sections of society!\n\nIn each case, one can see that there is a major sort of bureaucratic lapse at every stage where authorities were seen not taking appropriate actions even after hazards were observed and were neglected, which eventually led to the loss of the common man. Not even only the coaching institutes, but at every point, we could see how these officers who are actually given duty and paid great bucks to run the city are ignoring their responsibilities and not at the end.\n\nMoreover, as per a recent update, a man has been arrested in this case of Delhi's coaching centre killing three lives, mentioning that video footage shows the man driving the vehicle very fast, due to which the gate of the coaching centre broke, and water gushed into the basement area! The charges on which he was arrested that BNS Section 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).\n\nGoing by that theory, the biometric system company, which installed a biometric system at the coaching centre that failed at the moment should also be charged! How ironically, the authorities shifted the blame to any random person, ignoring that it was they, 'the authorities' whose negligence cost the lives of those 3 aspirants!\n\nAnu Lall, an educator, podcast host, and coach, how beautifully explained that whosoever the government is, be it AAP, BJP or Congress, in the end, the 'babus' of the city should be held accountable for anything and everything that goes wrong in the city. Of course, what would a common man can expect from Indian bureaucracy if they have officers like Puja Khedkar, who are just there to rust the 'Steel Frame of India'!\n\nMoreover, only politics is being done at every level just to shift the blame game, and in the end, the lives of the common man, who is paying huge taxes, are neglected like anything.\n\nTo sum up.\n\nDespite these frequent events, governments and administrations have turned a blind eye to the problem and have enabled these coaching institutes to thrive. People frequently forget and go on, so lost lives are only numbers. There has never been any responsibility for government officials, municipal corporation employees, or fire department personnel, while only those who operate or own the structure face the ire of the law.\n\nThe governments must address the issue and undertake rigorous inspections of the residential/commercial premises in which such institutions operate. Until then, we will continue to see tragedies similar to those in Surat or Delhi coaching centres, and young kids will be viewed as numbers rather than India's future. This shows how the blind eye by the babus of today, aka the lack of administration of the present authorities, is murdering the administrators of tomorrow!", "source": {"uri": "inventiva.co.in",

Its growth is projected to reach Rs 1,33,995 crore rupees by 2028. But there is no formal rule or Act that regulates their formation or operation in India. Although the Ministry of Education had come up with some model guidelines for the centers to follow in January 2024, their implementation or compliance is far from being monitored.\n\nNew Delhi: Shreya Yadav, Nivin Dalwin and Tanya Soni -- three names that will reverberate with us forever. On Saturday evening, these three UPSC aspirants died after a library housed in the basement of Rau's IAS Study Circle flooded during heavy rainfall in the National Capital Region. They were all under 30, they all had a bright chance at making something of their lives. But instead they found themselves drowning in dirty, unhygienic water that flooded the congested by-lanes of old Rajinder Nagar, a popular hotspot for UPSC coaching in Delhi. Since then, authorities have sealed many more such copious coaching centers in the area, have made arrests in the case, politicians are making this into a plausible issue, the blame game has begun, and every guideline is being scrutinised. Nothing new, because come September coaching centers will be back in business, luring more students to join them for \"assured admission\" in an institute or a job of prominence.\n\nSo the vicious circle continues, and all the debates become mere folderols.\n\nIf we leave aside tragedies in coaching centers due to infrastructural problems, related deaths paint another sordid picture. According to police data (that is mostly available for Kota in Rajasthan), 15 students died by suicide in Kota in 2022, 18 in 2019, 20 in 2018, seven in 2017, 17 in 2016, and 18 in 2015 and 26 students lost their lives in 2023. These deaths have been accounted to centers who put undue pressure on their students to benefit their selfish motives -- more achievements, more students, more money.\n\nTo have a stronghold on all the misuse by private coaching institutes in India, the Union government had in January 2024 released guidelines for regulations of private coaching centers operating in India. These were supposed to be model guidelines that other states were to follow but is it being implemented? If not, is there some kind of a monitoring system in place?\n\nWhat happens to 'model guidelines' set by Ministry of Education?\n\nThe guidelines involved strict compliance of rules for registration of coaching centers, regulating fees that can be charged from students, building and other infrastructural norms to be adhered to, counseling to be made mandatory, even mental health and stress management rules that a center needs to abide by. The said guidelines also had an age criteria for admission into a coaching institute. On paper, the rules were lauded by academicians, some even went to the extent of calling it a game-changer in the Indian education space.\n\nBut hardly six months down the line we are faced with glaring loopholes in monitoring and evaluation of the guidelines. According to the general secretary of Coaching Federation of India, Krishna Chaitanya Kasula, the guidelines introduced by Government of India in 2024 is not an Act which mandates compliance. \"At present, these are only model guidelines,\" he elaborates.\n\nKasula also has an observation on the tragic incident of Saturday. \"Coaching centers are forced to operate in limited spaces due to high demand and constrained availability. The exorbitant rental values in these areas compel institutes to settle for congested classrooms, which significantly impacts the quality of education and the well-being of students. We urge the government to consider creating additional infrastructure with adequate facilities to address these pressing issues and ensure a safer, more conducive learning environment,\" he says in his appeal.\n\nAccording to the new guidelines, each student should have a minimum of one square meter of space allotted during a class and coaching centers must provide infrastructure proportional to the number of students enrolled. However, the majority of\n\ntutorials fall short of meeting these standards. \"Forget about providing a minimum 1 square meter area for each student, coaching classes are running in small rooms where there is not even proper ventilation,\" said Neetiesh Gupta, a father of a student.\n\nGuidelines also mandate that coaching centers adhere to fire safety codes, building safety codes, and obtain the relevant certificates from appropriate authorities. Nevertheless, many coaching centers fail to meet these requirements. And without a strict Act in place, it is difficult for the government to monitor the progress made by centers and if the rules are being flouted in the first place.\n\nWhile making the guidelines a law in the country is the ideal solution, academicians also propose that the government create facilities to accommodate students, which can be rented out to faculty or coaching centers. \"This may significantly reduce costs for aspirants and allow teachers and coaching owners to focus on delivering quality education without the burden of high operational costs,\" adds Kasula.\n\nIs it time for a legal regulation for private coaching centers?\n\nWhile the number of schools and quality of teaching in schools has grown in proportion and the number of seats has increased significantly, we still see mushrooming of coaching institutes and tuition centers. The question is, why? What has changed is the mindset of our society with growing purchasing power. But with all the ruckus caused in (and around coaching institutes) in India, is it time for the stakeholders to make proper laws that regulate such private teaching institutions and have monitoring committees in place to monitor their activities?\n\nSome feel it may be nearly impossible to bring forth a strict law to govern all the coaching institutes primarily because of the volume of students who attend such extra classes these days (from class 9th onward), the fact that such centers have proliferated in the last decade and also the nexus that exists between people of power and those who own popular branches of coaching institutes in India.\n\nHowever, such tragic instances like the one that happened in New Delhi may make parents anxious that nothing is being done to safeguard the health of their wards. In this case, will the present dispensation, or the opposition, or someone take heed and made amends to this facet of Indian education? Only time will tell.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deebashree_mohanty@news9live.com", "name": "Deebashree Mohanty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Education (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota,_Rajasthan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kota, Rajasthan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kota, Rajasthan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital_Region_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Capital Region (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_hotspot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biodiversity hotspot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitanya_Mahaprabhu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chaitanya Mahaprabhu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fire safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(electoral_subdivision)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ward (electoral subdivision)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventilation (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Purchasing power"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 23}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Coaching-center.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775565", "eventUri": "eng-9775565", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 83, "textEnd": 90}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

A team was formed on Monday to compile data and visit the sites to check the present safety measures in place, they added.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav emphasised the urgency of this directive and a comprehensive review of safety measures at coaching institutes. He said, \"The safety and well-being of our students is our top priority. We cannot afford to be complacent. Every coaching centre must comply with safety norms to avoid such tragic incidents. To begin with, we will compile the list of coaching institutes that are operating from basements.\"\n\nDistrict administration officials reported that private institutes do not require any license to operate, and hence there is no exact data available. The team will conduct a survey and submit a report within 30 days, they said, adding that at least 600 institutes are operational across the city.\n\nAdditionally, DC Yadav said the safety audits will focus on structural safety, emergency exits, fire safety, flood preparedness, first aid and medical facilities.\n\n\"Ensuring that the buildings are structurally sound and can withstand heavy rains and potential flooding is a primary concern. The audits will verify that all coaching centres have clearly marked, and accessible emergency exits. Additionally, the presence of functional fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and clear evacuation plans will be checked. Flood preparedness measures, such as the adequacy of drainage systems and the presence of sump pumps in basements to prevent water accumulation, will also be assessed,\" said Yadav.\n\nThe administration has mandated regular safety drills and training sessions for staff and students. These drills aim to familiarise everyone with emergency procedures and ensure swift evacuations if necessary.\n\nParents and students have expressed concerns and relief over the new measures. Ritu Yadav, a parent of an aspiring civil servant, said, \"It is a necessary step. The Delhi incident has raised many questions about the coaching centres operating without any safety protocols. The city already has waterlogging issues, and such a situation can arise any day during monsoons. Gurugram institutes are mostly running from residential areas and out of homes, which is a prime concern for parents now since the classes are held from basements.\"\n\nLokesh Kumar, owner of a prominent coaching centre in Sector 14, Gurgaonsaid, \"We welcome the audits and are committed to providing a safe learning environment for our students.

In Jaipur, the Police Commissioner has sought information from all the police stations about the security measures in the coaching centers running in their area, whereas in Kota, the libraries running in the basements are being seized.\n\nCoaching Centres In Rajasthan\n\nThe coaching centers are running in almost every. City of Rajasthan but Kota, Jaipur, and Sikar are the major coaching hubs. Kota is known for its preparation for the NEET-IIT entrance exam. The Capital city of Jaipur has centers for all types of coaching right from the preparation of civil services to government recruitments and the NEET-IIT entrance exam, while Sikar has emerged as a new coaching hub, especially for government recruitments.\n\nKota has been a coaching hub for decades and students from every corner of the country come to study here. The big brands have all the facilities and fulfill all the norms, but the problem is with small coaching centers as they have limited resources. In some places, classes are being held in the basement of the building, while some have libraries or reading rooms.\n\nNot only the coaching centers but the hostels and PGs are also running libraries or reading rooms in the basements of their buildings.\n\nMost of the hostels and other residential buildings located in Jawahar Nagar, Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, Coral Park, Landmark etc. in the city have made basements in their homes.\n\nThere are more than 400 basements. Earlier, most of them used to have messes, but after the incidents of fire in the messes and considering safety, now the fire NOC is being issued only after taking an undertaking of not using the basements for mess or other commercial activities. When the corporation closed the mess, the basement remained vacant, so the operators gave it on lease for the library and other works. The students who do not have a separate room or suitable environment for studies in house, hostel or PG, they go to these libraries or reading rooms to study. There are facilities for internet, Wi-Fi, AC-fan, light etc.\n\nMost of the basements are in narrow lanes and have no emergency exits. Electrical panels and wires are lying open and seepage from the drain is coming inside.\n\nTalking of Jaipur, most of the coaching centers in the city are in Tonk Phatak and Gopalpura Road area with hundreds of hostels and PGs running in almost the same situation as Kota.\n\nA Separate Coaching Hub Developed In Pratap Nagar Of Jaipur\n\nThe government has developed a separate coaching hub with all the required facilities in the Pratap Nagar area of the city, but the coaching centers are not ready to move there as the present location is in the middle of the city.\n\n\"The government has developed a coaching hub, but we have bought our present premises at very high rates, and now it is not possible for us to buy other premises in the coaching hub,\" said a coaching center owner on anonymity.\n\nSikar is comparatively a small city but emerging as a big hub of coaching for government recruitments, but the coaching centers here lack basic facilities for the students. There is water logging in the streets of coaching centers. These streets are so narrow that the fire brigade vehicles will not be able to enter.\n\nHowever, the administration has awakened after the incident in Delhi and action is being taken on the building that is not fulfilling the norms.\n\nRakesh Vyas, the Chief Fire Officer of Kota Municipal Corporation said that security arrangements are being reviewed. The teams of the municipal corporation have seized 14 libraries running in the basement. The action has been taken at those places where there is a possibility of water logging and there is a drain passing nearby.\n\nIn Jaipur, the Additional Commissioner of Police Kunwar Rashtradeep has directed all the police stations to send a report regarding the safety arrangements in the coaching centers in their areas in two days. Some mobile numbers have also been made public where a complaint can be lodged regarding the violation of safety norms.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jaipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota,_Rajasthan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kota, Rajasthan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kota, Rajasthan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sikar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sikar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_inspector_general_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deputy inspector general of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipal corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fire department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonk,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonk, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tonk, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-07/6a13b50c-06b9-4f86-8773-de012033ad69/Untitled design (8).png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775565", "eventUri": "eng-9775565", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jaipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

There are other centres, which are located in such narrow lanes that it would be difficult for the fire department to reach the place.Jharkhand Coaching Association member Dr S D Mishra said there is a need to conduct mock drills on fire safety measures for students.

Politicians and municipal officials are locked in a blame game, pointing fingers at each other. India Today correspondents Sushant Mehra and Nitin Jain launched an investigation to locate the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) Councillor responsible for the area's civic issues.\n\nHere is their comprehensive report:\n\nDespite numerous attempts, India Today TV was unable to contact Arti Chawla, the MCD Councillor from Rajinder Nagar. Unanswered calls to both her and her husband, Rajat Chawla, left the team without answers. Even two days after the incident, Councillor Chawla failed to attend the MCD meeting convened on Monday to address the tragedy. The India Today team then decided to visit the Councillor's house.\n\nIndia Today TV visited the official address of Councillor Arti Chawla at 18/3, Second Floor, Old Rajinder Nagar, only to uncover that the location operates as a Paying Guest (PG) accommodation for IAS aspirants.\n\nThe location is a short walk from the Rau's Academy, where the tragic drowning occurred.\n\nOur team interviewed students residing at the address. Here is a transcript of the conversation:\n\nLocals allege that the building is in violation of MCD building bylaws. The small rooms, measuring just 10 feet by 10 feet, are shared by two students and include an attached toilet. Narrow stairways and a lack of fire exits pose serious risks. In the event of a major accident, evacuating the students would be nearly impossible.\n\nThe flooding of a coaching centre's basement in the Old Rajinder Nagar area claimed the lives of three UPSC aspirants. The basement was being used as a library by the coaching centre owners.\n\nTill now, seven people, including the owners and coordinator of the coaching centre as well the four co-owners of the basement of the coaching centre, have been arrested. The seventh arrested accused is the man who drove his SUV through the flooded street, exacerbating the situation.\n\nHowever, no officer of the municipal corporation or bureaucrat has yet come under police heat yet.\n\nNotably, the authorities' negligence is not restricted to this matter. A few days before the flooded basement killed three students, another civil aspirant had died due to electrocution as he was crossing a waterlogged street.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Human Rights Commission has issued notices to the Delhi government, city police chief and municipal commissioner over the three students' death in the coaching centre basement and sought a detailed report from them in two weeks.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajinder_Nagar_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajinder Nagar Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councillor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Councillor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India Today (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Commissioner_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Commissioner (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Human_Rights_Commission_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Human Rights Commission of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucrat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucrat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipal corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/delhi-coaching-deaths-315214645-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=ef3wflKpScjUfls5LE.zMvJdCk2kfXO0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775565", "eventUri": "eng-9775565", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

About 25 years ago, India's burgeoning youth population was seen as a distinct advantage compared to other emerging superpowers like China. All it took to dismantle these notions was a week in Delhi.\n\nOur demographic dividend comes with a hefty price tag, payable in young lives. On the morning of July 22, Nilesh Rai was a UPSC aspirant with a bright future. By the afternoon, he was a statistic in Delhi's monsoon deaths of 2024. The 26-year-old was returning to his PG accommodation in South Patel Nagar -- a hub for UPSC hopefuls attending coaching institutes in nearby Old Rajinder Nagar -- when he was electrocuted. A ghastly photograph of Rai's body, slumped over an iron gate with a tangle of serpentine wires above him, was a haunting snapshot of the high-stakes roulette ordinary Indians are coerced into playing.\n\nAlso read: NEET, JEE exams are causing a mental health crisis in India. Students are struggling to cope\n\nRai's tragic end serves as a grim reminder that, in the pursuit of success, our youth are navigating a minefield of neglect and indifference. Less than a week later, three young aspirants in Old Rajinder Nagar met a horrific end when they drowned in the flooded basement of Rau's IAS Study Circle. The three -- Shreya Yadav from Uttar Pradesh, Nivin Dalwin from Kerala, and Tanya Soni from Telangana -- had moved to the city to pursue their dreams of civil services.\n\nThese dreams and lives were snuffed out by the coaching centre's brazen disregard for basic safety, with their ambitions drowned alongside their bodies. According to the completion certificate for the building that the centre was operating out of, the basement was designated as parking space and general storage but was being used as a library. Multiple reminders to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi about the basement's misuse went unanswered.\n\nRau's IAS is hardly an anomaly; a simple walk around Old Rajinder Nagar reveals numerous violations of building norms. The incident has sparked a predictable blame game among the state and central governments, as well as the MCD. There are student protests, calls for resignations, and demands for compensation for the deceased students. The Delhi Police has made five arrests, including the four building owners and the driver of an SUV who damaged the gate that led to the flooding.\n\nThe number of arrests made in the MCD? Zero. This speaks volumes about our broken system of accountability, where those tasked with preventing such tragedies seem to be above reproach.\n\nThese tragedies are the inevitable result of a toxic brew: institutional negligence mixed with the ruthless exploitation of young, desperate aspirants. Between 2014 and 2022, 22 crore people applied for government jobs, but only 7.22 lakh were selected. In such a fiercely competitive environment, what choice do the students have but to fall prey to the predatory tactics of coaching institutes?\n\nTouts patrol metro stations in Delhi, hoping to draw aspirants to coaching centres. Late last year, the Central Consumer Protection Authority brought 20 coaching institutes under the microscope, for making misleading claims to attract aspirants and imposed a Rs 1 lakh penalty on four centres, including Rau's IAS Study Circle. For an industry estimated to generate revenue of Rs 58,088 crore, this penalty is chump change. Internet forums are full of horror stories about expensive classes, terrible teaching practices, and a quagmire that sucks in a young, gullible population.\n\nDespite multiple government advisories to regulate the coaching centre industry, they have been ignored. After all, why regulate a cash cow when you can milk it dry?\n\nCoaching centres in India are an open wound that everyone sees festering but no one dares to stitch up. Meanwhile, the body count rises. In Kota, the hub for JEE and NEET aspirants, many of whom are still teenagers, a staggering 147 students have died by suicide since 2014 -- 30 of those suicides occurred in 2023 alone. To avoid the stain of suicide, coaching centres often fail to report such incidents to the authorities. In response, the government has scrambled to draft guidelines like UMMEED (Understand, Motivate, Manage, Empathise, Empower, Develop) to prevent student self-harm.\n\nAlso read: Feel free to hit my child -- Indian parents' ground rule for good education. Toxic teachers oblige\n\nWe have entered a nightmarish realm where district administrations have mandated hostels to install \"anti-suicide fans\" and wire mesh on balconies to prevent students from taking their lives. Because nothing spells \"we care about mental health\" quite like turning hostels into padded cells.\n\nThis is the price of ambition in young India. These aspirants, our supposed demographic dividend, are paying for their dreams with their sanity, their health, and sometimes their lives. They cram into dingy PG accommodations, subsist on meagre meals, and drown in endless study materials -- all for a shot at a government job they are statistically unlikely to get. The quest for hallowed \"job security\" leads them down an increasingly precarious path.\n\nWe've shoved millions of young people onto a tightrope over an abyss with no safety net. And yet, they keep coming -- these bright-eyed aspirants, ready to gamble their lives on the slim chance of becoming the next district collector or sub-divisional magistrate. In a country with rampant unemployment, even this deadly game seems like a rational choice.\n\nThis should shame us. Instead, we applaud the valorisation of students' struggle in films like 12th Fail and web series like Aspirants. But how can there be any critical examination of this system when these are funded by the likes of Unacademy and represent the interests of the coaching industry? It's like asking the tobacco industry to support anti-smoking campaigns.\n\nStill, a demographic advantage can only become a dividend when there are jobs to match it. Somehow, over the last two decades, we've arrived at a point where 66 per cent of India's unemployed are educated, with the unemployment rate among graduates standing at almost 30 per cent.\n\nIn this scenario, government jobs don't just represent security; they also become a marker of respect. Data scientist and development economist Kunal Mangal, who has studied India's labour market extensively, explained that \"government officers are treated with extreme deference, especially in rural areas -- and candidates typically belong to communities where the only way of obtaining this kind of social standing is [through] government employment. While some part of chasing government jobs is being attracted to the benefits, some of it is being repelled by conditions in the private sector.\"\n\nThe tragic irony is that our demographic dividend, once heralded as India's ticket to superpower status, is now drowning in basements and hanging from anti-suicide fans. We've created a system where our youth's potential is measured not by their creativity or innovation but by their ability to survive a gauntlet of exams, mental health crises, awful living conditions, and rapacious, negligent coaching centres that ignore the most basic norms.\n\nThis recent tragedy is a reminder that our real \"dividend\" lies not in the quantity of our youth but in the quality of opportunities we provide them. Until then, we're not nurturing a workforce for the future; we're cultivating a generation of disillusioned, desperate job-seekers. And that's a demographic time bomb no number of coaching centres can defuse.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It is estimated that there are around 600 such institutes in the city.\n\nThe safety audits will address several key areas, including structural integrity, emergency exits, fire safety, flood preparedness, and medical facilities. \"Ensuring that buildings can withstand heavy rains and flooding is a major concern,\" Yadav explained. \"The audits will check that coaching centres have well-marked and accessible emergency exits, functional fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, and effective evacuation plans. We will also evaluate flood preparedness measures like drainage systems and sump pumps in basements.\"\n\nRegular safety drills for both students and staffers\n\nAdditionally, the administration has mandated regular safety drills and training for both staff and students. These drills are intended to ensure everyone is familiar with emergency procedures and can evacuate efficiently if necessary.\n\nThe new measures have been well received by parents and students. Ritu Yadav, a parent of an aspiring civil servant, commented, \"This is a necessary step. The Delhi incident has raised serious concerns about coaching centres lacking proper safety protocols. Given Gurugram's waterlogging issues, such problems could arise during the monsoon season. Many institutes operate from basements in residential areas, which is a significant concern.\"\n\nLokesh Kumar, the owner of a leading coaching centre in Sector 14, Gurugram, welcomed the safety audits. \"We support the audits and are dedicated to providing a safe environment for our students.

The students have been protesting because they believe that their demands have not been met yet.\n\nRobin, a student who is part of the protest, said, \"We were given assurance when the fire incident happened in 'Sanskriti IAS', but the coaching institutes opened again after one week. We don't want to weaken our protest just after hearing the assurances. We don't want assurances; we want our demands to be fulfilled. We want action\".\n\n\"Police tried to manipulate to take back the protest. It's not a small issue. Three students have done so. The protest going on is at a small level; the protest should occur on a large scale. We are not going to withdraw the protest unit unless our demands have been met,\" he added.\n\nA student stated that they are in talks with the authorities and the work for some of their demands has started\n\n\"We are holding regular talks with the Delhi Police. We will also bring new demands. Officials are working to resolve some of the demands,\" she said.\n\n\"When we started the protest, we decided to be peaceful because we are Civil Service aspirants and our way of dissent and protest has always been passive restraint. We have the assurance that our demands will be fulfilled but it's time to see how they will meet our demands. 13-18 students are sitting here on a hunger strike. We are not even going to take water until and unless our demands have been met,\" she added.\n\nThe protesting students however say they will not stop other students from going to the institutes or colleges.\n\n\"We don't want our protest to obstruct public lives by any means. especially, we don't want to put children into problems. Our gates will be opened when school students come and go then we will again close the gates\", a protesting student said.\n\nMeanwhile, additional DCP Central Sachin Sharma assured students that the actions have been initiated by the concerned authorities to fulfil their demands\n\n\"A lot of false messages are circulating on social media and people are believing them, related to casualties or biometrics. We are trying to tell them the proper facts. We are also telling them about the action being taken by the government agencies. The LG also held a meeting last evening and the representatives of the students attended it. Action is being initiated on their demands by concerned authorities,\" additional DCP Central Sachin Sharma said.\n\nOn Tuesday, students and representatives of 15 coaching institutions met the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi, Vinai Kumar Saxena, at his house.\n\nA student who was in the meeting said \"We demanded 3 crore compensation for the students who died in the incidents, though the coaching centre has not disclosed the compensation amount but they have agreed to pay the compensation\".\n\n\"Representatives of coaching institutes asked to make a bridge between the institute and students so that they can pay the compensation money. LG sir assured us that a committee will be formed, where student representatives of coaching institutes and government officials will be part of that group, this committee will hear the concerns of the students, and the committee will check whether the norms of the buildings are being followed properly or not,\" the student added.\n\nEarlier, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) issued notices to the Delhi Chief Secretary, the Police Commissioner, and the MCD Commissioner on Tuesday, calling for a detailed report on the matter within two weeks. The NHRC also directed a survey to identify the number of such institutes and coaching centres operating in violation of prescribed norms in the national capital and to take action against negligent officers failing to address these irregularities.

However, this dream turned into a nightmare when three IAS aspirants lost their lives due to flooding in an illegal basement of a coaching center during Saturday's heavy downpour.\n\nIndia Today correspondents Nitin Jain and Sushant Mehra uncover the grim realities behind Delhi's reputed coaching centers.\n\nThe investigation begins at the service lane behind Rau's IAS coaching center, where an illegal basement houses eight small wooden cubicles, each rented out for 10,000 rupees. These cramped, damp rooms are where students, aspiring to join the civil services, are forced to study under dire conditions.\n\nOur reporters spoke to students living in these basements:\n\nReporter: What is the rent for this basement?\n\nStudent: Rs 10,000 rupees.\n\nReporter: How many rooms are there?\n\nStudent: Eight.\n\nReporter: So the total rent for this basement is Rs 80,000?\n\nStudent: Yes.\n\nMoving to the upscale Karol Bagh area, we examine a grand building at 6/36 Channa Market. Prior to the basement tragedy, this location seemed above board, and the students were made to cought up hefty amount to rent rooms here.\n\nBut recent events have forced a hurried evacuation.\n\nReporter: Can I get a PG here?\n\nCaretaker: There's no PG available; it's been vacated.\n\nReporter: It was available before?\n\nCaretaker: Yes, the basement has been emptied.\n\nReporter: What was the rent?\n\nCaretaker: It was Rs 10,000 without food and Rs 15,000 with food. Students were taking both options.\n\nStudents, who until recently were crammed into PVC cubicles measuring just 10 feet by 6 feet, now face sudden eviction. The recent death of three students in the coaching centre basement has propelled the administration into action, and the landlords, in turn, have kicked out students overnight,\n\nBut a look at the rooms where students were made to cram paints a picture of misery. Each set of 10 rooms shared one kitchen and one toilet, with electricity billed at Rs 12 per unit.\n\nReporter: There is one toilet for all these cubicles? And what about electricity?\n\nCaretaker: Yes, Rs 12 per unit for electricity.\n\nReporter: Right. It's barely 6 feet by 8 feet per room.\n\nCaretaker: We had closed it before; then they had installed it in between.\n\nReporter: These are PVC?\n\nCaretaker: Yes, there weren't many students here, so we hadn't installed it yet. We faced water issues before in the basement.\n\nThese basements have long faced water issues, but landlords, driven by the lure of rental income, continue to jeopardize student safety. The greed of rental money turns these landlords into perpetrators of a dangerous environment for students.\n\nA local library, previously operating in the basement, was also part of our investigation. Our undercover reporter inquired about its reopening:\n\nReporter: I wanted to enroll students in the library.\n\nDeshmukh (Library owner): It will move to another place; we are currently cleaning it.\n\nReporter: What are the charges?\n\nDeshmukh: Rs 2,500.\n\nReporter: So it will open tomorrow?\n\nDeshmukh: Yes, it will open tomorrow.\n\nReporter: Is there an AC and other facilities?\n\nDeshmukh: Yes, everything is there.\n\nDespite the evident dangers and the recent tragedy serving a warning, illegal basements continue to operate openly in these areas, seemingly unnoticed by the authorities responsible for enforcing the law.\n\nThe death of three students on Saturday due to flooding of a library, located in the basement of a coaching centre, has posed a lot of questions. The tragedy has forced the administration into actions. Seven people, including the owner and coordinator of the coaching centre as well as the owners of the basement, have been arrested. An SUV driver who had waded through the flooded street on the fateful day, and ended up making the situation worse, has also been arrested in connection with the case.\n\nThe chief secretary has directed the central district magistrate to ascertain the cause of coaching centre flooding incident and fix the responsibility of the people concerned.\n\nThe Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) also launched a crackdown on coaching institutes and sealed illegally-run basements, as well as demolished encroachment done on stormwater drains to prevent waterlogging. The civic body carried its sealing drive in Rajinder Nagar, Mukherjee Nagar, and east Delhi's Preet Vihar.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Postgraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajinder_Nagar_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajinder Nagar Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_chloride", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polyvinyl chloride"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol_Bagh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karol Bagh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karol Bagh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukherjee_Nagar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mukherjee Nagar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_secretary_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief secretary (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preet_Vihar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preet Vihar"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Corporation_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipal Corporation of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alternating current"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormwater", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormwater"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/delhi-coaching-centre-deaths-314905249-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=ATuV8npsaqVSAGSAYdQHxR9v05RIae4t", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775565", "eventUri": "eng-9775565", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

It permits the use of basements only for storage, parking, air-conditioning plants, and other non-habitable purposes.\n\nWhy the prohibition: Basements inherently lack adequate ventilation and sufficient exit points, which can prove catastrophic in the event of a fire.\n\nWhat UT found during inspections: Several coaching institutes were using basements as reading rooms, classrooms, counselling rooms or reception offices.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chandigarh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chandigarh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratap_Singh_of_Jammu_and_Kashmir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pratap Singh of Jammu and Kashmir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administrative_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Administrative Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deputy commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Public_Sector", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Public Sector", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/30/1600x900/In-response-to-the-tragic-incident-in-Delhi--where_1722370587190.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9775565", "eventUri": "eng-9775565", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 103, "relevance": 1}

While the burgeoning coaching industry offers employment to lakhs of people, its unchecked growth has led to many mishaps that the education system can ill afford. Their unchecked growth has assumed the proportion of a menace that poses risks to the education system as well as students. The latest incident in Delhi, where three students died due to flooding of a 'study circle' located in a building's basement is only the tip of the iceberg. More troubling issues have surfaced in the not-too-distant past. Coaching centres have also been at the centre of several question paper leaks as well as other irregularities in exams as consequential as the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test. The coaching industry in India is estimated to be a Rs 50,000-60,000-crore business and is expected to touch the Rs 1.5 lakh crore mark in the next five years.\n\nAlmost all this growth has been unregulated. In January this year, the Union education ministry came up with a set of guidelines for the sector.

However, there is widespread confusion about which coaching centers are legally operating and which are not. Here's a closer look at the rules and regulations governing coaching institutes in India.\n\nNew Regulations\n\nOn January 18, 2024, the central government of India issued new regulations for coaching centers, introducing significant changes for both students and the coaching industry.\n\nCoaching centers must apply for registration with the official body in their local jurisdiction, adhering to specific documentation requirements.\n\nEach branch of a coaching center will be treated as a separate entity and will need individual registration.\n\nAge Restrictions:\n\nStudents under the age of 16 are not permitted to enroll.\n\nOnly students who have completed their secondary school examinations are eligible for admission.\n\nInfrastructure Requirements:\n\nCoaching centers must provide at least one square meter of space per student in each classroom.\n\nCompliance with fire safety codes is mandatory, requiring fire and building safety certificates.\n\nProper lighting, electrification, ventilation, CCTV cameras, medical assistance, and first aid kits are also required.\n\nFair Tuition Fees:\n\nTuition fees must be reasonable and transparent, with detailed receipts provided.\n\nA prospectus displaying course details, duration, classes, hostel facilities, exit policies, fee refund procedures, and other relevant information must be available.\n\nExit Policy and Fee Regulations:\n\nIf a student wishes to leave the course midway, the coaching center must provide a pro-rata refund within 10 days.\n\nNo fee hikes are allowed during the course duration, applicable to

registration cancellation for subsequent violations.\n\nCoaching centers must avoid misleading promises and maintain transparency.\n\nUpdating websites with information about tutors, academic

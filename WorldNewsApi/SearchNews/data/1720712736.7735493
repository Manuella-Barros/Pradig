Little Lexi-Mae Smith, from Glasgow, has been a huge fan of the global superstar all of her life but her parents like many others were unable to get tickets for any of the Edinburgh performances in advance. But luckily the seven-year-old's parents managed to get a hold of last minute tickets to the Eras Tour show and decided to keep it a secret from their daughter. Instead dad Garry Elliott and mum Karen Smith, told the youngster they could go along to the stadium on Friday to listen to the gig from outside the venue and her big sisters Summer, 15, and Chloe, 14, even did her hair and make-up before they headed off. Lexi-Mae's doting dad then captured the moment on film when she was presented with the tickets. The adorable youngster was lost for words before bursting into tears and giving her mum a big hug. A later video showed the youngster singing along at the concert to Love Story - her favourite Taylor Swift song. Wee Lexi was absolutely buzzing to see her idol in concert and told Glasgow Live: \"I was very excited, I didn\u2019t expect it at all. Taylor Swift is my favourite singer and my favourite song from the concert was Love Story. I\u2019ve been a fan for five years, since I was a baby.\" Garry added: \"Friday morning I went on a school trip with her to the Glasgow Science Centre. We\u2019d been trying to get tickets for weeks and weeks but they were so expensive. \"My fianc\u00e9e phoned me that morning saying there were tickets and I said to just take them. We paid \u00a3300 for each tickets - \u00a3600 in total.\" He said he was shocked by the popularity of the video, which has had nearly 300,000 views since he posted it. \"I take videos all the time, for instagram and TikTok and I never thought it\u2019d go the way it went,\" he said. \"My phone has been nonstop. It\u2019s not even just me, her sister and everything, they got her all ready. It was just madness. \"To see everybody commenting, it makes me feel so proud of what we did for her.\" Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "The seven-year-old's parents managed to get a hold of last minute tickets to the Eras Tour show and decided to keep it a secret from their daughter.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/adorable-moment-scots-youngster-gifted-32993121", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32993132.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-06-09-165944.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:48:35", "author": "Iona Young,Laura Ferguson", "authors": ["Iona Young", "Laura Ferguson"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.086}

Trump has remained unusually silent on the issue in public.\n\nMr. Trump, who is not shy about sharing his views, has not been entirely silent since last week's debate, giving a few radio interviews and posting a steady stream of messages and videos on his social media platform, Truth Social. But Mr. Trump has largely stayed out of the spotlight and allowed the Democratic Party to dominate the debate over Mr. Biden's political future, a sign that he is his preferred opponent.\n\nAfter months of relentless attacks on Mr. Biden, whom he accuses of being too physically and mentally weak to lead the country, the former president has been content to let media coverage of Democrats doubting their party's leader take over, according to two advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy.\n\nHis relative lack of public comment on the issue also reflects to some extent his desire to see Mr. Biden stay in the race and his confidence that he can easily beat the president in November, one of the advisers said.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College poll taken after the debate and released Wednesday suggests that some Republican voters feel the same way: 28 percent said they thought Biden should remain the Democratic nominee, up from 21 percent in a poll taken before the debate.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected the idea that the president would be replaced by the Democratic ticket.\n\n\"If you listen to the professionals who do this kind of thing, they say it's very difficult for anyone else to get into the race,\" Trump said in an interview with John Reid, a Virginia-based radio host.\n\nAnd echoing an argument that Mr. Biden's Democratic allies have long made that he is best positioned to beat the former president, Mr. Trump also argued that polls show Biden doing better than the people they are considering using to replace him.\n\nThe day after the debate, he argued at a rally in Virginia that Mr. Biden had fared better in head-to-head matches against him than Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he would have been happy to run against, or Michelle Obama, the former first lady.\n\nTwo polls released Tuesday somewhat belied that claim: A CNN poll found Harris with a two-point lead over Biden in a hypothetical race against Trump, even if he had still beaten her. And an Ipsos/Reuters poll found Obama an unlikely potential option for Democrats, given that she has repeatedly said she has no interest in beating Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, in a hypothetical race.\n\nMr. Trump appeared to take pleasure in mocking his rival in a raw video first reported by The Daily Beast on Wednesday and later shared by Mr. Trump. It's unclear who originally filmed the video or what day it was filmed. While playing golf on his New Jersey estate, Mr. Trump called Mr. Biden a broken-down old pile of shit and suggested he would quit the race, according to the video of his comments.\n\nIf Mr. Biden were to step down, Mr. Trump would lose two lines of attack that have been essential to his campaign. He has spent years attacking Mr. Biden by calling him sleepy, posting videos of his missteps, mocking his speeches and cartoonishly imitating him -- attacks he could not easily deploy against another opponent.\n\nFor months, Mr. Trump has tried to woo undecided voters by directly comparing his term to Mr. Biden's, often in misleading terms. That message would be undermined if another candidate replaced Mr. Biden on the ticket.\n\nA new opponent could open the door to new political challenges. Mr. Trump could face a younger opponent who could appeal to voters worried about the ages of both candidates and looking for new alternatives to two men who each had a chance at a White House term.\n\n\"I don't think anyone on the Trump campaign has ever said they want Biden off the table,\" said Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Trump adviser who is now an adviser to the Republican nominating convention. He added that the matchup between two candidates America knows very well and whose records are comparable is one that works enormously in our favor.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, a leading conservative group, is also exploring possible legal challenges it could pursue that would make it difficult to replace Mr. Biden on the ballot in some states if he withdraws.\n\nMike Howell, executive director of the Heritages Oversight Project, said the group is targeting key states like Georgia, Nevada and Wisconsin, where laws could make it difficult to put another Democrat on the ballot.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday, Mr. Trump's two campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, expressed confidence in Mr. Trump's ability to beat any Democrat in November. They accused the Democrats now attacking Mr. Biden of being hypocrites, saying each of them lied about Joe Biden's cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years.\n\nThere are signs that some close to Mr. Trump are preparing more seriously for the possibility, however remote, of a runoff against another Democratic candidate this fall. The Trump campaign and his Republican allies have stepped up their attacks on Ms. Harris, who has long been a target of the right.\n\nIn their statement Wednesday, Mr. Trump's campaign managers singled out his sneering co-pilot Kamala Harris, mocking her mannerisms and directly linking her to Mr. Biden's policies. During the debate, the campaign ran an ad suggesting that Mr. Biden was unfit to lead the country for a second term and warning that Ms. Harris was waiting in the wings to take over.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Make America Great Again Inc., the main super PAC supporting Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, sent out a list of attacks on Ms. Harris that essentially claimed she would be no better than Mr. Biden, particularly on immigration, an issue that Mr. Trump has made central to his campaign.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House Republican campaign committee announced a new digital ad that linked Ms. Harris to Mr. Biden's border policies. Vote Republican. Arrest Kamala, a placard at the end of the ad reads.\n\nAny good election campaign must take into account all possible eventualities, Lewandowski said. The campaign strategy is not changing, but it would be a dereliction of duty not to be prepared if Joe Biden drops out of the race.\n\nIn the video clip released at his golf club, Mr Trump is already looking past Mr Biden and seeing Ms Harris as his likely opponent.\n\nThat means we have Kamala, Mr. Trump said. I think she's going to get better. She's so bad. She's so pathetic.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, issued a warning of sorts on social media about how the 2024 race could change if Harris becomes the nominee.\n\nI believe the Trump campaign realizes that the 2024 race could very soon shift dramatically away from Biden's abilities and become a fight for the heart and soul of the country, Graham wrote on X Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAnd if that scenario plays out, Graham added, Republicans should lean on President Trump's ability to expand our party's demographic reach in 2024.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source":

Their actions say otherwise\n\nTdebate was awful for Joe Biden, but the cover-up has been worse. It was agony to watch a befuddled old man struggling to recall words and facts. His inability to land an argument against a weak opponent was dispiriting. But the operation by his campaign to deny what tens of millions of Americans saw with their own eyes is more toxic than either, because its dishonesty provokes contempt.\n\nThe effect has been to put the White House within Donald Trump's grasp. Fresh polls have found that voters in the states Mr Biden must win have moved against him. His lead may be in danger even in once-safe states such as Virginia, Minnesota and New Mexico.\n\nMr Biden deserves to be remembered for his accomplishments and his decency rather than his decline. So it is right that the first senior Democrats have begun to call openly for him to step aside. However, their public expressions are nothing compared with the building wave of private dismay. More of them urgently need to face up to the fact that if they do not speak out now, Mr Trump will win. In order to bring about the political renewal that America now so clearly needs, they must call for change. It is not too late.\n\nDemocrats argue, rightly, that Mr Trump is unfit to be president. But the debate and its aftermath have proved Mr Biden unfit, too. First, because of his mental decline. Mr Biden can still appear dynamic during short, scripted appearances. But you cannot run a superpower by autocue. And you cannot put an international crisis on hold because the president is having a bad night. Should someone who cannot finish a sentence about Medicare be trusted with the nuclear codes?\n\nMr Biden is blameless for his failing powers, but not for a second disqualification, which is his insistence, abetted by his family, senior staff and Democratic elites, that he is still up to the world's toughest job. Mr Biden's claim that this election is between right and wrong is ruined by the fact that the existence of his campaign now depends on a lie.\n\nDemocrats sneer at the Republican Party for its craven behaviour towards Mr Trump. Again, they are right. Too many Republicans have parroted his falsehoods and lacked the moral courage to speak out against his abuses. Convinced they could outlast him, or that someone else would pay the price for ejecting him, senators and congressmen have put their ambition before their country.\n\nThe Democratic Party should look in the mirror, starting with Mr Biden himself. He avers that he failed in the debate because he was tired from jetting around the world, as if his debility were evidence of his vitality. His supporters argue that those awful 90 minutes should not overshadow the past three and a half years. But what matters is whether they foreshadow the next four. Senior Democrats repeating these desperate talking points or waiting in silence for someone else to speak up first may think they are being loyal. Is that loyal to their country or their careers?\n\nDemocrats might say that their tactics are just politics. Their ugly means are justified by their honourable ends of saving American democracy from the predations of Mr Trump. That defence does America no favours. The tactic of covering up your own flaws by demonising your opponent has long marred American politics, but using the threat of Mr Trump as a \"dictator\" to offset Mr Biden's evident infirmity is a form of blackmail. As the head of state, America's president embodies the virtues of the republic. The more he is seen as a stubborn old man who leaves the real work to his courtiers, the more he will undermine Americans' faith in their system of government. Representing America abroad, Mr Biden will project decrepitude -- to the delight of China and Russia and the dismay of America's allies.\n\nThere is another option. Mr Biden should withdraw from the campaign. That way, the election might refresh the body politic. The virtue of democracy is that voters can choose their rulers, but Mr Biden and Mr Trump offer a choice between the incapable and the unspeakable. Americans deserve better.\n\nAs our new podcast \"Boom!\" explains, presidential politics is stuck in a rut. Barring Barack Obama, every president since Bill Clinton in 1992 was born in the 1940s. Mr Biden (1942) first campaigned for the presidency 37 years ago, albeit in a fumbling way. At that time Mr Trump (1946) thought about running, too. Their generation came of age during the Vietnam war. It carries around the baggage of campus protests, the greed-is-good era on Wall Street and old fights over race and feminism. Those fights are very different today, and not only because they are more often waged on TikTok.\n\nThe stagnation is a failure of the party system. Parties are supposed to be vehicles that bring together factions and interests to bid for power. They have been carjacked. First the Clintons and Bushes seized the wheel. When voters were sick of them, Mr Obama and then Mr Trump staged grassroots rebellions. In today's Democratic Party the driving seat is being hogged by Mr Biden and his people. Only if Democrats take back control and persuade him to move aside can renewal begin.\n\nThe Economist first said in 2022 that Mr Biden should not seek re-election because he was too old. Immediately after the debate we made our case more strongly. A fresh candidate would have just over ten weeks after the convention to make their pitch. Such a candidate might lose, obviously, though even then the catharsis of Mr Biden's self-sacrifice would help restore American politics.\n\nBut we believe that they would have a good chance of winning -- a better one than Mr Biden, even if the candidate was Kamala Harris, his relatively unpopular vice-president. They would be fit to govern; and they would, with the exception of Ms Harris, deprive Mr Trump of his strongest arguments against Mr Biden: the responsibility for inflation, immigration and the supposed \"witch-hunt\" that led to his prosecution. America's renewal needs to start now.

That's 90 minutes on stage. Look what I've done for the last three-and-a-half years.\"\n\nMr Biden met with a group of Democratic governors yesterday at the White House to make his case. Some told reporters afterward they were sticking by his side.\n\n\"President Joe Biden is in it to win it,\" New York Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul told reporters after the talks.\n\nMaryland Democratic Governor Wes Moore said: \"We know that we have work to do. It's going to take all of us to make it happen.\"\n\nGavin Newsom, the California governor whose name is often floated as an alternative to Mr Biden, said on X, formerly Twitter, he was \"all in\" for Mr Biden.\n\nArizona's Raul Grijalva called for Mr Biden to drop out of the race while Representative Seth Moulton from Massachusetts pointed to Mr Biden's age as a liability.\n\n\"The unfortunate reality is that the status quo will likely deliver us President Trump,\" Mr Moulton said in a statement. \"President Biden is not going to get younger.\"\n\n'I had a bad debate'\n\nAsked whether there was any reason for the American people to be concerned after his halting performance in last week's debate with Mr Trump, Mr Biden demurred.\n\n\"No, I had a bad debate,\" he said, adding that this should not erase what he has done as president for three-and-a-half years.\n\nHe recited multiple statistics on issues ranging from funding for historically Black colleges and universities to student loan relief.\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

Not a joke, he means it,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nMr Biden's already shaky standing in opinion polls against Mr Trump took a slight hit after the debate in Atlanta, but a new Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Mr Biden pulled even with Mr Trump this week, a sign the contest remains close.\n\nBoth Mr Trump and Mr Biden each had 40% support among registered voters in the two-day poll that concluded on Tuesday. A prior Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted 11 - 12 June showed Donald Trump with a marginal 2 percentage point lead, 41% to 39%.\n\nMr Biden is 81 and would be 86 when his second term ends. He is being asked by some former supporters to step aside to preserve his legacy and lessen the chances of a second Trump presidency.\n\nIf he is going to survive pressure to abandon his re-election campaign after a poor showing in his debate with Mr Trump, he needs to ace a gauntlet of events in the coming days.\n\nAs calls grow from some of his own Democrats to step aside, and support coalesces around the idea of Vice President Kamala Harris taking his place in the November election, Mr Biden needs to demonstrate stamina and mental acuity to voters and donors.\n\nMr Biden is hosting families at the annual 4 July Independence Day festivities at the White House today, he will be interviewed on ABC News tomorrow and will also travel to Wisconsin tomorrow for a campaign rally with hundreds of supporters.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr Biden and his wife Jill will speak to thousands at the National Education Association in Pennsylvania. Next week he hosts dozens of world leaders at the NATO summit in Washington, and will hold a rare solo news conference. He has also done several radio interviews.\n\nDozens of House Democrats are watching closely, prepared to ask Mr Biden to step aside if he falters in the ABC interview, a source told Reuters.\n\nIn a radio interview with WURD that aired on this morning, Mr Biden spoke about his record delivering for Black Americans as president.

But Mr. Trump has largely sat back and allowed the Democratic Party to dominate the debate over Mr. Biden's political future, in a signal of his preferred opponent.\n\nAfter months of relentlessly attacking Mr. Biden as too physically and mentally weak to lead the country, the former president has been content to let the news coverage of Democrats' doubting their party's leader take hold, according to two advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy.\n\nHis relative lack of public comments on the issue also to some extent reflects his desire for Mr. Biden to stay in the race and his confidence that he can easily beat the president in November, one of the advisers said.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after the debate and released on Wednesday suggested that some Republican voters agreed: 28 percent of them said they thought Mr. Biden should remain the Democratic nominee, an uptick from 21 percent in a poll conducted before the debate.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump publicly dismissed the idea that the president would be replaced on the Democratic ticket.\n\n\"If you listen to the professionals that do this stuff, they say it's very hard for anybody else to come into the race,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview with John Reid, a Virginia-based talk radio host.\n\nAnd in an echo of a talking point that Mr. Biden's Democratic allies have long wielded to argue that he is best positioned to beat the former president, Mr. Trump has also argued that polling showed that \"Biden does better than the people they're talking about using to replace him.\"\n\nThe day after the debate, he argued at a rally in Virginia that Mr. Biden polled better in head-to-head matchups against him than did either Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he said he would \"be very happy\" to run against, or Michelle Obama, the former first lady.\n\nTwo polls released on Tuesday somewhat deflated that claim: A CNN poll found that Ms. Harris polled two percentage points ahead of Mr. Biden in a hypothetical contest against Mr. Trump, though he still defeated her. And an Ipsos/Reuters poll found that Mrs. Obama -- a long-shot potential option for Democrats given that she has repeatedly said she has no interest in running -- beat Mr. Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, in a hypothetical matchup.\n\nMr. Trump did appear to delight in mocking his rival in a raw video first reported by The Daily Beast on Wednesday and later shared by Mr. Trump. It was not clear who originally shot the clip or what day it was filmed. As he golfed on his property in New Jersey, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Biden as \"that old broken down pile of crap\" and suggested he would quit the race, according to the video of his comments.\n\nIf Mr. Biden stepped aside, Mr. Trump would lose two lines of attack that have been central to his campaign. He has spent years attacking Mr. Biden as \"sleepy,\" posting videos of Mr. Biden's stumbles, mocking his speech and performing cartoonish imitations of him, attacks that he could not easily deploy against another opponent.\n\nAnd for the last several months, Mr. Trump has tried to appeal to undecided voters by directly comparing his time in office with Mr. Biden's, often in misleading terms. That message would be hamstrung if another candidate replaced Mr. Biden on the ticket.\n\nA new opponent could open up new political challenges. Mr. Trump could face a younger opponent who could appeal to voters worried about both candidates' ages and looking for fresh alternatives to two men who each have had a shot at a White House term.\n\n\"I don't think anybody in the Trump campaign has ever said they want Biden off the ticket,\" said Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Trump adviser who is now an adviser for the Republican Party's nominating convention. He added that the matchup of \"two candidates who America both knows very well and has a record to compare is one that favors us very, very much.\"\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, a major conservative group, has also been exploring possible legal challenges it could mount that would make it difficult to replace Mr. Biden on the ballot in some states if he withdrew.\n\nMike Howell, the executive director of Heritage's Oversight Project, said the group was eyeing key battleground states like Georgia, Nevada and Wisconsin where laws might make it difficult to put a different Democrat on the ballot.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Trump's two campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, expressed their confidence that Mr. Trump could \"beat any Democrat\" in November. They accused Democrats now turning on Mr. Biden of being hypocrites, saying that \"every one of them has lied about Joe Biden's cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years.\"\n\nThere have been signs that some people in Mr. Trump's orbit are preparing more seriously for the possibility, however distant, of a matchup against another Democratic candidate this fall. The Trump campaign and Republican allies have ramped up attacks on Ms. Harris, who has long been a target of the right.\n\nIn their statement on Wednesday, Mr. Trump's campaign managers called her \"Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris,\" both mocking her mannerisms and directly linking her to Mr. Biden's policies. During the debate, the campaign ran an ad suggesting that Mr. Biden was incapable of leading the country through a second term and warning that Ms. Harris was waiting in the wings to take over.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Make America Great Again Inc., the leading super PAC supporting Mr. Trump's presidential campaign, sent out a list of attacks on Ms. Harris that essentially argued that she would be no better than Mr. Biden, particularly on immigration, an issue Mr. Trump has made central to his campaign.\n\nOn Wednesday, the campaign committee for House Republicans announced a new digital ad that linked Ms. Harris to Mr. Biden's border policies. \"Vote Republican. Stop Kamala,\" a title card at the end of the ad reads.\n\n\"Every good campaign looks at every possible contingency,\" Mr. Lewandowski said. \"The campaign's strategy isn't shifting, but it would be a dereliction of duty to not be prepared should Joe Biden drop out of the race.\"\n\nIn the video clip at his golf club, Mr. Trump nonetheless was already looking past Mr. Biden to Ms. Harris as his likely opponent.\n\n\"That means we have Kamala,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think she's going to be better. She's so bad. She's so pathetic.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close Trump ally, issued a warning of sorts on social media about how the 2024 race might shift if Ms. Harris became the nominee.\n\n\"I believe the Trump Campaign realizes the 2024 race could very soon dramatically shift away from Biden's capabilities to a fight for the heart and soul of the country,\" Mr. Graham wrote on X on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAnd if the scenario played out, Mr. Graham added, Republicans would need to \"build on President Trump's ability to expand the demographic reach of our party in 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person",

Biden vowed to stay in the 2024 presidential race during calls with campaign staff and meetings with Democratic lawmakers and governors on Wednesday, as he sought to shake off calls for him to drop out after his shaky debate performance last week.\n\nMr. Biden dialed in to a call with worried members of his campaign team and told them he wasn't going anywhere, according to two sources familiar with the call.\n\n\"No one is pushing me out. I'm not leaving. I'm in this race to the end,\" Mr. Biden said in a separate email blast by his campaign, urging supporters to \"pitch in a few bucks\" to help defeat his Republican rival Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 presidential election.\n\nThe president met virtually and in person with 24 Democratic governors and the mayor of Washington, D.C., on Wednesday evening to reassure them he is up to the job of standard-bearer for the party after the faltering debate performance.\n\nOnly three of the governors -- the leaders of New York, Minnesota and Maryland -- met with reporters afterwards, vowing to stand with Mr. Biden after what they called an honest discussion about his bad performance in last week's debate.\n\n\"The president has always had our backs. We're going to have his back as well,\" Maryland Governor Wes Moore said.\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz, the chair of the Democratic Governors Association, said Biden's Thursday night debate performance against former President Trump was bad, but added that he felt Mr. Biden was fit for office.\n\nConcerns about Mr. Biden's age and mental acuity exploded after Thursday's debate with Mr. Trump, in which the president mumbled under his breath, lost his train of thought at times and, at one point, talked of beating Medicare. The president has said that he was tired after two foreign trips and the White House has said he had a cold.\n\nAsked Wednesday if Mr. Biden was considering stepping down, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nSoon after she spoke, two national polls suggested Mr. Biden's chances against Mr. Trump -- who rattled off a series of well-worn falsehoods during the debate -- had deteriorated.\n\nA Wall Street Journal survey found Mr. Trump beating Mr. Biden by a margin of 48% to 42%, up one percentage point, while a New York Times/Siena poll found Mr. Trump's lead over Mr. Biden had widened by three points to 49% to 43%.\n\nIn a call among House Democrats on Wednesday, Arizona's Ra\u00fal Grijalva called for Mr. Biden to drop out of the race while Representative Seth Moulton from Massachusetts pointed to Mr. Biden's age as a liability.\n\n\"The unfortunate reality is that the status quo will likely deliver us President Trump,\" Seth Moulton said in a statement. \"President Biden is not going to get younger.\"\n\nWhile the campaign has highlighted fundraising successes with grassroots donors and held damage control calls with donors, Reed Hastings, a major Democratic Party donor and a co-founder of streaming platform Netflix called for Mr. Biden to step aside.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has meanwhile gained support as his potential replacement.\n\nDmitri Mehlhorn, an adviser to LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic megadonor Reid Hoffman, told Reuters his team would \"enthusiastically support a ticket led by our tough and savvy vice president if Biden were to step aside for any reason.\"\n\nMr. Melhorn said Ms. Harris was the only serious national contender who had already been subjected to major attacks by Mr. Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" supporters.\n\n\"We would lose Joe's superpower brand, but we would gain other benefits and would still be competitive,\" he said.\n\nGOVERNORS AS ALTERNATIVES?\n\nDemocrats and donors concerned about Biden's viability in the November election will be closely watching an interview with ABC News expected to be taped and aired Friday during a campaign visit to Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nThe White House said Mr. Biden has spoken with Democratic leaders in Congress as well as Democratic Representative Jim Clyburn, who was instrumental in Mr. Biden's 2020 win.\n\nMr. Clyburn, who has said he would back Ms. Harris as the presidential candidate if Mr. Biden stepped aside, told CNN on Wednesday that the party should hold a \"mini-primary\" if Mr. Biden steps aside, the first senior party member to talk publicly about how replacing Mr. Biden as a candidate could work.\n\nSome of the governors who met with Mr. Biden on Wednesday could be potential rivals if pressure for him to step aside were to increase, but many of them also speak on Mr. Biden's behalf on the campaign trail.\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear have all been mentioned as possible replacements to Mr. Biden. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessWorld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Moulton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seth Moulton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra\u00fal_Grijalva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ra\u00fal Grijalva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Governors_Association", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Governors Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Maryland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Maryland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Democrats will be quick to point out that his election rival Mr Trump is no spring chicken at 78.\n\n\"I didn't have my best night, but the fact is that you know, I wasn't very smart,\" Mr Biden said.\n\nHe added that he had debated following several flights through various time zones, causing jet lag.\n\nBut his comments are unlikely to dampen fevered speculation about his future.\n\nSo what are people saying about this and who could replace him if he does leave the US presidential race?\n\n\"[This was] to demonstrate to the American people, particularly those living in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona, that he is not too old to be president.\n\n\"He couldn't do it,\" he said.\n\nAfter his head-to-head with Mr Trump, CNN asked viewers who had won -- and 67 per cent said it was the Republican nominee, while 33 per cent backed the incumbent Democrat.\n\nAt one point, Mr Biden's voice trailed when speaking about Trump's economic record. He finished his remarks by making the seemingly irrelevant comment: \"We finally beat Medicare.\"\n\nThe performance was so alarming that US polls are now in favour of Mr Trump despite the former president's criminal conviction.\n\nLatest polling suggests that voters feel Mr Biden is too old and should not run. Even 51 per cent of Democrat voters said a new candidate should be found.\n\nMr Biden is already the oldest ever president, having taken the record from Ronald Reagan -- who lasted until age 77. Mr Trump is already third on the list and, would claim the unwanted title if he becomes president again.\n\nAs AP reported of Mr Biden: \"He is often sharp and focused. But he also has moments, particularly later in the evening, when his thoughts seem jumbled and he trails off mid-sentence or seems confused. Sometimes he doesn't grasp the finer points of policy details. He occasionally forgets people's names, stares blankly and moves slowly around the room.\"\n\nWhile such moments are common for someone his age, it is not a good look for a man attempting to become the most powerful in the world.\n\nMr Biden has insisted he will not step down.\n\n\"We understand the concerns. We get it,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week. But she emphasised Mr Biden has no intention of stepping away from the campaign. \"The president is clear-eyed and he is staying in the race.\"\n\nMr Biden's doctor Dr Kevin O'Connor said in February that the president was \"fit for duty\".\n\nDr O'Connor said Mr Biden was adjusting well to a new device that helps control his sleep apnoea. He said he had experienced some hip discomfort but also works out five times per week.\n\nHowever, Mr Trump is confident he has the upper hand on his embattled rival.\n\n\"I kicked that old broken-down piece of crap,\" the former president boasted on July 3.\n\nHe then made an unsubstantiated claim, while out on a golf course, that Mr Biden had \"quit the race\" and that the Democrats would instead put forward Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"I think she's gonna be better,\" he said. \"She's so bad. She's pathetic. She's so fxxxxxx bad.\"\n\nFor clarification, any names are purely speculative given Mr Biden's apparent desire to stay in the job.\n\nThe Democratic Party will officially choose him as its presidential candidate at its convention on August 19, all being well.\n\nIf Mr Biden stands down voluntarily before then, it would spark a snap party contest to replace him.\n\nIt would be unprecedented for the Democrats to force someone out. There are limited powers to do this now that he has won the backing in a party vote.\n\nHowever, here are some of the frontrunners in a hypothetical leadership contest:\n\nMs Harris would take over as president should her boss quit -- but that would not mean she would be automatically in the frame to fight for the election.\n\nHer experience might make her an obvious candidate but her poll ratings count against her.\n\nThe governor of California is coming to the end of his second, and final, term in office and is said to be eyeing up the top job.\n\nHowever, the 57-year-old has also performed poorly in polls and projections say he would lose a run-off against Mr Trump.\n\nThe former first lady has a large personal brand and big-name recognition but has limited political experience.\n\nShe has steered clear of backing Mr Biden in the election run-up over an alleged feud about how the president's family handled Hunter Biden's split with her friend Kathleen Buhle.\n\nGretchen Whitmer is a rising star in the party and governor of Michigan while Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor, is also reportedly in the frame.\n\nBeto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, was once touted as a future president but has lost his last three election votes.\n\nLong shots include Robert Kennedy Jr, Hillary Clinton, and Dwayne Johnson.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

The special counsel, they countered, was a registered Republican.\n\nWhen The Wall Street Journal last month published a long article that documented a series of behind-closed-doors meetings in which participants said Mr. Biden often stumbled over his words, got names and facts wrong or appeared to tune out, the blowback from the White House was brutal and dismissive.\n\nDemocrats accused the Journal of propagating a false Republican narrative about the 81-year-old Mr. Biden and not paying the same amount of attention to the age (78) and mental acuity of presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump. But we now know that the Democrats were either in denial or complicit in a deceitful cover-up.\n\nThe lid has now been blown off this scandal. Could the timing be any worse, with only four months to go until the election and with Mr. Trump riding a wave of good news? A Supreme Court decision this week on presidential immunity could deal a fatal blow to special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of the former president for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nMr. Biden's terrifyingly wobbly debate performance was agonizing to watch. It laid bare for the entire planet what most of Washington has been whispering about for months - that the world's most powerful man is a shadow of his former self, struggling to string his sentences together and sounding at times as incoherent as Grampa Simpson.\n\nIn the aftermath of the debate, the White House has nevertheless tried to pass off his performance as a one-off. As the disaster was unfolding in real-time, Democratic aides said that Mr. Biden had a cold. Later, they tried to spin the narrative that he was simply worn down by a punishing travel schedule that had taken him to Europe twice in the past month, first to join in D-Day commemorations in France, then to the G7 summit in Italy. Neither of those excuses flew.\n\n\"Telling people they didn't see what they saw is not the way to respond to this,\" Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser under Barack Obama, wrote on X on debate night.\n\nThe next day, The New York Times, which just a week earlier had published an article defending Mr. Biden against \"misleading\" Republican videos that claimed to depict Mr. Biden's apparent mental lapses during his recent European trips, came out with a scathing editorial calling on Mr. Biden to step down in favour of a new Democratic nominee to take on Mr. Trump.\n\n\"As it stands, the President is engaged in a reckless gamble,\" the Times editorial board said. \"It's too big of a bet to simply hope Americans will overlook or discount Mr. Biden's age and infirmity that they see with their own eyes.\"\n\nEven after this, the Biden campaign sent out a fundraising email on the weekend that claimed the media had ignored the President's bouncy post-debate appearances because they were \"busy hyperventilating and trying to manifest drama to boost ratings.\"\n\nWell, anyone who cares about democracy and the future of the free world should be hyperventilating right now. The prospect of a Trump \"revenge\" presidency, facilitated by the Supreme Court's removal of limits on executive power, is very real. And Democrats are still debating whether they should push Mr. Biden out the door before it is too late.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Times reported that Mr. Biden has privately acknowledged that he may not be able to salvage his candidacy. \"Absolutely false,\" the White House riposted.\n\nMr. Biden has been underestimated so many times in his five-decade-long political career that it may be tempting for his staunchest supporters to think this time is no different. But it is. Democrats have six weeks to organize an open convention before they meet in late August to officially choose their party's presidential nominee. The circumstances are less than ideal and there is no clear alternative to Mr. Biden who has the name recognition, favourability rating and experience to avoid what might be a nasty nomination race.\n\nDemocrats have no one to blame but themselves for this mess. Most of them have long known that Mr. Biden was tempting fate by seeking a second term. That might not have mattered if only his career was on the line. We all know that is not the case.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Just as we beat Donald Trump in 2020, we're going to beat him again in 2024,\" he said, according to a source close to the campaign.\n\nHe repeated that message in an emergency meeting with Democratic governors, who pledged their continued support, attendees said afterward.\n\n\"As the President continued to tell us, and show us, that he was all in... we said that we would stand with him,\" Maryland Governor Wes Moore, seen as a rising star and potential future presidential candidate, told reporters alongside Minnesota's Tim Walz and Kathy Hochul of New York.\n\nMr. Walz said Mr. Biden was \"fit to serve.\"\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who also attended the meeting at the White House and is seen as one of the top picks to replace Mr. Biden if he should drop out, said on social media platform X that \"he is in it to win it and I support him.\"\n\nMr. Biden has admitted he performed poorly in the debate, and was blunt in a radio interview recorded Wednesday with Wisconsin's Civic Media.\n\n\"I screwed up. I made a mistake. That's 90 minutes on stage. Look at what I've done in 3.5 years,\" he said.\n\nHe echoed that sentiment in an interview with Pennsylvania's WURD radio on Thursday, saying \"I had a bad debate.\"\n\nAftermath\n\nThe Biden campaign has been desperate to reassure Democratic donors and voters that the president's performance against Trump was a one-off.\n\nBut party figures have voiced bafflement over what they see as deflection and excuses from the President and his aides.\n\nNetflix co-founder Reed Hastings, one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors, told the New York Times that Biden should withdraw.\n\n\"Mr. Biden needs to step aside to allow a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Mr. Trump and keep us safe and prosperous,\" he said in an email to the paper.\n\nThe concern was compounded by a New York Times poll conducted after the debate that showed Trump with his biggest lead ever over Mr. Biden -- 49% to 43% of likely voters.\n\nIt wasn't until Wednesday -- six days after the debate -- that Mr. Biden completed a round of calls with Democratic congressional leaders, and staffers have also voiced consternation over the glacial pace of the outreach.\n\n\"We are getting to the point where it may not have been the debate that did him in, but the aftermath of how they've handled it,\" a senior Democratic operative told Washington political outlet Axios.\n\nMr. Biden may be tested on his ability to think on his feet when he sits with ABC News on Friday for his first television interview since the debate, and he will also hit the swing states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in the coming days.\n\n'More worrisome'\n\nThe President has cited fatigue as a new explanation for his poor debate showing, saying that he was unwise to travel \"around the world a couple times\" before the debate.\n\nBut he had been back in the United States for nearly two weeks and spent two days relaxing and six days preparing before the debate.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have begun to go public with their doubts. Arizona congressman Raul Grijalva became the second sitting Democrat to call on Mr. Biden to drop out.\n\n\"If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere,\" Grijalva said, according to the Times.\n\nIn the street where the president grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, there was sympathy for Mr. Biden -- but no campaign signs for either candidate.\n\n\"I was embarrassed for him. I felt he didn't feel well and he probably shouldn't have gone on the stage,\" said 73-year-old Jamie Hayes.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

His current state is a far cry from footage of him jogging around the White House with Barack Obama a decade ago.\n\nAccording to the Axios website, Mr Biden is sharpest between 10am and 4pm, but outside those hours he is prone to fatigue and verbal gaffes.\n\nEven though age is no bar to holding political office in the US - Strom Thurmond was a Senator at the age of 100 - voters will be asking if Mr Biden is physically and mentally fit enough to serve as president for another four years.\n\nSo how healthy is Mr Biden?\n\nWhen Mr Biden moved into the White House, he wanted to bring his Peloton bike with him, but the Secret Service objected.\n\nNevertheless, the president has cycled along bike pathways near his beach house in Rehoboth Beach. But two years ago a photo-op did not go well when he fell off after his foot caught in one of the pedals.\n\nAccording to Kevin O'Connor, his physician, Mr Biden exercises five times a week, although his current exercise routine is unclear. When he went to Lake Tahoe on holiday last year, he and his wife Jill took pilates and spin classes.\n\nDuring the presidential debate, Mr Biden and Trump squabbled about their respective abilities on the golf course.\n\nThe former president challenged his successor to a golf match, having claimed Mr Biden could not hit a ball 50 yards.\n\nMr Biden retorted that he brought his handicap down to six while he was vice president and challenged Trump to a golf game - provided he carried his own clubs.\n\nMr Biden is teetotal and a non-smoker.\n\nAccording to Axios, Mr Biden prefers carbs over greens, much to the chagrin of his wife Jill, who has been urging him to increase the amount of fish and vegetables in his diet.\n\nHe appears to have a sweet tooth, enjoying peanut butter and jam sandwiches, biscuits and ice cream sundaes.\n\nOther presidential favourites are bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches, and pizza.\n\nEschewing alcohol, his drink of choice is orange Gatorade.\n\nWhile Trump was an avid watcher of television, his channel of choice was Fox News. Mr Biden's consumption is more limited, normally keeping up with the news on CNN or MSNBC while working out in the morning.\n\nDr O'Connor concluded in February that the president was a \"healthy, active, robust 81-year old male. Who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.\"\n\nBut at the same time, his detailed report did flag up some health issues. One was Obstructive Sleep Apnea, a condition which affects over 30 million Americans. It requires him to wear a mask at night to improve the flow of oxygen into his brain.\n\nHe does suffer from gastric reflux, which requires him to clear his throat more frequently.\n\nThe most noticeable problem is his gait. He appears stiff while walking, largely as a result of wear and tear as well as arthritis, especially on his left hip.\n\nDr O'Connor carried out a detailed neurological examination in February and found no evidence which would suggest a major disorder such as stroke, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease.\n\nBut his assessment has been challenged. In particular by Robert Hur, a special prosecutor investigating whether action should be taken against Mr Biden over his handling of classified documents.\n\nMr Hur's report, which was angrily disputed by the president, described Mr Biden's memory as \"hazy\", \"fuzzy\" and \"faulty\".\n\nRonny Jackson, who was Trump's physician and is now a Republican congressman, has claimed that Mr Biden's \"mental decline\" has accelerated.\n\nHowever, critics have questioned his assessment, given his own controversial record in the White House, where he was allegedly dishing out sedatives and stimulants without a prescription.\n\nNevertheless, even those more sympathetic to Mr Biden have commented on his mental acuity.\n\nCarl Bernstein, one of the most respected journalists in the US, said Mr Biden had more than a dozen \"senior moments\" over the past 18 months, adding that senior Democrats had privately voiced concern over increasing spells of \"cognitive decline and physical infirmity\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Day_O'Connor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandra Day O'Connor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strom Thurmond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandwich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboth_Beach,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teetotalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatorade", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gatorade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake Tahoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peanut butter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tomato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pizza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pilates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettuce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lettuce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

Other names have also been floated.\n\nIf Biden does step down, here are some the people who might replace him.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who is already on the ticket, is an obvious and increasingly popular choice to replace Mr Biden.\n\nAs vice president, she has become the face of the administration's campaign to protect reproductive rights after the Supreme Court's overturned Roe v Wade.\n\nMs Harris has proved to be a loyal ally to the president and fiercely defended his debate performance. After the event, she admitted the president had a \"slow start\" but argued he went on to provide more substantive answers than Trump.\n\nDays after the debate, as concern grew about the president's ability to stay atop the ticket, Ms Harris reiterated her support for Mr Biden.\n\n\"Look, Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we're going to beat him again, period,\" she said Tuesday.\n\n\"I am proud to be Joe Biden's running mate.\"\n\nMs Harris has the strong name recognition that comes from the job of vice president, but she has struggled with low approval ratings throughout her tenure.\n\nForty-nine percent of Americans disapprove of Ms Harris, while 39% approve, according to polling averages tracked by FiveThirtyEight.\n\nMs Harris will also have a prime-time moment that could vault her ahead of the pack of potential presidential contenders when she faces off against Trump's pick for vice president. The BBC's US media partner CBS is scheduled to host a vice presidential debate before the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nGretchen Whitmer, the two term governor of Michigan, is an increasingly popular mid-west Democrat who many pundits speculate will run for president in 2028.\n\nShe has campaigned for Mr Biden in the past and has not been shy about her political aspirations.\n\nShe told the New York Times she wants to see a Generation X president in 2028, but stopped short of suggesting that she might fill that role.\n\nIn 2022, she led a campaign that left Michigan Democrats in control of the state's legislature and the governor's mansion.\n\nThat political control allowed her to enact a number of progressive policies including protecting Michigan abortion access and the passage of gun safety measures.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is one of the Biden Administration's fiercest surrogates. He frequently appears on cable news networks praising Mr Biden.\n\nBut Mr Newsom has political ambitions of his own.\n\nHe is often listed as a possible 2028 candidate, but many Democratic pundits have said he would be an appealing stand-in for Mr Biden.\n\nMr Newsom raised his national profile in recent years by being a key party messenger on conservative media, and via a debate against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last year.\n\nIt is no secret that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has presidential aspirations.\n\nHe ran for president in 2020 and is often touted as one of the Biden Administration's best communicators.\n\nMr Buttigieg has managed a number of public crises during his time as Transportation Secretary.\n\nHe helped to oversee the government response to the East Palestine train derailment, the Baltimore Bridge collapse and Southwest Airlines' scheduling crisis in 2022.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has seen high approval ratings since he was elected in 2022 in a swing state Mr Trump narrowly carried in 2016.\n\nThe governor, who previously served as the state's attorney general, has worked across party lines during his tenure.\n\nHe made national headlines last year after quickly rebuilding a collapsed bridge on a crucial Philadelphia highway - a major political victory for a first-term governor.\n\nThe quick repair was hailed by many as the perfect infrastructure talking point for a potential 2028 presidential candidate.\n\nJB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has raised his profile in recent years by going after Trump and defending Mr Biden.\n\nThe billionaire businessman - heir to the Hyatt hotel chain - is quick to post criticism of Trump on social media.\n\nAfter the debate he called Trump a \"liar\" and said he is a \"34-count convicted felon who cares only about himself\".\n\nLike Ms Whitmer, Mr Pritzker has a track record of completing agenda items on progressive Democrats to-do lists on issues like abortion rights and gun control.\n\nThe list of potential nominees stretches beyond these Democrats, as the party has developed a deep bench of possible future presidential candidates.\n\nKentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a two-term Democratic governor in a very conservative state, has earned growing national attention since his re-election last year.\n\nMaryland Governor Wes Moore has found himself in the spotlight in recent months following the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.\n\nSenators Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker are often mentioned, as they have run for president in the past and have some name recognition among Democrats.\n\nGeorgia Senator Raphael Warnock, who won a closely contested senate race in a swing-state, has also been mentioned as a potential replacement for Mr Biden.\n\nA Reuters IPSOS poll released Tuesday found the only person who could beat Trump in November was Michelle Obama.

He is severely diminished. The Hur report - from Mr. Biden's own Justice Department - confirmed that.\n\nPeople who know him, who work with him, know this and fail to do the right thing.\n\nJill Biden, the president's wife, is the No. 1 elder-abuse culprit in the Great Biden Hoax. That's followed by Kamala Harris, Barack Obama, Susan Rice, Hillary Clinton, Ron Klain, Gen. Lloyd Austin, Xavier Becerra, Jennifer Granholm, Alejandro Mayorkas, Marcia Fudge, Deb Haaland, Merrick Garland, Antony Blinken, Pete Buttigieg, Janet Yellen, John Kerry, Samantha Power and anyone with close contact with the president.\n\nThe newest CBS poll out after the debate shows more voters think Mr. Biden does not have the cognitive health to be president. It was 65% before the debate, now it's 72%. Jeeyzus, ladies and gentlemen, 72% of voters say Mr. Biden doesn't have the cognitive health to be president? What have we become as a nation?\n\nThis, I assure you, scares the pants off of down-ticket Democrats in Nevada and elsewhere. Biden was already a liability for the vulnerable first-term incumbent Sen. Jacky Rosen. Now the Biden campaign is sending substitutes to Nevada. Recently they sent New York Congresscritter Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Las Vegas to - what? - remind us how evil Jews and Israel are in committing genocide in Gaza. I'm sure that did a lot of good for Sen. Rosen, who is Jewish.\n\nThe AP reports this week that the top ranks of the Democratic Party are none too happy with the Biden campaign, saying the campaign continues to downplay how devastating the debate was for Mr. Biden.\n\nIn a call with the Democratic National Committee last week, members of the committee who were granted anonymity by the AP \"described feeling like they were being gaslighted -- that they were being asked to ignore the dire nature of the party's predicament.\"\n\nWe'll get some good post-debate polling by the time you read this. If the numbers don't change much, maybe the party sticks with their \"Weekend At Bernie's\" candidate. But, remember, Mr. Biden is already slightly behind in the polls. In Nevada he's a lot more than slightly down. If he slips further, the Party will have to switch him out or face - as former President Obama once called it - a \"schellacking\" in November.\n\nThat's how I'm seeing it. Am I going wrong?\n\nI believe they can switch, even though the primaries have been held, and still get the new name on the ballot. Republicans in Nevada would likely challenge the move, but the folks I read say they'd lose the challenge. Still, that's an interesting question.\n\nI must add one thing this week. During the debate, Mr. Biden claimed to be a 6 handicap golfer. It's not impossible that a person of his age can score well enough to support a 6 handicap. I know a lot of older golfers, teeing off from the proper tee boxes, who can still stripe it down the middle, hit greens in regulation and two putt with ease.\n\nBut, I am compelled as your faithful Nevada journalist sworn to tell the truth, there is no way on gawd's green earth Mr. Biden is a 6 handicap golfer. We've all seen him \"old-man\" steps and struggle mightily to simply get out of a chair. I doubt he could tee-up a ball by himself, much less shoot in the 70s.\n\nDonald Trump called him on it and said he doubted Joe Biden could hit the ball 50 yards, which I bring up only to tell you that I once saw Mr. Trump on the driving range at Southern Highlands in Las Vegas.\n\nHe can play, as I remember. But, the one thing that stuck in my mind about that day is how the gusty Vegas winds blew off his hat and caught his comb-over hair as I shook his hand.\n\nI tried not to look, but I couldn't.

Decades later, Mr. Trump is leaning into bloodsports and other games as he faces the fight of his life: A campaign to return to the White House.\n\nMr. Trump is close with Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White and a fixture at primetime fights. New York Giants legend Lawrence Taylor showed up at a Trump rally in May and, the following month, the ex-president congratulated the University of Tennessee and its coach for their victory over a \"GREAT\" Texas A&M team in the College World Series.\n\nHe's also hosted Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournaments at his Bedminster resort.\n\nThe forays into sports are \"a crystal-clear reminder that sports can be politics by other means,\" said Jules Boykoff, a politics professor at Pacific University in Oregon. \"Trump is following a long line of U.S. presidents who have tried to use sports as a trampoline for their popularity. Think of Barack Obama and his very public NCAA March Madness bracket predictions or George W. Bush and his love of baseball, not to mention his ownership of a baseball team.\"\n\nMr. Trump is in a virtual dead heat with Mr. Biden heading into November's contest, so both men are looking for an edge with young people and other voting blocs. One in five persons aged 18 to 34 reported in May 2023 that they were avid fans of combat sports such as UFC, according to Statista.\n\nMr. Biden carried the youth vote by 25 percentage points over Mr. Trump in 2020, but a spate of polls released earlier this year warned that in 2024, Mr. Trump could flip the script.\n\nYoung voters in the polls cited several areas in which they say Mr. Biden has disappointed them. Efforts to cancel student loans or codify Roe v. Wade have run into roadblocks and some young people believe Mr. Biden mishandled the economy.\n\nWorries about the president's age and vigor loom above it all, particularly after Mr. Biden's debate performance in Atlanta.\n\n\"By relating to sports, politicians want to show that they are fit, not only physically but also for the challenges that await them,\" said Danyel Reiche, a political scientist at Georgetown University who studies the intersection of sports and politics. \"Being a guest at sporting events such as UFC fights is also a way to show that they are not an isolated elite but close to the people.\"\n\nMr. Biden hasn't leaned on sports to the same extent as Mr. Trump but he has some prominent players on his team. Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr endorsed Mr. Biden in June, pointing to the Democrat's push to combat gun violence.\n\n\"It's really a very simple choice for me,\" Mr. Kerr said.\n\nMr. Biden last year tapped a star-studded roster of Warriors star Stephen Curry, former Philadelphia Phillies star Ryan Howard and Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim for his Presidential Fitness Council, and the president used the Super Bowl to launch his campaign's TikTok account.\n\nMr. Trump's love of sports, meanwhile, has a long backstory. He sparred with the NFL in the 1980s as owner of the New Jersey Generals in the rival United States Football League (USFL) and later flirted with buying the Buffalo Bills.\n\nSome experts say his current obsession is an extension of his affinity for celebrity culture.\n\n\"It might be an attempt to connect with young people, but I think it is a species of his obsession with celebrity and with being 'strong' and 'tough,'\" said Lawrence B. Glickman, a professor at Cornell University who studies the intersection of politics and sports. \"Don't forget that he also has gotten into spats with popular athletes like LeBron James and Steph Curry. He called Colin Kaepernick a 'son of a bitch.' Some teams and athletes have refused to meet him in the White House.\"\n\n\"So it's not like his views about sports always make him popular,\" he said. \"For every Tony Romo, who goes golfing with him, there are other popular athletes who have been publicly critical of him.\"\n\nDavid Niven, a political science professor at the University of Cincinnati, said because a segment of the sports world is closed off to Mr. Trump, he chooses guys athletes like Mr. Taylor -- a fierce 1980s linebacker -- to contrast himself with Mr. Biden.\n\n\"Sports figures, at least the kind of sports figures willing to stand beside Trump, have qualities Trump wants to project on himself: strength, prominence, and outlaw status,\" said Mr. Niven, who teaches a class on sports and politics. \"The bigger purpose of trotting out sports figures is just to keep the circus going. Trump needs people he thinks are interesting to stand beside him and help keep him interesting.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign said sports are an important part of American culture and can unify people of different backgrounds.\n\n\"President Trump has always been an avid sports fan and has many close friends who are some of the best athletes in the world. President Trump is also known to be a great athlete himself, recently winning two club championships against some very fine golfers. Joe Biden could never,\" Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nDuring his presidency, Mr. Trump soaked in the crowd at college football events across the South and made headlines by feting college champions with a large spread of fast-food delights at the White House.\n\nMr. Trump is reprising his role as fan-in-chief as he confronts a series of legal woes and a third presidential campaign.\n\nThe former president received a loud ovation from fans at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, in one of his first big appearances following a guilty verdict for falsifying business records in Manhattan. Dressed in a navy suit and red tie, he raised a fist to greet UFC fans seated behind him.\n\nDays later, Mr. Trump appeared on a podcast hosted by Logan Paul, a YouTuber and professional wrestler. A teaser for the episode showed Mr. Paul and Mr. Trump staring each other down like prize fighters before breaking into laughter.\n\nMr. Paul asked Mr. Trump if his younger brother, Jake Paul, would beat Mike Tyson in an upcoming fight. The former president, settling into his comfort zone, gave an answer that hearkened to his 1980s heyday while acknowledging the current landscape.\n\n\"Mike was fantastic. But Mike's a little older now,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And you guys can fight.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Spinks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Spinks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A&M_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas A&M University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Tennessee"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Selection", "body": "The former president's reluctance to name a running mate has, in recent days, been partly to avoid shifting the focus away from President Biden amid fallout from the debate.\n\nUncertainty over whether President Biden will continue seeking re-election, despite his pledges to stay in the race, has sharpened the focus on Donald J. Trump's political calculations for choosing his Republican running mate.\n\nSome people close to the former president said privately they now want him to give more consideration to a young contender or to a person of color, a move that could counter the possibility that someone like Kamala Harris, the first woman and first woman of color to serve as vice president, could replace Mr. Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nSuch a scenario could help at least a couple of Mr. Trump's top contenders: Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, who is the second-youngest member of the Senate, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, whose Cuban American heritage is central to his political biography.\n\nBut among those in Mr. Trump's circle who believe that Mr. Biden's disastrous debate performance makes a Republican victory more likely in November, there's another train of thought: that Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota is now a stronger option. Mr. Burgum, also one of Mr. Trump's top contenders, has executive experience from two terms in that office and a long career as a business executive.\n\nEither way, the countdown to Mr. Trump's announcement has begun. His campaign has already parked an airplane dedicated to the Republican vice-presidential nominee in an undisclosed hangar, awaiting Mr. Trump's decision, according to one person familiar with the planning.\n\nThere is also increasing anticipation for Mr. Trump's next two rallies.\n\nOne is planned on Tuesday at Mr. Trump's property in Doral, Fla., in Mr. Rubio's home county, Miami-Dade. Mr. Trump has been urging his team for nearly two years to hold a rally at the Doral property, where, as president, he pushed to host the Group of 7 summit until criticism from fellow Republicans convinced him to hold it elsewhere. Another rally is scheduled next Saturday, July 13, in Butler, Pa., not far from the border with Mr. Vance's home state of Ohio.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cuban Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Trump.\n\nMr. Biden told the governors, 10 of whom were at the White House and 13 more who participated virtually, according to the White House, that he was staying in the race.\n\nHe described his extensive foreign travel in the weeks before the debate, something that the White House and his allies have in recent days cited as the reason for his halting performance during the debate. Initially, Mr. Biden's campaign blamed a cold, putting out word about midway through the debate amid a series of social media posts questioning why Mr. Biden was struggling.\n\nMr. Biden said that he told his staff he needed to get more sleep, multiple people familiar with what took place in the meeting said. He repeatedly referenced pushing too hard and not listening to his team about his schedule, and said he needed to work fewer hours and avoid events after 8 p.m., according to one of the people familiar with what took place at the meeting.\n\nAfter Gov.

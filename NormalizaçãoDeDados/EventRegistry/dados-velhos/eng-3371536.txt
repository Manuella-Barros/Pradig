D. Daniels: Following his lead", "uri": "711008509", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-17T16:58:00Z", "time": "16:58:00", "body": "\u00d7 Expand\n\nPhotos by Todd Lester.\n\nDaniels runs down a Shades Valley ball carrier in October.\n\nTwo activities consume the majority of C.D. Daniels' thoughts: watching film and making plays.\n\nHis devotion to one has enabled him to excel at the other.\n\nDaniels, a 6-foot-3 senior cornerback at Homewood High School, has hawked 11 interceptions over the course of his two-year varsity career, just seven short of the Patriots' all-time record. A University of Memphis commit, he enters the fall as one of the area's top players, and a Homewood squad with playoff aspirations will be counting on him.\n\n\"C.D. is our team leader, our team captain,\" Patriots head coach Ben Berguson said. \"He's everything, and our whole team kind of rallies around him.\"\n\nC.D. is short for CarDamien, Daniels' first name that has long been traded for its more efficient abbreviation. The attention-grabbing initials match his athletic personality.\n\nDaniels plays with charisma and swagger, and he's not afraid to turn up the volume. He's the hype man in the pre-game tunnel. On the field, he'll chirp.\n\n\"If I'm trying to get in somebody's head, I'm going to talk,\" said Daniels, grinning through red braces one summer morning. \"I'm going to have a little fun with it, get my teammates excited.\"\n\nBut his play backs up his provocation, and he has a steady diet of film to thank. Daniels spends time each day -- both in and out of season -- studying game footage.\n\nRoutinely, he alternates between dissecting the tendencies of his opponents and analyzing the movements of players he admires. One defensive back he views frequently is Vernon Hargreaves III, the cornerback for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers who starred at the University of Florida.\n\nDaniels identifies with the former Gator, who recorded 10 picks during his time in Gainesville.\n\n\"He makes plays just like me,\" Daniels said. \"I try to be around the ball all the time.\"\n\nCollege coaches haven't been able to resist Daniels' own tape. Before committing to Memphis in July, he had fielded 13 offers from schools across the Southeast.\n\nThe extensive list was scrawled across a whiteboard in Berguson's office, and it included the likes of UAB, Tulane and Mississippi State.\n\nThe flurry of college interest didn't surprise Berguson, who saw Daniels' potential from the time he stepped on the field two seasons ago. In his first varsity start, he recorded a pick-six to key a win over Decatur.\n\nC.D. scored a TD.\n\n\"He was phenomenal as a sophomore, and we knew we had a big-time player on our hands,\" Berguson said. \"He's long and rangy and can run. He's just gifted.\"\n\nMany traits set Daniels apart, but his aforementioned length is one of the most conspicuous. There are few corners of equal size -- and even fewer with equal ability. Daniels, who transitioned from safety to corner last season, can control his hips in coverage and blanket opposing wide receivers.\n\nWhen he recognizes a route, he pounces.\n\n\"Basically, I see what's going to happen,\" Daniels said, \"like my instincts just take over and I make a play.\"\n\nThe corner intercepted seven passes last fall, up three from his sophomore year, and will almost certainly add to that total this season. But his impact won't be limited to one side of the ball.\n\nDaniels also will serve as a return man on special teams and, at times, line up at wide receiver. \"He's just so athletic,\" Berguson said. \"He's like a gazelle once he gets the ball.\"\n\nDaniels' overall growth as a player has correlated to his growth as a leader. Jaden Alexander, a Homewood junior cornerback, noticed the transformation begin last season when Daniels filled a leadership vacuum created by a lack of returning depth in the secondary.\n\nOpportunity beckoned. Daniels answered.\n\n\"He's just like a dynamic player with tremendous playmaking ability,\" Alexander said. \"You can follow his lead.\"\n\nDaniels is aware of his position in the locker room, and he said he tries to set an example through his actions and words. If one of his teammates is down, he'll pick them up. Similarly, a smart play by a fellow Patriot elicits a slap on the pads and a token of verbal encouragement from their vocal teammate.\n\nDaniels' performance has given him this platform. His play has spoken for itself.\n\n\"I have a lot of offers, and I think people look up to me more,\" Daniels said, \"so I've got to lead the way.\"\n\nThis fall, he plans to continue setting the tone. He has been studying film and envisioning picks, exercises meant to prepare him for the final chapter of his high school career.\n\nHe'll be chasing a record. He'll be guiding a team. But more than anything, he'll be focused on making the next play.\n\n\"I'll be in the zone,\" Daniels said. \"There ain't nothing like a Friday night.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100, "id": 36, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "wgt": 100, "id": 96, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 100, "id": 284, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Homewood"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homewood,_Alabama", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homewood"}, "type": "loc", "id": "179484"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gainesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "181689"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "192018"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Memphis"}, "type": "loc", "id": "197239"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304975", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304976", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309405", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310130", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "321280", "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "321592", "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions#Special_teams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "322846", "label": {"eng": "Special teams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "329510", "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "334361", "label": {"eng": "University of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Memphis", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "356230", "label": {"eng": "University of Memphis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "369721", "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazelle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "394070", "label": {"eng": "Gazelle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_man", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "399956", "label": {"eng": "Hype man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homewood_High_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "641937", "label": {"eng": "Homewood High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Hargreaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1290032", "label": {"eng": "Vernon Hargreaves"}}]}

Daniels started off his argument about why the Confederate statues should stay standing by comparing those who mean to tear them down to ISIS.\n\n\"That's what ISIS is doing, There were pieces of history over there they didn't like, they're taking 'em down,\" Daniels began.\n\n\"Where does it go to Rita? I mean where does it stop? Is it just gonna be Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson or are we headed into Jefferson and Washington, who were both slave owners. How deep in history are we gonna go? Is everybody that we disagree with, we are gonna have to wipe every semblance of them out? Is that what this is all about? Is this where it's gonna end, is this where it's gonna go?\"\n\nPresident Trump made similar remarks in a press conference earlier this week, which he has stuck to in several tweets since then.\n\n\"I mean, come on! You don't have to condone what happened in the civil war,\" Daniels explained. \"We all know what it was fought for-you certainly don't have to condone it. But they are statues of people who are part of our history.\"\n\n\"If you don't like it, don't look at it,\" Daniels recommends. \"There's all kind of things, there's all kinds of symbolisms and things, in this country that I don't like. But I'm not gonna go tear 'em down, I just don't look at them.\"\n\n\"They're not standing there talking, these statues are not preaching, they're not saying anything, they're not shouting out some kind of crazy epithets or something, they're just sitting there. So just turn around and don't look at them,\" he repeated.\n\nAs for all the fuss about Trump's remarks condemning those involved in Charlottesville and the media making a big mess about it being \"too little too late,\" Daniels says people are expecting a politician even though that's not who they elected.\n\n\"The guy is a human being, he's not a politician,\" Daniels said of the president. \"I think that we tend to judge what he does by the reaction of politicians we've had been in office before because they're so conscious and so sensitive to political correctness and trying to react in a way that the press will favor and I mean he just won't do that.

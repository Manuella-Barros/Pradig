We are very sorry for the additional disruption this will cause. It will mean there may be disturbance overnight and we will do our best to keep noise and additional disruption to a minimum.\u201d Bramley resident Evan Venn said residents were in \"camping mode\", drinking bottled water. He said the main concern in the village was making sure deliveries of water supplies continued after some people had not received any. \"The traffic on Tuesday will be horrendous in this area,\" he added. On Saturday, it emerged repair works could take up to four weeks - and that the petrol leak had led to an underground explosion risk after it impacted the Openreach telecommunications network.", "summary": "Thames Water is replacing pipes and says Station Road in Bramley will be shut from Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0wwdx7wp1ro", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c86f/live/8faba3c0-20b3-11ef-baa7-25d483663b8e.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:08:02", "author": "Tanya Gupta", "authors": ["Tanya Gupta"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.042}

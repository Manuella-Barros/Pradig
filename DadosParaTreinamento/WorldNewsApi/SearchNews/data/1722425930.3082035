The abandoned holiday is the clearest indicator that the 24-year-old didn\u2019t see the call-up coming, but you only had to watch his performances at blindside for Ulster to understand why he merited a place on the squad. Standing 2.01m and weighing in at 117kg, he has a turn of pace and excellent footwork that saw him initially recruited into the Ireland Sevens programme from Scottish club rugby before the northern province signed him in 2020. It\u2019s been quite a route to the Ireland squad. \u201cIt was probably playing Prem 2 in Scotland for Kelso against teams you\u2019ve probably never heard of or ever will,\u201d he smiles when asked what was the furthest point from here. \u201cI was 18, went over, got 50 quid a week in a brown envelope and I was living in a town of like 3,000, travelling all over Scotland.\u201d Having started out playing club rugby in Tullamore, Izuchukwu did the senior cycle at Cistercian Roscrea where he was a rangy centre. He took the chance to move to Kelso, a small town midway between Edinburgh and Newcastle, and initially lived with New Zealander Gary Stevens who invested plenty of time into him and encouraged him to move into the forwards. It wasn\u2019t glamorous, but it was an important step. \u201cGary did a bit of New Zealand U-20s [coaching] and he did Crusaders so he had that professional background. He coached James Lowe at some point, small world. \u201cWhen I first moved over to that club the house wasn\u2019t really set up properly, because they had a history of players coming that were quite bad so I actually had to sleep in his sitting room until they realised I was good and then they gave me a proper house to live in. \u201cWhen I was living with him for those three days I probably learned the most I ever have in my career\u2026 I played some good rugby there.\u201d He\u2019s been on an upward curve since coming home and he went to South Africa on the 2022 Emerging Ireland tour before a serious knee injury interrupted his rise. Having shone at No 6 for Ulster, he\u2019s been training as a second-row with Ireland and he\u2019s competing with some heavy hitters going into the series but he\u2019s hoping to see some action now that he\u2019s in the squad. \u201cIf I get to play it would be class,\u201d he said. \u201cI have obviously played against a couple of them, against the Sharks, but I love doing it so if I get a chance I hope I am not too nervous and get a chance to whack someone\u2026 \u201cThey are a real passionate country, everyone I\u2019ve always met from South Africa, they are always 100 per cent into what they are doing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good opportunity for me to learn whether I am playing or not. It will be class to be over there and get a look in behind the scenes, because even at club level you never really know what is going on in terms of the atmosphere in the stadium and the dressing rooms.\u201d If he gets a first cap, perhaps then he\u2019ll have earned that tequila.", "summary": "<p>Cormac Izuchukwu thought he\u2019d be in Tequila, Mexico right now sampling the local wares, but the call came from Andy Farrell and his mates will have to do without him as he gets used to life in the Ireland camp in Johannesburg.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/its-going-to-be-a-good-opportunity-for-me-to-learn-ambitious-cormac-izuchukwu-puts-tequila-on-hold-for-south-africa-tour/a2472376.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/A2i7--xwIAMX664oSWMVCBtgP2w=/0x29:3150x2129/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/155f5d0a-e762-4629-ab13-f7e9d65cbb65/0ee9f74f-c468-403f-82b8-c3131dfaffe5/155f5d0a-e762-4629-ab13-f7e9d65cbb65.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:30:00", "author": "R\u00faaidhr\u00ed O'connor", "authors": ["R\u00faaidhr\u00ed O'connor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.0}

{"id": 227491318, "title": "Nvidia\u2019s Project G-Assist AI: No More Googling For Help With Games?", "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Nvidia's AI assistant will help gamers with advice and tips getty Nvidia is working on a new AI assistant that might mean you never need Google for help with a game again. Dubbed Project G-Assist, the AI assistant will appear as an overlay while you\u2019re playing games, allowing gamers to ask questions about the title they\u2019re playing. The AI will be \u201ccontext aware\u201d, meaning it can see your current progress in the game and recommend actions that are relevant to that stage in proceedings. Nvidia demonstrated the technology with ARK: Survival Ascended, a game in which the player finds themselves trapped on a prehistoric island with dinosaurs and other beasts, and must find a way to survive. The demo showed a player asking questions such as: \u201cwhat\u2019s the best early-game weapon and where do I find the crafting materials for it?\u201d. The AI assistant instantly advised that the best early-game weapon was a spear. The AI was also able to understand which resources the player had gathered, allowing it to make recommendations about which crafting recipes to unlock next, for example. So, will this be the death knell for content creators who publish game guides and wikis that help players progress through games? \u201cIn the future, we envision these assistants will be implemented by game developers and also by the communities themselves,\u201d said Jesse Clayton, director of product marketing for Windows AI at Nvidia, adding that the company would also seek to work with \u201cwiki sites, press sites who have guides and walkthroughs and lots of knowledge about specific games.\u201d He also hinted that the AI wouldn't go rogue and show players how to cheat at games, for example, by adding that Nvidia would work in \u201ccollaboration with game developers to ensure that these assistants align with developer objectives for the game.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Samsung Documents Confirm Missing Galaxy Z Fold 6 Feature World No 1 Djokovic Survives 5 Set Epic To Advance In French Open Match That Ends After 3 AM Apple Insider Details An Expensive iPhone Pro Decision Project G-Assist isn\u2019t the first AI assistant to provide gaming advice. Alternatives such as ChatGPT are already capable of helping gamers with specific queries about a game or to provide starter guides for newcomers to a particular title. The key difference with Nvidia\u2019s offering is that the player won\u2019t need to leave the game to seek help. Project G-Assist appears as an overlay inside the game, meaning the player doesn\u2019t have to pause the action or switch windows to get AI advice. Game Performance Boosts Project G-Assist won\u2019t only provide gameplay tips and tricks, it will also help PC players tweak the performance of their computer hardware. \u2018The AI understands your system and can help tune and optimize it for you,\u201d said Clayton. \u201cIt can provide insights into performance metrics like fps [frames per second] and PC latency, for example, and track these for you as you tweak your PC for more responsiveness.\u201d The AI can also scan the PC to ensure that the player is, for example, taking full advantage of their display\u2019s capabilities. \u201cIt may suggest optimal graphics settings for your particular setup, or even overclocking, or find ways to consume less power while maintaining a target of 60fps,\u201d Clayton added. Project G-Assist is merely a tech demonstration at this stage, with Nvidia not yet prepared to reveal when the AI assistant will be made available to the public or how much it might cost. Project G-Assist is just one of a series of announcements Nvidia is making at the Computex tech show in Taipei this week, including enhancements to its software that allows games developers to create AI-driven characters in games and a new initiative to standardize graphics cards for small form-factor PCs.

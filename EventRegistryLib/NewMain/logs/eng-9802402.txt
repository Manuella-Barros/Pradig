Seconds later, a Secret Service sniper shot and killed Crooks.\n\nAfter the encounter, the officer runs around to another side of the building before running to his police car to retrieve a rifle.\n\n\"F**king this close bro,\" the officer who saw Crooks says to another officer. \"Dude, he turned around on me.\"\n\nOne officer asks where the shooter is and the officer, panting, says, \"He's straight up.\"\n\n\"Who's got eyes on him?\" the officer asks. \"He was right where you picked me up, bro. He was on that left side.\"\n\nOver the radio a voice says: \"We have two civilians - tending to them,\" and later, \"I need an ambulance in the back.\"\n\nThis video was released by Butler Township Police Department in response to CNN's public records request that asked for any body-camera video or dash-camera video involving Butler Township officers or personnel related to the rally and shooting at Butler Farm Show on July 13. The township initially declined to release the content but did after CNN appealed.\n\n'Don't put up your head - he's right there'\n\nOn the dashboard camera of the officer who came face-to-face with Crooks, three shots can be heard ringing out, followed by five more shots fired in rapid succession.\n\n\"Don't put up your head - he's right there!\" the officer shouts to others after opening his car half a minute after the shots were fired.\n\nShortly after, video shows law enforcement officers attempting to access the roof.\n\n\"He's got glasses, long hair,\" the officer who saw Crooks tells several others climbing up the side of the building. \"Yo, Mike, I climbed the wall and I popped my head right in front of him bro, he's got a book bag, he's got mad sh*t, AR laying down.\"\n\n\"But watch out because he can f**king come right down on you over there,\" the officer warns.\n\nThe officer adds later: \"Before you m*therf**kers came up here I popped my head up there like an idiot, by myself, dude. He turned around, I f**king dropped.\"\n\nWhen they ultimately access the top of the building, footage shows Crooks' lifeless body, his rifle and a trail of blood running down the side of the roof.\n\nOfficers say they asked for Secret Service help earlier that week\n\nIn a separate video released by the Butler police, one officer can be heard telling colleagues about 10 minutes after the shooting that he had told Secret Service to post law enforcement by the building that Crooks fired from.\n\n\"I f**king told them they need to post the guys f**king over here,\" the officer said. \"I told them that, the f**king, the Secret Service, I told them that f**king Tuesday. I told them to post f**king guys over here.\"\n\nAnother officer replied that he wasn't \"even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof. I thought that's how we -- how in the hell can you lose a guy walking back here?\"\n\n\"I talked to the Secret Service guys, they were like, 'Yeah, no problem, we're going to post guys over here,'\" the first officer said.\n\nSecret Service posted three local counter snipers inside one of the adjacent buildings, one of whom took pictures of Crooks earlier that day and left his post to go looking for the soon-to-be shooter.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Secret Service said it is reviewing the newly released body-camera video.\n\n\"The U.S. Secret service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,\" said Anthony Guglielmi, an agency spokesperson. \"The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was a U.S. Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\"\n\nDocuments from shooting range show Crooks' preparation\n\nOn Thursday, Sen. Chuck Grassley released documents obtained from the shooter's gun club that revealed new details about Crooks's preparation in the months leading up to the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nThe records from Clairton Sportsmen's Club, reviewed by CNN, show Crooks visited the gun range a total of 43 times after establishing a membership on August 10, 2023 - less than a year before the assassination attempt\n\nSign-in sheets provided to Grassley, an Iowa Republican, by Clairton Sportsmen's Club also indicate Crooks spent the majority of his time at the rifle range - rather than other designated areas for firing pistols or shotguns - in the months immediately preceding the rally where he ultimately used the same type of weapon to shoot Trump.\n\nCrooks attended target practice at the club three to six times per month in 2024, before making one final visit at 2:45 p.m. on Friday, July 12, 2024 - the day before the Trump rally, according to the records obtained by Grassley.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The incident occurred during a campaign rally where Crooks fired at Trump, grazing the former US president's ear and resulting in the death of a rallygoer.\n\nThe footage shows one officer hoisting another onto the roof of the American Glass Research building, where Crooks was located approximately 12 feet above the ground. As the officer reached the roof, Crooks pointed his weapon at him, causing the officer to duck and lose his grip, falling about eight feet and spraining his ankle. Seconds later, Crooks opened fire, leading to the chaos that ensued at the rally.\n\nButler County Sheriff Michael Slupe said that the officers' intervention likely saved Trump's life by distracting the shooter. \"If I'm interrupted, and I move my gun, you are going to have to reassess that whole situation,\" Slupe said. \"Timing is everything,\" he added, noting that the interruption allowed Trump to turn his head just in time to avoid a more serious injury.\n\nThe release of the bodycam footage is part of ongoing investigations into the security failures that allowed Crooks to get within 150 yards of Trump and open fire. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe acknowledged that video footage of a figure moving along the roof shortly before the shooting indicates a \"failure\" in security measures.\n\nThe FBI has revealed that Crooks arrived at the rally site at 11 am. on the day of the shooting and spent an hour there before leaving, only to return at 3:50 pm. Local law enforcement first spotted him around 5:10 pm, approximately 50 minutes before Trump was scheduled to take the stage. During his second visit, Crooks flew a drone near the rally site, but the FBI later reported that no photos or videos were taken from it.\n\nAs investigations continue, questions remain about the motives behind the shooting. FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate indicated that Crooks' social media activity contained anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes. The US Secret Service meanwhile faces scrutiny over its handling of security for the event, with lawmakers demanding accountability for the lapses that led to the assassination attempt.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\u2013style_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AR-15\u2013style rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPMS_Panther_Arms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DPMS Panther Arms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Three rallygoers were also shot, including Corey Comperatore, 50, who was killed protecting his family from danger.\n\nDavid Dutch and James Copenhaver were injured after being shot at the rally. They have both since returned home with Dutch on Wednesday providing Fox News with an exclusive statement on the deadly incident.\n\nThe footage is the latest crucial piece of publicly available information released that attempts to shed light on exactly what transpired that day and what efforts were put in place to stop Crooks.\n\nThe security breaches that paved the way for the shooting have been muddied by finger-pointing among the various agencies involved at the local, state and federal levels.\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said video of someone moving along a roof minutes before former President Trump was shot confirms a \"failure.\"\n\nThe video, exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital video, taken by victim Copenhaver, shows a figure moving across the roof of the American Glass Research (AGR) building just minutes before gunfire rang out at Trump's rally.\n\nThe FBI previously revealed that Crooks had driven to the rally site at 11 a.m. on the day of the shooting and spent an hour there before heading home.\n\nCrooks did not return to the scene until 3:50 p.m. Local law enforcement officers, in their designated positions, spotted him for the first time around 5:10 p.m. -- approximately 50 minutes before Trump took the stage, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who obtained them from the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit (ESU).\n\nOn his return to the rally site, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards away from where Trump was going to be speaking, according to the FBI. The FBI later said that no photos or videos were taken from the drone and that the agency found no memory card in the drone.\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: NEW TEXTS SHOW LOCAL POLICE SCRAMBLE TO ASSIST WITH COVERING RALLY\n\nAt 5:30 p.m., local law enforcement snapped a picture of Crooks and escalated it to command.\n\n\"Kid learning around building we are in,\" an officer wrote in a text message, along with an image of Crooks. \"AGR I believe it is. I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out.\"\n\n\"I lost sight of him,\" the officer added.\n\nA follow-up message said: \"Call it in to command and have a uniform check it out.\"\n\nButler County Sheriff Michael Slupe told the New York Post previously that the officers who interrupted Crooks likely provided enough of a distraction to save Trump's life.\n\n\"If I'm interrupted, and I move my gun, you are going to have to reassess that whole situation at this point, so yes, you can make a case that those two officers saved the president's life,\" Slupe told the outlet.\n\nSlupe said \"timing is everything,\" and the interruption to the shooter bought Trump the seconds he needed to miraculously turn his head so that the bullet struck only his ear.\n\n\"Can you imagine 10 seconds before that?\" the sheriff asked. \"That the president was looking straight ahead and where that bullet could have potentially landed.\"\n\nFox News Digital is reviewing the bodycam footage.

They reveal for the first time the critical moments -- starting around 6:08 p.m. -- when officers establish Crooks' location, frantically try to find a way to get onto the roof and determine that he is armed. By around 6:11, Crooks opens fire.\n\nBefore the release of the videos, the exact movements of nearby law enforcement officers -- and the actions they took to address a newly identified threat -- were unclear. Testimony from state police and Secret Service officials provided some details, but the footage obtained by The New York Times through a public records request gives the first second-by-second retelling from the perspectives of two of the officers near the gunman at the time of the shooting.\n\nThe footage also raises more questions as to why the Secret Service failed to remove Trump from the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, while local law enforcement officers were scrambling to get to Crooks, even if they weren't yet aware that he had a firearm.\n\nThe footage analyzed by the Times includes 12 videos released Thursday by the Butler Township Police Department, showing at least three Butler officers and one Pennsylvania state trooper focused on the roof from where Crooks fired. Eyewitness footage previously published on YouTube shows that a fifth law enforcement officer was also responding in the same area.\n\nThe earliest body camera video captured near the complex of warehouse buildings, owned by AGR International, begins seven minutes before the shooting.\n\nAt first, some officers appear to be responding to reports, documented in text messages and an after-action report obtained by the Times, that a suspicious person is moving away from the rally.\n\nAn officer is seen searching in the nearby woods at 6:04 p.m. While the officer is surveying this area, Crooks is about 270 yards away, scaling a building at the opposite end of the complex. At 6:08 p.m. the body camera of the officer captures Crooks walking on the roof of one of the buildings, which are connected by catwalks. It's unclear if the officer sees Crooks.\n\nAnother officer arrives at the scene in his vehicle at 6:09 p.m. At this point, videos show five officers scattered near the building from which Crooks would later fire. The state trooper stands on a picnic table to look for the suspicious person on the roof while bystanders look on.\n\nThen, four officers congregate on the east side of the building.\n\nThere, the officer who has just arrived by car is hoisted up so he can see onto the roof. According to previous testimony by Col. Christopher Paris of the state police, the officer made eye contact with the gunman, but dropped back to the ground when Crooks pointed the gun at him.\n\nHe then communicated over the radio that Crooks had a gun, according to testimony last week from Ronald Rowe Jr., the acting Secret Service director. Rowe added that the radio message had never made it to the Secret Service.\n\nVideo shows the officer running back around the building.\n\nAbout 40 seconds after the officer sees him over the side of the building, at 6:11 p.m., Crooks fires. The officer flinches and retreats from the building as a Pennsylvania state trooper is seen pointing a rifle at the roof. Crooks is shot by a Secret Service sniper shortly after.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, law enforcement are seen still scrambling to gain access to the roof, shouting for a ladder. In a body camera video that had audio enabled, the officer who had made eye contact with Crooks describes the shooter's appearance, warning the other officers to \"watch out because he can (expletive) come right down on you over there\" -- apparently not yet sure that Crooks has been killed.\n\nTen minutes after the shooting, the cameras capture multiple officers on the roof next to Crooks' body, visibly distraught by their inability to stop the shooting.\n\n\"What are the chances, what are the (expletive) chances,\" says one officer. At the same time, outside the building, another officer says that he warned the Secret Service to guard the area days earlier. \"I told them to post (expletive) guys over here.\"\n\nOn another camera, an officer said in frustration, \"We were watching him.\"\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, a Secret Service spokesperson, said the agency was reviewing the body camera footage and called the attempted assassination a \"Secret Service failure.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dashcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Township,_Luzerne_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/QE71qpsTDFZwnAWcNz6Vo6LCgwk=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/NLECNM5PBEWR2CBOZ25537FAJA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1088, "textEnd": 1095}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Dude, he turned around on me,\" the officer who was hoisted can be heard saying later on in bodycam video released Thursday.\n\nOne officer can be seen hoisting another officer onto the roof where Crooks was stationed, which is about 12 feet above the ground.\n\nPAKISTANI MAN WITH TIES TO IRAN CHARGED IN FOILED ASSASSINATION PLOT POTENTIALLY TARGETING TRUMP, DOJ SAYS\n\nCrooks pointed his weapon at the officer who scaled the building, before the officer ultimately ducks his head and loses his grip on the roof's edge and falls about 8 feet to the ground, spraining his ankle, Butler Township Manager Thomas Knights previously told Fox News Digital.\n\nThe footage captures Crooks toward the end as officers surround his body after countersnipers fatally shot him.\n\n\"I'm f---ing p---ed. We couldn't find him,\" another officer can be heard saying in the bodycam footage.\n\n\"Before you motherf---ers came up here, I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself, dude,\" the officer who was boosted onto the roof says. \"Then he turned around and I f---ing dropped and I started f---ing I was calling out, 'bro, f---ing on top of the roof. F---ing we're not on the same frequency?\"\n\nButler Township PD Lt. Matthew Pearson told a local outlet that the officer was unable to draw his weapon since he was hanging from the building.\n\nSeconds later, Crooks opened fire and grazed Trump's right ear. Three rallygoers were also shot, including Comperatore, 50, who was killed protecting his family from danger.\n\nDavid Dutch and James Copenhaver were injured after being shot at the rally. They have both since returned home, and Copenhaver's attorney provided an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital as he continues to recover.\n\nOfficers can be seen standing over Crooks' body on the roof in the footage released Thursday.\n\nIn other bodycam video, officers are clearly confused about why the roof of the American Glass Research (AGR) building, where Crooks shot from, was unmanned.\n\n\"I thought you were on the roof?\" one officer says.\n\nThere also appears to be confusion about whether the shooter was neutralized and why the shooter wasn't taken out before he opened fire.\n\n\"If you'd all had a gun up there ... I'd have shot him. He wouldn't have ripped out a gun up there,\" one officer says in the bodycam.\n\nThe footage is the latest crucial piece of publicly available information released that attempts to shed light on exactly what transpired that day and what efforts were put in place to stop Crooks.\n\nThe security breaches that paved the way for the shooting have been muddied by finger-pointing among the various agencies involved at the local, state and federal levels.\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said video of someone moving along a roof minutes before Trump was shot confirms a \"failure.\"\n\nThe video, taken by Copenhaver and exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, shows a figure moving across the roof of the AGR building just minutes before gunfire rang out at Trump's rally.\n\nThe FBI previously revealed that Crooks had driven to the rally site at 11 a.m. on the day of the shooting and spent an hour there before heading home.\n\nCrooks did not return to the scene until 3:50 p.m. Local law enforcement officers, in their designated positions, spotted him for the first time around 5:10 p.m. -- approximately 50 minutes before Trump took the stage, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who obtained them from the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit (ESU).\n\nOn his return to the rally site, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards away from where Trump was going to be speaking, according to the FBI. The FBI later said that no photos or videos were taken from the drone and that the agency found no memory card in the drone.\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: NEW TEXTS SHOW LOCAL POLICE SCRAMBLE TO ASSIST WITH COVERING RALLY\n\nAt 5:30 p.m., local law enforcement snapped a picture of Crooks and escalated it to command.\n\n\"Kid learning around building we are in,\" an officer wrote in a text message, along with an image of Crooks. \"AGR I believe it is. I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out.\"\n\n\"I lost sight of him,\" the officer added.\n\nA follow-up message said: \"Call it in to command and have a uniform check it out.\"\n\nBy 6:12 p.m., the \"kid\" would be killed by a counter-sniper after he opened fired on the rallygoers.\n\nOn the day of the rally, Crooks parked his vehicle and flew a drone between about 3:50 p.m. and 4 p.m. about 200 yards from where the former president would be speaking on July 13. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified during a July 17 congressional hearing that Crooks had been at the rally site for about 70 minutes the morning of the assassination attempt.\n\nLINK: GET UPDATES AND MORE ON THIS REPORT FROM FOX NEWS", "source": {"uri": "fox4news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Township,_Luzerne_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Gas-cooled_Reactor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Matthew Pearson, the acting chief of the Butler Township Police Department, shared the bodycam footage with the Washington Examiner. The videos show the experiences of several officers who responded before, during, and after the shooting and paint a clearer picture of how Thomas Crooks was able to fire on Trump despite being confronted.\n\n\"F***ing this close, bro, he turned around on me,\" said the officer who was hoisted up onto the American Glass Research building where Crooks was stationed.\n\nNew revelations in the bodycam footage\n\nThe footage, of which some of the audio was redacted, shows a police officer running toward the building at 6:10 p.m., just one minute before Trump was shot. Moments later, he was hoisted up by another officer and is shown on video peeking over the roof for a brief moment before Crooks, who cannot be seen at this point, turned his gun on him.\n\nClinging to the roof and unable to draw his weapon, the officer fell approximately 8 feet down and sprained his ankle. Seconds later, at 6:11, Crooks opened fire. All of the audio from the officer's body camera before 6:12 was redacted.\n\nAfter the officer fell from the roof, he can be seen on video sprinting to warn other police officers. He asked, \"Who's got eyes on him?\" and helped a team of officers carrying rifles, who were attempting to scale the wrong part of the building, to locate Crooks. He alerted others that the shooter had a \"full kit,\" long hair, glasses, and a bag and that he was \"laying down, prone out\" on the roof.\n\nNone of the officers on the ground appeared to be aware that Crooks was killed seconds after he fired on Trump and the rallygoers. Minutes after the shooting, an officer who spotted a deceased Crooks on the roof shouted, \"Hold, hold, hold, he's got a f***ing gun.\"\n\nEventually, the officer who confronted Crooks made it to the roof with backup, and the footage shows the shooter dead on the metal roof with a stream of blood that spanned from the peak of the roof's slope in the middle of the building to the edge.\n\nIn other footage, four officers can be seen carrying a body covered in blood to a white tent. The reactions of numerous rallygoers were also captured on video, including several who claimed to have seen the shooter die from counter-sniper fire.\n\n\"I seen his head pop off,\" one person said. Another chimed in, saying, \"He's dead.\"\n\nOne rallygoer can be heard questioning how Crooks made it up to the roof unnoticed because \"they got snipers on the roof.\"\n\nIn the footage, officers can be heard speculating about how Crooks scaled the roof of the AGR building. One officer asked about a ladder, while another suggested that he used a wooden plank propped up near a pallet and a plastic shed.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nCrooks's body was found in possession of a \"bloodied receipt\" for a five-foot ladder, but the FBI does not believe he used it to carry out the attack.\n\n'Can you imagine': Local police may have saved Trump's life\n\nThe officer who confronted Crooks and the officer who hoisted him up onto the building may have actually saved Trump's life by buying him the few seconds he needed to \"miraculously\" turn his head, according to Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe.\n\n\"Can you imagine 10 seconds before that?\" Slupe said. \"That the president was looking straight ahead and where that bullet could have potentially landed.\"\n\nThe Butler County Sheriff defended the officer from criticism that he didn't do more to stop Crooks, who was just 130 yards away from the former president. He framed it as a decision between \"I'm dead or I drop\" -- either way, the officer wasn't going to be able to stop the shooter.\n\n\"When someone points a gun at you and you can't get to your weapon, you tell them a**holes online that they are Superman,\" Slupe said. \"Like, 'I'll just pull a gun out and they can shoot at me. I don't give a s***.' Yeah. Mm-hm. Right, right.\"\n\nCrooks went to shooting range one day before rally: New report\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who was the first to release bodycam footage to the public on July 25, released 46 pages of documents about Crooks's membership at the Clairton Sportsmen's Club, a local gun club.\n\nGrassley's report, which his staff shared with the Washington Examiner, shows that Crooks established membership at the club on Aug. 10, 2023, less than a year before the attempted assassination. He visited the range 43 times and signed in for target practice 20 times in his first four months of membership. In 2024, he attended target practice approximately once a week on average.\n\nCrooks's final visit to the shooting range was at 2:45 p.m. on July 12, just one day before he opened fire on Trump using a DPMS AR-15 rifle that his father purchased.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhile records show Crooks practiced on the rifle range more frequently than the pistol range, spending about 80% of his time at the gun club practicing his rifle shooting, he focused almost exclusively on the rifle range in 2024.\n\nThe report additionally reveals that Crooks has spent some holidays at the range, including Christmas Day, Valentine's Day, and Halloween, and that Clairton Sportsmen's Club was used by Department of Homeland Security officers for \"police training\" on May 23.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "washington_examiner@gazette.com",

They reveal for the first time the critical moments -- starting around 6:08 p.m. -- when officers establish Crooks' location, frantically try to find a way to get onto the roof and determine that he is armed. By around 6:11, Crooks opens fire.\n\nBefore the release of the videos, the exact movements of nearby law enforcement officers -- and the actions they took to address a newly identified threat -- were unclear. Testimony from state police and Secret Service officials provided some details, but the footage obtained by The New York Times through a public records request gives the first second-by-second retelling from the perspectives of two of the officers near the gunman at the time of the shooting.\n\nThe footage also raises more questions as to why the Secret Service failed to remove Trump from the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, while local law enforcement officers were scrambling to get to Crooks, even if they weren't yet aware that he had a firearm.\n\nThe footage analyzed by the Times includes 12 videos released Thursday by the Butler Township Police Department, showing at least three Butler officers and one Pennsylvania state trooper focused on the roof from where Crooks fired. Eyewitness footage previously published on YouTube shows that a fifth law enforcement officer was also responding in the same area.\n\nThe earliest body camera video captured near the complex of warehouse buildings, owned by AGR International, begins seven minutes before the shooting.\n\nAt first, some officers appear to be responding to reports, documented in text messages and an after-action report obtained by the Times, that a suspicious person is moving away from the rally.\n\nAn officer is seen searching in the nearby woods at 6:04 p.m. While the officer is surveying this area, Crooks is about 270 yards away, scaling a building at the opposite end of the complex. At 6:08 p.m. the body camera of the officer captures Crooks walking on the roof of one of the buildings, which are connected by catwalks. It's unclear if the officer sees Crooks.\n\nAnother officer arrives at the scene in his vehicle at 6:09 p.m. At this point, videos show five officers scattered near the building from which Crooks would later fire. The state trooper stands on a picnic table to look for the suspicious person on the roof while bystanders look on.\n\nThen, four officers congregate on the east side of the building.\n\nThere, the officer who has just arrived by car is hoisted up so he can see onto the roof. According to previous testimony by Col. Christopher Paris of the state police, the officer made eye contact with the gunman, but dropped back to the ground when Crooks pointed the gun at him.\n\nHe then communicated over the radio that Crooks had a gun, according to testimony last week from Ronald Rowe Jr., the acting Secret Service director. Rowe added that the radio message had never made it to the Secret Service.\n\nVideo shows the officer running back around the building.\n\nAbout 40 seconds after the officer sees him over the side of the building, at 6:11 p.m., Crooks fires. The officer flinches and retreats from the building as a Pennsylvania state trooper is seen pointing a rifle at the roof. Crooks is shot by a Secret Service sniper shortly after.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, law enforcement are seen still scrambling to gain access to the roof, shouting for a ladder. In a body camera video that had audio enabled, the officer who had made eye contact with Crooks describes the shooter's appearance, warning the other officers to \"watch out because he can (expletive) come right down on you over there\" -- apparently not yet sure that Crooks has been killed.\n\nTen minutes after the shooting, the cameras capture multiple officers on the roof next to Crooks' body, visibly distraught by their inability to stop the shooting.\n\n\"What are the chances, what are the (expletive) chances,\" says one officer. At the same time, outside the building, another officer says that he warned the Secret Service to guard the area days earlier. \"I told them to post (expletive) guys over here.\"\n\nOn another camera, an officer said in frustration, \"We were watching him.\"\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, a Secret Service spokesperson, said the agency was reviewing the body camera footage and called the attempted assassination a \"Secret Service failure.\"\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,\" Guglielmi said. \"We are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dashcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Office_Products/Furniture", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Office Products/Furniture", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Office_Products", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Office Products", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/unnamed-file-1130.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1408, "textEnd": 1415}], "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Matthew Pearson told a local outlet that the officer was unable to draw his weapon since he was hanging from the building.\n\nSeconds later, Crooks opened fire and grazed Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right ear. Three rallygoers were also shot, including Corey Comperatore, 50, who was killed protecting his family from danger.\n\nDavid Dutch and James Copenhaver were injured after being shot at the rally. They have both since returned home with Dutch on Wednesday providing Fox News with an exclusive statement on the deadly incident.\n\nThe footage is the latest crucial piece of publicly available information released that attempts to shed light on exactly what transpired that day and what efforts were put in place to stop Crooks.\n\nThe security breaches that paved the way for the shooting have been muddied by finger-pointing among the various agencies involved at the local, state and federal levels.\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said video of someone moving along a roof minutes before former President Trump was shot confirms a \"failure.\"\n\nThe video, exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital video, taken by victim Copenhaver, shows a figure moving across the roof of the American Glass Research (AGR) building just minutes before gunfire rang out at Trump's rally.\n\nThe FBI previously revealed that Crooks had driven to the rally site at 11 a.m. on the day of the shooting and spent an hour there before heading home.\n\nCrooks did not return to the scene until 3:50 p.m. Local law enforcement officers, in their designated positions, spotted him for the first time around 5:10 p.m. \u00e2\u0080\" approximately 50 minutes before Trump took the stage, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who obtained them from the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit (ESU).\n\nOn his return to the rally site, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards away from where Trump was going to be speaking, according to the FBI. The FBI later said that no photos or videos were taken from the drone and that the agency found no memory card in the drone.\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: NEW TEXTS SHOW LOCAL POLICE SCRAMBLE TO ASSIST WITH COVERING RALLY\n\nAt 5:30 p.m., local law enforcement snapped a picture of Crooks and escalated it to command.\n\nVIDEO SHOWS TRUMP SHOOTING VICTIM'S POV\n\n\"Kid learning around building we are in,\" an officer wrote in a text message, along with an image of Crooks. \"AGR I believe it is. I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out.\"\n\n\"I lost sight of him,\" the officer added.\n\nA follow-up message said: \"Call it in to command and have a uniform check it out.\"\n\nButler County Sheriff Michael Slupe told the New York Post previously that the officers who interrupted Crooks likely provided enough of a distraction to save Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life.\n\n\"If I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m interrupted, and I move my gun, you are going to have to reassess that whole situation at this point, so yes, you can make a case that those two officers saved the president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life,\" Slupe told the outlet.\n\nSlupe said \"timing is everything,\" and the interruption to the shooter bought Trump the seconds he needed to miraculously turn his head so that the bullet struck only his ear.\n\n\"Can you imagine 10 seconds before that?\" the sheriff asked. \"That the president was looking straight ahead and where that bullet could have potentially landed.\"\n\nFox News Digital is reviewing the bodycam footage.

Seconds later, a Secret Service sniper shot and killed Crooks.\n\nAfter the encounter, the officer runs around to another side of the building before running to his police car to retrieve a rifle.\n\n\"F**king this close bro,\" the officer who saw Crooks says to another officer. \"Dude, he turned around on me.\"\n\nOne officer asks where the shooter is and the officer, panting, says, \"He's straight up.\"\n\n\"Who's got eyes on him?\" the officer asks. \"He was right where you picked me up, bro. He was on that left side.\"\n\nOver the radio a voice says: \"We have two civilians - tending to them,\" and later, \"I need an ambulance in the back.\"\n\nThis video was released by Butler Township Police Department in response to CNN's public records request that asked for any body-camera video or dash-camera video involving Butler Township officers or personnel related to the rally and shooting at Butler Farm Show on July 13. The township initially declined to release the content but did after CNN appealed.\n\nOn the dashboard camera of the officer who came face-to-face with Crooks, three shots can be heard ringing out, followed by five more shots fired in rapid succession.\n\n\"Don't put up your head - he's right there!\" the officer shouts to others after opening his car half a minute after the shots were fired.\n\nShortly after, video shows law enforcement officers attempting to access the roof.\n\n\"He's got glasses, long hair,\" the officer who saw Crooks tells several others climbing up the side of the building. \"Yo, Mike, I climbed the wall and I popped my head right in front of him bro, he's got a book bag, he's got mad sh*t, AR laying down.\"\n\n\"But watch out because he can f**king come right down on you over there,\" the officer warns.\n\nThe officer adds later: \"Before you m*therf**kers came up here I popped my head up there like an idiot, by myself, dude. He turned around, I f**king dropped.\"\n\nWhen they ultimately access the top of the building, footage shows Crooks' lifeless body, his rifle and a trail of blood running down the side of the roof.\n\nIn a separate video released by the Butler police, one officer can be heard telling colleagues about 10 minutes after the shooting that he had told Secret Service to post law enforcement by the building that Crooks fired from.\n\n\"I f**king told them they need to post the guys f**king over here,\" the officer said. \"I told them that, the f**king, the Secret Service, I told them that f**king Tuesday. I told them to post f**king guys over here.\"\n\nAnother officer replied that he wasn't \"even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof. I thought that's how we -- how in the hell can you lose a guy walking back here?\"\n\n\"I talked to the Secret Service guys, they were like, 'Yeah, no problem, we're going to post guys over here,'\" the first officer said.\n\nSecret Service posted three local counter snipers inside one of the adjacent buildings, one of whom took pictures of Crooks earlier that day and left his post to go looking for the soon-to-be shooter.\n\nOn Thursday, Sen. Chuck Grassley released documents obtained from the shooter's gun club that revealed new details about Crooks's preparation in the months leading up to the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nThe records from Clairton Sportsmen's Club, reviewed by CNN, show Crooks visited the gun range a total of 43 times after establishing a membership on August 10, 2023 - less than a year before the assassination attempt\n\nSign-in sheets provided to Grassley, an Iowa Republican, by Clairton Sportsmen's Club also indicate Crooks spent the majority of his time at the rifle range - rather than other designated areas for firing pistols or shotguns - in the months immediately preceding the rally where he ultimately used the same type of weapon to shoot Trump.\n\nCrooks attended target practice at the club three to six times per month in 2024, before making one final visit at 2:45 p.m. on Friday, July 12, 2024 - the day before the Trump rally, according to the records obtained by Grassley.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Seconds later, a Secret Service sniper shot and killed Crooks.\n\nAfter the encounter, the officer runs around to another side of the building before running to his police car to retrieve a rifle.\n\n\"F**king this close bro,\" the officer who saw Crooks says to another officer. \"Dude, he turned around on me.\"\n\nOne officer asks where the shooter is and the officer, panting, says, \"He's straight up.\"\n\n\"Who's got eyes on him?\" the officer asks. \"He was right where you picked me up, bro. He was on that left side.\"\n\nOver the radio a voice says: \"We have two civilians - tending to them,\" and later, \"I need an ambulance in the back.\"\n\nThis video was released by Butler Township Police Department in response to CNN's public records request that asked for any body-camera video or dash-camera video involving Butler Township officers or personnel related to the rally and shooting at Butler Farm Show on July 13. The township initially declined to release the content but did after CNN appealed.\n\n'Don't put up your head - he's right there'\n\nOn the dashboard camera of the officer who came face-to-face with Crooks, three shots can be heard ringing out, followed by five more shots fired in rapid succession.\n\n\"Don't put up your head - he's right there!\" the officer shouts to others after opening his car half a minute after the shots were fired.\n\nShortly after, video shows law enforcement officers attempting to access the roof.\n\n\"He's got glasses, long hair,\" the officer who saw Crooks tells several others climbing up the side of the building. \"Yo, Mike, I climbed the wall and I popped my head right in front of him bro, he's got a book bag, he's got mad sh*t, AR laying down.\"\n\n\"But watch out because he can f**king come right down on you over there,\" the officer warns.\n\nThe officer adds later: \"Before you m*therf**kers came up here I popped my head up there like an idiot, by myself, dude. He turned around, I f**king dropped.\"\n\nWhen they ultimately access the top of the building, footage shows Crooks' lifeless body, his rifle and a trail of blood running down the side of the roof.\n\nOfficers say they asked for Secret Service help earlier that week\n\nIn a separate video released by the Butler police, one officer can be heard telling colleagues about 10 minutes after the shooting that he had told Secret Service to post law enforcement by the building that Crooks fired from.\n\n\"I f**king told them they need to post the guys f**king over here,\" the officer said. \"I told them that, the f**king, the Secret Service, I told them that f**king Tuesday.

Matthew Pearson, the acting chief of the Butler Township Police Department, shared the body cam footage with the Washington Examiner. The videos show the experiences of several officers who responded before, during, and after the shooting and paint a clearer picture of how Thomas Crooks was able to fire on Trump despite being confronted.\n\n\"F***ing this close, bro, he turned around on me,\" said the officer who was hoisted up onto the American Glass Research building where Crooks was stationed.\n\nNew revelations in the body cam footage\n\nThe footage, of which some of the audio was redacted, shows a police officer running toward the building at 6:10 p.m., just one minute before Trump was shot. Moments later, he was hoisted up by another officer and is shown on video peeking over the roof for a brief moment before Crooks, who cannot be seen at this point, turned his gun on him.\n\nClinging to the roof and unable to draw his weapon, the officer fell approximately 8 feet down and sprained his ankle. Seconds later, at 6:11, Crooks opened fire. All of the audio from the officer's body camera before 6:12 was redacted.\n\nAfter the officer fell from the roof, he can be seen on video sprinting to warn other police officers. He asked, \"Who's got eyes on him?\" and helped a team of officers carrying rifles, who were attempting to scale the wrong part of the building, to locate Crooks. He alerted others that the shooter had a \"full kit,\" long hair, glasses, and a bag and that he was \"laying down, prone out\" on the roof.\n\nNone of the officers on the ground appeared to be aware that Crooks was killed seconds after he fired on Trump and the rallygoers. Minutes after the shooting, an officer who spotted a deceased Crooks on the roof shouted, \"Hold, hold, hold, he's got a f***ing gun.\"\n\nEventually, the officer who confronted Crooks made it to the roof with backup, and the footage shows the shooter dead on the metal roof with a stream of blood that spanned from the peak of the roof's slope in the middle of the building to the edge.\n\nIn other footage, four officers can be seen carrying a body covered in blood to a white tent. The reactions of numerous rallygoers were also captured on video, including several who claimed to have seen the shooter die from counter-sniper fire.\n\n\"I seen his head pop off,\" one person said. Another chimed in, saying, \"He's dead.\"\n\nOne rallygoer can be heard questioning how Crooks made it up to the roof unnoticed because \"they got snipers on the roof.\"\n\nIn the footage, officers can be heard speculating about how Crooks scaled the roof of the AGR building. One officer asked about a ladder, while another suggested that he used a wooden plank propped up near a pallet and a plastic shed.\n\nCrooks's body was found in possession of a \"bloodied receipt\" for a five-foot ladder, but the FBI does not believe he used it to carry out the attack.\n\n'Can you imagine': Local police may have saved Trump's life\n\nThe officer who confronted Crooks and the officer who hoisted him up onto the building may have actually saved Trump's life by buying him the few seconds he needed to \"miraculously\" turn his head, according to Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe.\n\n\"Can you imagine 10 seconds before that?\" Slupe said. \"That the president was looking straight ahead and where that bullet could have potentially landed.\"\n\nThe Butler County Sheriff defended the officer from criticism that he didn't do more to stop Crooks, who was just 130 yards away from the former president. He framed it as a decision between \"I'm dead or I drop\" -- either way, the officer wasn't going to be able to stop the shooter.\n\n\"When someone points a gun at you and you can't get to your weapon, you tell them a**holes online that they are Superman,\" Slupe said. \"Like, 'I'll just pull a gun out and they can shoot at me. I don't give a s***.' Yeah. Mm-hm. Right, right.\"\n\nCrooks went to shooting range one day before rally: New report\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who was the first to release body cam footage to the public on July 25, released 46 pages of documents about Crooks's membership at the Clairton Sportsmen's Club, a local gun club.\n\nGrassley's report, which his staff shared with the Washington Examiner, shows that Crooks established membership at the club on Aug. 10, 2023, less than a year before the attempted assassination. He visited the range 43 times and signed in for target practice 20 times in his first four months of membership. In 2024, he attended target practice approximately once a week on average.\n\nCrooks's final visit to the shooting range was at 2:45 p.m. on July 12, just one day before he opened fire on Trump using a DPMS AR-15 rifle that his father purchased.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhile records show Crooks practiced on the rifle range more frequently than the pistol range, spending about 80% of his time at the gun club practicing his rifle shooting, he focused almost exclusively on the rifle range in 2024.\n\nThe report additionally reveals that Crooks has spent some holidays at the range, including Christmas Day, Valentine's Day, and Halloween, and that Clairton Sportsmen's Club was used by Department of Homeland Security officers for \"police training\" on May 23.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_cordi@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Peter Cordi", "type":

We couldn't find him,\" an officer can be heard saying.\n\n\"Before you motherf**kers came up here, I popped my head up like an idiot by myself, dude,\" said the officer boosted onto the roof.\n\n\"Then he turned around and I f**king dropped...I was calling out, 'Bro f**king on top of the room.'\n\n\"F**king, we're not on the same frequency?\"\n\nThe Butler Township Police Department released a statement that the officer couldn't draw his gun because he was hanging from the building.\n\nThe footage also shows Crooks as officers surrounded his body after he was taken out by counter snipers.\n\nIn another bodycam video, officers appeared confused about why the roof where Crooks shot from was unmanned.\n\n\"I thought you were on the roof?\" said one officer.\n\nThere also appeared to be confusion about whether Crooks had been neutralized and why he wasn't taken out before opening fire.\n\n\"If you'd all had a gun up there ... I'd have shot him,\" one officer can be heard saying.\n\n\"He wouldn't have ripped out a gun up there,\" one officer says in the bodycam.\"\n\nASSASSIN'S OBSESSION\n\nCrooks spent a lot of time at a nearby gun club and took up sharpshooting as his hobby before attempting to kill Trump.\n\nPrior to the alleged assassination try, records obtained by Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley reveal that he visited the shooting range 43 times and engaged in target practice three to six times per month for nearly a year.\n\nThe Clairton Sportsmen's Club turned over logs revealing the countless times Crooks practiced sharpshooting before July 13.\n\nCrooks spent most of his time at the range practicing with long guns instead of handguns, according to the records.\n\nHe would even spend major holidays such as Christmas and Halloween at the club in Clairton, Pennsylvania.\n\nCrooks' membership renewal card listed his occupation as a dietary aide at a nursing home.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray shared several details with Congress of the attack on Trump, including Crook's last visit to the shooting range, which was at 2:45 pm on July 12 - the day before the shooting.\n\nWray couldn't say if Crooks carried the gun to the rooftop or if he had it stashed away ahead of time.\n\nHe added that Crooks and his family owned about 14 guns and the AR-15 he used in the attack was purchased legally by his father and sold to him in October 2023.\n\nCrooks didn't use social media often and was a registered Republican but donated to a progressive group that supported President Joe Biden in 2021.\n\nA social media account possibly belonging to Crooks was discovered by the FBI recently with officials hoping that it could shed light on the motive behind the attack.\n\nA STEP BEHIND\n\nCounter snipers were aware of Crooks' presence for more than 100 minutes before the shooting, according to an inquiry into the incident.\n\nText messages between three Secret Service agents show that Crooks was on the agency's radar after he was spotted sitting at a picnic table.\n\n\"Guys I am out. Be safe,\" the Secret Service member wrote in a message to the group.\n\n\"Someone followed our lead and snuck in and parked by our cars just so you know.\"\n\n\"I'm just letting you know because you see me go out with my rifle and put it in my car so he knows you guys are up there,\" they added at 4:27 pm, 104 minutes before the shooting at 6:11 pm.\n\n\"He's sitting to the direct right on a picnic table about 50 yards from the exit.\"\n\n\"Roger that\" said another counter sniper as the third responded with a thumbs-up emoji.\n\nAnother message was sent in the group chat at 5:38 pm, warning that Crooks had moved from the picnic table and was scoping the building that he would later climb.\n\n\"Kid leaning around building we are in,\" the message read alongside photos of Crooks.\n\n\"I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out. I lost sight of him.\"\n\n\"Also a bike with backpack sitting next to it in rear of building that was not seen earlier,\" the counter sniper added.\n\nAt 5:40, one of the snipers told them to call in the report of the gunman and investigate the situation.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\u2013style_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AR-15\u2013style rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shooting range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Matthew Pearson, the acting chief of the Butler Township Police Department, shared the bodycam footage with the Washington Examiner. The videos show the experiences of several officers who responded before, during, and after the shooting and paint a clearer picture of how Thomas Crooks was able to fire on Trump despite being confronted.\n\n\"F***ing this close, bro, he turned around on me,\" said the officer who was hoisted up onto the American Glass Research building where Crooks was stationed.\n\nThe footage, of which some of the audio was redacted, shows a police officer running toward the building at 6:10 p.m., just one minute before Trump was shot. Moments later, he was hoisted up by another officer and is shown on video peeking over the roof for a brief moment before Crooks, who cannot be seen at this point, turned his gun on him.\n\nClinging to the roof and unable to draw his weapon, the officer fell approximately 8 feet down and sprained his ankle. Seconds later, at 6:11, Crooks opened fire. All of the audio from the officer's body camera before 6:12 was redacted.\n\nAfter the officer fell from the roof, he can be seen on video sprinting to warn other police officers. He asked, \"Who's got eyes on him?\" and helped a team of officers carrying rifles, who were attempting to scale the wrong part of the building, to locate Crooks. He alerted others that the shooter had a \"full kit,\" long hair, glasses, and a bag and that he was \"laying down, prone out\" on the roof.\n\nNone of the officers on the ground appeared to be aware that Crooks was killed seconds after he fired on Trump and the rallygoers. Minutes after the shooting, an officer who spotted a deceased Crooks on the roof shouted, \"Hold, hold, hold, he's got a f***ing gun.\"\n\nEventually, the officer who confronted Crooks made it to the roof with backup, and the footage shows the shooter dead on the metal roof with a stream of blood that spanned from the peak of the roof's slope in the middle of the building to the edge.\n\nIn other footage, four officers can be seen carrying a body covered in blood to a white tent. The reactions of numerous rallygoers were also captured on video, including several who claimed to have seen the shooter die from counter-sniper fire.\n\n\"I seen his head pop off,\" one person said. Another chimed in, saying, \"He's dead.\"\n\nOne rallygoer can be heard questioning how Crooks made it up to the roof unnoticed because \"they got snipers on the roof.\"\n\nIn the footage, officers can be heard speculating about how Crooks scaled the roof of the AGR building. One officer asked about a ladder, while another suggested that he used a wooden plank propped up near a pallet and a plastic shed.\n\nCrooks's body was found in possession of a \"bloodied receipt\" for a five-foot ladder, but the FBI does not believe he used it to carry out the attack.\n\nThe officer who confronted Crooks and the officer who hoisted him up onto the building may have actually saved Trump's life by buying him the few seconds he needed to \"miraculously\" turn his head, according to Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe.\n\n\"Can you imagine 10 seconds before that?\" Slupe said. \"That the president was looking straight ahead and where that bullet could have potentially landed.\"\n\nThe Butler County Sheriff defended the officer from criticism that he didn't do more to stop Crooks, who was just 130 yards away from the former president. He framed it as a decision between \"I'm dead or I drop\" -- either way, the officer wasn't going to be able to stop the shooter.\n\n\"When someone points a gun at you and you can't get to your weapon, you tell them a**holes online that they are Superman,\" Slupe said. \"Like, 'I'll just pull a gun out and they can shoot at me. I don't give a s***.' Yeah. Mm-hm. Right, right.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who was the first to release bodycam footage to the public on July 25, released 46 pages of documents about Crooks's membership at the Clairton Sportsmen's Club, a local gun club.\n\nGrassley's report, which his staff shared with the Washington Examiner, shows that Crooks established membership at the club on Aug. 10, 2023, less than a year before the attempted assassination. He visited the range 43 times and signed in for target practice 20 times in his first four months of membership. In 2024, he attended target practice approximately once a week on average.\n\nCrooks's final visit to the shooting range was at 2:45 p.m. on July 12, just one day before he opened fire on Trump using a DPMS AR-15 rifle that his father purchased.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhile records show Crooks practiced on the rifle range more frequently than the pistol range, spending about 80% of his time at the gun club practicing his rifle shooting, he focused almost exclusively on the rifle range in 2024.\n\nThe report additionally reveals that Crooks has spent some holidays at the range, including Christmas Day, Valentine's Day, and Halloween, and that Clairton Sportsmen's Club was used by Department of Homeland Security officers for \"police training\" on May 23.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_cordi@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Peter Cordi", "type":

I told them that f---ing Tuesday,\" the officer can be heard telling a colleague.\n\nThe video, one of 12 provided to The Washington Post in response to a records request, shows the confusion and frustration among law enforcement in the aftermath of the shooting, underscoring a key question at the core of multiple investigations into the Secret Service's most serious security failure in decades: Why didn't anyone secure the roof of a building so close to the rally site?\n\n\"Why weren't we on the roof?\" an officer in one of the videos asks a colleague. Another officer responds that \"the Secret Service guys, they were like, 'yeah, no problem, we're gonna post guys over here.'\"\n\nA spokesman for the Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nTrump rally shooting\n\nThe Washington Post built a 3D model of the site of the attempted assassination at a Donald Trump rally in Pennsylvania based on more than 40 videos and photos. The Post's analysis found that two Secret Service countersniper teams may not have been able to see the shooter at first.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nThe footage is from body cameras worn by police officers for Butler Township, one of several law enforcement agencies asked to help the Secret Service secure the July 13 rally. Officials have said Crooks fired eight shots that day, wounding Trump, killing one rallygoer and critically injuring two others.\n\nThe videos also show a moment that has become a defining illustration of the communication gaps between local and federal law enforcement that day.\n\nThey capture an officer being hoisted onto the roof of the Agr International building, where he glimpsed Crooks with a gun a half-minute before he opened fire. Seconds after peeking over the edge of the roof, the officer drops down and retreats to the building's parking lot, the video shows.\n\nThe officer radioed to a local command post that Crooks was armed with a rifle, but that message never made it to the Secret Service command center or agency's personnel closest to Trump, The Post previously reported.\n\nLocal officials have previously said that the officer dropped down from the roof because Crooks pointed his rifle at him and that the officer could not quickly access his gun because he was using his hands to hold himself up.\n\n\"F---in' this close, bro,\" the officer says to a colleague while taking cover in the parking lot, pinching his fingers in the air. \"Dude, he turned around on me.\"\n\nCrooks is not visible in the rooftop video. But later, after Crooks was killed, the officer explains that he had alerted others on a police radio channel and asks his colleagues if they had access to that channel.\n\n\"That's what I was calling out, bro,\" the officer says while standing with other law enforcement officials on the roof next to Crooks' body. \"F----- on top of the roof. Are you all on the same frequency?\"\n\nOn the day of the rally, local snipers were assigned to observe the crowd from two windows on the second story of the Agr International building, but no one was on the rooftop of the adjoining building that Crooks used as his perch.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the shooting, some officers appeared baffled by how that could have happened.\n\n\"I thought you guys were on the roof,\" an officer says to another in one of the videos.\n\n\"No, we're inside,\" another responds.\n\n\"I'd say this is a f--- up,\" an officer says in another video. \"Someone f---ed up.\"\n\n\"There wasn't anyone on the roof,\" a colleague answers. \"The stage is right there.\"\n\nLater in the same video, one of the officers says that when he saw someone on the roof, \"they probably should have yanked Trump right off the stage.\"\n\n\"I called it,\" he says, an apparent reference to a radio transmission. \"It isn't my fault.\"\n\nThe videos, only some of which have audio, also capture local officers' frantic search for Crooks in the minutes before the shooting. The Post did not identify Crooks in any of the videos.\n\nOfficers can be seen responding to the Agr International building, circling its perimeter and gesturing toward the roof. After the shooting, some express their frustration.\n\n\"I'm f---ing pissed,\" an officer says in a recording after Crooks was killed. \"We couldn't find him.\"\n\nEvan Hill, Jarrett Ley and Samuel Oakford contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_swaine@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Jon Swaine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carousel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carousel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3D film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Command and control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/08-08-2024/t_57277b5701724cb79ed3fd60964a99ed_name_2024AUG08_PoliceBodyCamera_SecretService.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1660, "textEnd": 1667}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

(TND) -- Local police are expected to release newly body camera footage showing an encounter between the Donald Trump shooter and a police officer.\n\nButler Township Police Department confirmed over the phone that footage recorded on July 13 will show an encounter between one of its officers confronting Thomas Matthew Crooks moments before the shooting rampage.\n\nIn a report by KDKA, Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe told the media outlet that an armed municipal officer with Butler Township encountered Crooks before he fired shots from a rooftop building.\n\nCrooks opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Federal investigators said the shooting was an assassination attempt on the former president. A bullet from Crook's AR-15 rifle injured Trump who was speaking to a large crowd. Rally attendees were also shot.Corey Comperatore died from gunshot wounds. Rallygoers,David Dutch andJames Copenhaver, were shot and injured.\n\nThe footage is expected to be released to the public on Thursday. It'll be the latest evidence to shed light on the moments before Crooks opened fire.\n\nInvestigators are still trying to learn more about the motive in the shooting. FBI deputy director, Paul Abbate, shared a possible motive with lawmakers last month. Abbate told lawmakers Crooks' social media postings between 2019 and 2020 revealedantisemitic and anti-immigration themes.\n\nSen.

Dude, he turned around on me,\" the officer who was hoisted can be heard saying later on in bodycam video released Thursday.\n\nOne officer can be seen hoisting another officer onto the roof where Crooks was stationed, which is about 12 feet above the ground.\n\nPAKISTANI MAN WITH TIES TO IRAN CHARGED IN FOILED ASSASSINATION PLOT POTENTIALLY TARGETING TRUMP, DOJ SAYS\n\nCrooks pointed his weapon at the officer who scaled the building, before the officer ultimately ducks his head and loses his grip on the roof's edge and falls about 8 feet to the ground, spraining his ankle, Butler Township Manager Thomas Knights previously told Fox News Digital.\n\nThe footage captures Crooks toward the end as officers surround his body after countersnipers fatally shot him.\n\n\"I'm f -- ing p -- ed. We couldn't find him,\" another officer can be heard saying in the bodycam footage.\n\n\"Before you motherf -- ers came up here, I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself, dude,\" the officer who was boosted onto the roof says. \"Then he turned around and I f -- ing dropped, and I started f -- ing, I was calling out, 'Bro, f -- ing on top of the roof.' F -- ing, we're not on the same frequency?\"\n\n\"F -- ing we're not on the same frequency?\"\n\nButler Township PD Lt. Matthew Pearson told a local outlet that the officer was unable to draw his weapon since he was hanging from the building.\n\nSeconds later, Crooks opened fire and grazed Trump's right ear. Three rallygoers were also shot, including Comperatore, 50, who was killed protecting his family from danger.\n\nAdditional footage from the Butler Township police department shows officers immediately after Crooks was neutralized:\n\nBODYCAM SHOWS PA POLICE RESPONSE TO ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT:\n\nDavid Dutch and James Copenhaver were injured after being shot at the rally. They have both since returned home, and Copenhaver's attorney provided an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital as he continues to recover.\n\nOfficers can be seen standing over Crooks' body on the roof in the footage released Thursday.\n\nIn other bodycam video, officers are clearly confused about why the roof of the American Glass Research (AGR) building, where Crooks shot from, was unmanned.\n\nThere also appears to be confusion about whether the shooter was neutralized and why the shooter wasn't taken out before he opened fire.\n\nPA OFFICERS ASK WHY ROOF CROOKS SHOT FROM WAS UNMANNED\n\n\"If you'd all had a gun up there ... I'd have shot him. He wouldn't have ripped out a gun up there,\" one officer says in the bodycam.\n\n\"I'd say this is a f -- up...somebody f -- ed up.\"\n\nThe footage is the latest crucial piece of publicly available information released that attempts to shed light on exactly what transpired that day and what efforts were put in place to stop Crooks.\n\nThe security breaches that paved the way for the shooting have been muddied by finger-pointing among the various agencies involved at the local, state and federal levels.\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said video of someone moving along a roof minutes before Trump was shot confirms a \"failure.\"\n\nThe video, taken by Copenhaver and exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, shows a figure moving across the roof of the AGR building just minutes before gunfire rang out at Trump's rally.\n\nVIDEO SHOWS TRUMP SHOOTING VICTIM'S POV\n\nThe FBI previously revealed that Crooks had driven to the rally site at 11 a.m. on the day of the shooting and spent an hour there before heading home.\n\nCrooks did not return to the scene until 3:50 p.m. Local law enforcement officers, in their designated positions, spotted him for the first time around 5:10 p.m. -- approximately 50 minutes before Trump took the stage, according to documents obtained by Fox News Digital from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who obtained them from the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit (ESU).\n\nBUTLER POLICE GATHER WITNESSES AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT:\n\nOn his return to the rally site, Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards away from where Trump was going to be speaking, according to the FBI. The FBI later said that no photos or videos were taken from the drone and that the agency found no memory card in the drone.\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: NEW TEXTS SHOW LOCAL POLICE SCRAMBLE TO ASSIST WITH COVERING RALLY\n\nAt 5:30 p.m., local law enforcement snapped a picture of Crooks and escalated it to command.\n\n\"Kid learning around building we are in,\" an officer wrote in a text message, along with an image of Crooks. \"AGR I believe it is. I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out.\"\n\n\"I lost sight of him,\" the officer added.\n\nA follow-up message said: \"Call it in to command and have a uniform check it out.\"\n\nOn the day of the rally, Crooks parked his vehicle and flew a drone between about 3:50 p.m. and 4 p.m. about 200 yards from where the former president would be speaking on July 13. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified during a July 17 congressional hearing that Crooks had been at the rally site for about 70 minutes the morning of the assassination attempt.\n\nFox News Digital is reviewing the bodycam footage.

He was then killed by a Secret Service sniper.\n\nThe incident injured the Republican presidential candidate, killed 50-year-old volunteer firefighter Corey Comperatore and left two others critically injured.\n\nWhen audio was later picked up on the bodycam, the officer who saw Crooks could be heard shouting \"he's straight up\" and asking \"who has eyes on him\".\n\n\"He was right where you picked me up bro\", he continued.\n\n\"He was on that left side.\"\n\nAt one point after the shots were fired, the officer could be heard shouting \"don't pull up your head, he's right there\" to other law enforcement officers.\n\nConversation that could be heard over the radio included an officer saying: \"We have two civilians - tending to them. I need an ambulance in the back.\"\n\nNear the end of the footage, armed officers are seen scaling the building.\n\nThe footage then cuts to a clip showing the scene on the roof after Crooks was shot dead. His body is seen lying on the roof next to a rifle and a blood trail.\n\nThe new footage was released after CNN submitted a public record request to Butler Township Police and appealed when they initially refused to release video involving officers or personnel related to the shooting at the rally.\n\nSecret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency was reviewing the footage, CNN reported.\n\n\"The US Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,\" he said.\n\n\"The attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump was a US Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\"\n\nAbout two hours before the shooting, Crooks flew a drone over the area about 180 metres from the stage where Trump spoke to the crowd, and live-streamed footage for about 11 minutes.\n\nCrude explosive devices were later recovered from Crooks's car and home. They were designed to be detonated remotely. Crooks had a transmitter with him.\n\nThe FBI believes he would not have been successful had he tried to detonate the devices.\n\nFBI director Christopher Wray last month said Crooks, 20, searched online for information on the John F Kennedy assassination.\n\n\"Analysis of a laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter reveals that on July 6, he did a Google search for -- quote -- 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy','\" Mr Wray told a US House Judiciary Committee.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald assassinated former president Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.\n\nKimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the Secret Service on July 24, after coming under scrutiny following the assassination attempt.\n\nShe had told a US congressional oversight hearing that the incident was the agency's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades, adding that she took \"full responsibility\".", "source": {"uri": "home.nzcity.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZCity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Garth Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director of the United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Crooks fired from an unsecured rooftop about 500 feet from the former president. Trump turned his head just in time to avoid a significant injury.\n\nSecret Service officials have admitted a \"failure\" in the shooting and making sure the area was secure. On Thursday, investigators released new body camera footage showing Butler County police confronting Crooks moments before the shooting, but unable to stop him before he shot at the rally.\n\nSome of the footage shows the local officer being hoisted up onto the roof by another cop and then quickly dropping down again after he spots the shooter. The released footage was muted so no audio could be heard.\n\nThe officer later revealed to his fellow cops that Crooks pointed the gun at him before he hopped down and ran towards his car, eventually getting a rifle.\n\nAbout 40 seconds after the encounter, Crooks turned back towards Trump, firing eight shots and striking Trump in the ear. Crooks was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper seconds later.\n\n\"F****** this close bro. Dude, he turned around on me,\" the officer who spotted Crooks tells a fellow officer.\n\nWhen one officer asks where the shooter is located, the officer says \"He's straight up.\"\n\n\"Who's got eyes on him? He was right where you picked me up, bro. He was on that left side,\" the officer says.\n\nA voice can then be heard coming from a radio, saying \"We have two civilians - tending to them. I need an ambulance in the back.\"\n\nAnother video shared by Butler police shows one officer telling colleagues shortly after the shooting that he had told the Secret Service to place officers at the building that Crooks used to take aim at Trump.\n\n\"I f****** told them they need to post the guys f****** over here,\" he says. \"I told them that, the f******, the Secret Service, I told them that f******* Tuesday. I told them to post f****** guys over here.\"\n\nOne officer responded, saying that he wasn't \"even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof. I thought that's how we -- how in the hell can you lose a guy walking back here?\"\n\n\"I talked to the Secret Service guys, they were like, 'Yeah, no problem, we're going to post guys over here,'\" the first officer adds in the footage.\n\nAn officer describes via radio a suspicious person who had been lost by law enforcement as \"a gentleman with a flat face that we were looking for earlier. He was creeping people out.\"\n\n\"He was watching people out in the woods by the water tower. I'm not sure he is the gentleman down or not,\" he adds.\n\nShortly after the shooting, another officer arrives at the warehouse and tells a colleague, \"I thought you guys were on the roof. I thought it was you. I thought it was you.\"\n\nThe officer explained that no officers were on the roof.\n\n\"What the f***,\" the first officer says. \"Why were we not on the roof? Why weren't we?\"\n\nFederal officials have said that the Secret Service thought that Butler County Emergency Services Unit snipers would be covering the rooftop from where Crooks took aim. However, a local official previously said that tactical team leaders told the Secret Service their snipers would be inside the building on the second floor.\n\nThe Butler team didn't want snipers on the roof because of the heat exposure. The official added that the sloped roof would have obscured a number of vantage points.\n\nThe Secret Service had limited contact with local police on the day of the rally.\n\nMany politicians and Americans have questioned the Secret Service and the police actions on that day. Former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the wake of the shooting and after her disastrous congressional testimony about the shooting and the federal investigation.\n\nDuring a press conference on Friday, acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe said \"we should have had more of a presence\" at the building, which was just outside of the security perimeter set up ahead of the rally.\n\n\"This was a Secret Service failure,\" he added. \"That roofline should have been covered. We should have had better eyes on that.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Police body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/258bcff70c440a656ded02560075046f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 164, "textEnd": 171, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Investigators have said Crooks fired an AR-style rifle at the former president from the roof of a building less than 150 yards from Trump's stage at the Butler Farm Show grounds July 13.\n\nCrooks signed in for target practice 20 times within the first four months of his membership, the documents showed, and averaged three to six target practices per month throughout 2024.\n\nIn total, Crooks signed in at the range 43 times.\n\nCrooks spent about 80% of his time at the gun club on rifle practice, according to the records.\n\nAttendance logs show Crooks never brought a guest with him to the range, even when he spent holidays there.

Seconds later, a Secret Service counter sniper shoots and kills Crooks.\n\nHowever, the bodycam audio does not turn on until halfway through.\n\n\"He's got glasses, long hair,\" the officer says, describing Crooks's backpack and the AR-15 rifle he was carrying.\n\nAfter the tense encounter, the officer runs around to another side of the building before running to his police vehicle to retrieve a rifle. The officer then grabs his radio to request an immediate ambulance to the rally's VIP tent.\n\nAfter minutes go by, the officers surrounding the building receive different orders and they begin helping each other up onto the roof.\n\nThe officer who first looked over the top then requests to go back on the roof, and it shows 20-year-old Crooks lying dead with a trail of his blood pouring down the rooftop's slope.\n\nThe ledge that the first officer climbed was close to 12-feet off the ground. After going into shock and climbing back down, he began to fall at around 8-feet and sprained his ankle. His shock was prompted by Crooks pointing his gun at him.\n\nAs a result, the officer was not able to draw his gun on Crooks since both of his hands were pinned as he tried to pull himself up on the roof, according to Butler Township Police Lt. Matthew Pearson, which is also shown in his bodycam footage.\n\nTowards the end of the footage, it is made apparent that the officer is visibly angry and frustrated that authorities were not communicating on the same radio channels as him and his back up.\n\n\"Before you motherf*****s came up here, I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself dude,\" he says, \"Then he turned around and I f***** dropped and I started f***** I was calling out bro, f***** on top of the roof.\"\n\n\"F***** we're not on the same frequency?\"\n\nIn another video released by Butler Police, one officer is heard yelling at his fellow officers, telling them that he had told Secret Service to post authorities by the building that Crooks was firing from.\n\n\"I f**king told them they need to post the guys f**king over here,\" the officer said. \"I told them that, the f**king, the Secret Service, I told them that f**king Tuesday. I told them to post f**king guys over here.\"\n\nAnother officer replied that he wasn't \"even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof.

Trump, struggling to reach the attacker before he shot at Mr. Trump, newly released police videos and a social media video show.\n\nThe body-cam and dashcam footage, paired with an eyewitness video posted on YouTube, provide new insight into the presence of and the response by Pennsylvania law enforcement at the building where the gunman, Thomas Crooks, was positioned. They reveal for the first time the critical moments -- starting around 6:08 p.m. -- when officers establish Mr. Crooks's location, frantically try to find a way to get onto the roof and determine that he is armed. By around 6:11, Mr. Crooks opens fire.\n\nBefore the release of the videos, the exact movements of nearby law enforcement officers -- and the actions they took to address a newly identified threat -- were unclear. Testimony from state police and Secret Service officials provided some details, but the footage obtained by The New York Times through a public records request gives the first second-by-second retelling from the perspectives of two of the officers near the gunman at the time of the shooting.\n\nThe footage also raises more questions as to why the Secret Service failed to remove Mr. Trump from the stage in Butler, Pa., on July 13, while local law enforcement officers were scrambling to get to Mr. Crooks, even if they weren't yet aware that he had a firearm.\n\nThe footage analyzed by The Times includes 12 videos released on Thursday by the Butler Township Police Department, showing at least three Butler officers and one Pennsylvania state trooper focused on the roof from where Mr. Crooks fired. Eyewitness footage previously published on YouTube shows that a fifth law enforcement officer was also responding in the same area.\n\nThe earliest body-cam video captured near the complex of warehouse buildings, owned by AGR International, begins seven minutes before the shooting.\n\nAt first, some officers appear to be responding to reports, documented in text messages and an after-action report obtained by The Times, that a suspicious person is moving away from the rally.\n\nAn officer is seen searching in the nearby woods at 6:04 p.m. While the officer is surveying this area, Mr. Crooks is about 270 yards away, scaling a building at the opposite end of the complex. At 6:08 p.m. the body camera of the officer captures Mr. Crooks walking on the roof of one of the buildings, which are connected by catwalks. It's unclear if the officer sees Mr. Crooks.\n\nAnother officer arrives at the scene in his vehicle at 6:09 p.m. At this point, videos show five officers scattered near the building from which Mr. Crooks would later fire. The state trooper stands on a picnic table to look for the suspicious person on the roof while bystanders look on.\n\nThen, four officers congregate on the east side of the building.\n\nThere, the officer who has just arrived by car is hoisted up so he can see onto the roof. According to previous testimony by Col. Christopher Paris of the state police, the officer made eye contact with the gunman, but dropped back to the ground when Mr. Crooks pointed the gun at him.\n\nHe then communicated over the radio that Mr. Crooks had a gun, according to testimony last week from Ronald Rowe Jr., the acting Secret Service director. Mr. Rowe added that the radio message had never made it to the Secret Service.\n\nVideo shows the officer running back around the building.\n\nAbout 40 seconds after the officer sees him over the side of the building, at 6:11 p.m., Mr. Crooks fires. The officer flinches and retreats from the building as a Pennsylvania state trooper is seen pointing a rifle at the roof. Mr. Crooks is shot by a Secret Service sniper shortly after.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, law enforcement are seen still scrambling to gain access to the roof, shouting for a ladder. In a body-cam video that had audio enabled, the officer who had made eye contact with Mr. Crooks describes the shooter's appearance, warning the other officers to \"watch out because he can [expletive] come right down on you over there\" -- apparently not yet sure that Mr. Crooks has been killed.\n\nTen minutes after the shooting, the cameras capture multiple officers on the roof next to Mr. Crooks's body, visibly distraught by their inability to stop the shooting.\n\n\"What are the chances, what are the [expletive] chances,\" says one officer. At the same time, outside the building, another officer says that he warned the Secret Service to guard the area days earlier. \"I told them to post [expletive] guys over here.\"\n\nOn another camera, an officer said in frustration, \"We were watching him.\"\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, a Secret Service spokesperson, said the agency was reviewing the body-cam footage and called the attempted assassination a \"Secret Service failure.\"\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,\" Mr. Guglielmi said. \"We are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dashcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/New-Footage-From-the-Trump-Assassination-Attempt-Shows-a-Frantic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1425, "textEnd": 1432}], "sentiment": -0.403921568627451, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The footage does show the moments where the officer in question was hoisted up onto the roof with the assistance of another officer, momentarily confronted Crooks, then dropped back to the ground.\n\nThe footage is taken from two officers from the Butler Township Police Department who made a desperate attempt to stop Crooks moments before he fired his DPMS AR-15 rifle striking former President Trump in the ear, killing Corey Comparatore and injuring two others.\n\n\"F------ this close, bro. Dude he turned around on me,\" the officer who was hoisted can be heard saying later on in bodycam video released Thursday.\n\n...\n\nCrooks pointed his weapon at the officer who scaled the building, before he ultimately ducks his head and loses his grip on the roof's edge and falls about eight feet to the ground, spraining his ankle, Butler Township Manager Thomas Knights previously told Fox News Digital.\n\nLater footage from after Crooks was taken down by a Secret Service sniper also reflects the officers' frustration at not being able to locate him sooner and not being able to adequately communicate the threat to others.\n\nThe captures Crooks toward the end as officers surround his body after countersnipers fatally shot him.\n\n\"I'm f------ p---ed. We couldn't find him,\" another officer can be heard saying in the bodycam footage.\n\n\"Before you motherf-----s came up here, I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself dude,\" the officer who was boosted onto the roof says. \"Then he turned around and I f------ dropped and I started f------ I was calling out bro, f------ on top of the roof. F------ we're not on the same frequency?\"\n\nNew Police Transcript Reveals Chaos As Authorities Lost Track of Trump Shooter for 20 Minutes\n\nTrump Assassination Attempt: Local SWAT Team Blames Lack of Planning, Communication\n\nAccording to Fox, additional footage further reveals confusion among law enforcement, but again, without audio available to the viewer.\n\nIn other bodycam video, officers are clearly confused about why the roof of the American Glass Research (AGR) building, where Crooks shot from, was unmanned.\n\n\"I thought you were on the roof?\" one officer says.\n\n...\n\n\"Why were we not on the roof...why weren't we?\"\n\n...\n\nThere also appears to be confusion about whether the shooter was neutralized and the shooter wasn't taken out before he opened fire.\n\n\"If you'd all had a gun up there ... I'd have shot him.

A countersniper stationed on a nearby roof swiftly killed Crooks with a single bullet to the head.\n\nTRUMP SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT\n\n\"I f -- ing told them they need to post the guys f -- ing over here. I told them,\" a police officer can be heard saying minutes after the attempted assassination. \"The Secret Service. I told them that f -- ing Tuesday.\"\n\nAnother person can be heard off camera saying he thought the man speaking had been posted on the roof.\n\n\"No, we were inside,\" the local officer replied.\n\nSecret Service leadership has yet to adequately explain why no one was stationed on the roof, which had a direct line of sight to the president, but the footage suggests a complete breakdown in communication.\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: TEXTS REVEAL OFFICERS WERE AWARE OF THOMAS CROOKS 90 MINUTES BEFORE SHOOTING\n\n\"This reinforces that this was very badly organized, and that's irrefutable, and that comes down to the Service,\" former NYPD Inspector Paul Mauro told Fox News Digital.\n\nAn officer can be seen hoisting a colleague onto the roof where Crooks was positioned with an AR-15 rifle. The shooter pointed the weapon at the officer, forcing him to duck and lose his balance while hanging from the side of the building.\n\nSeconds later, Crooks opened fire, striking Trump in the ear and killing former firefighter Corey Comperatore.\n\n\"F -- , this close bro, dude - he turned around on me,\" the officer who came face-to-face with Crooks can be heard saying on the footage.\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT VICTIM DAVID DUTCH SPEAKS OUT FOR FIRST TIME SINCE HOSPITAL RELEASE\n\nThe video shows the officer scrambling to retrieve a large gun from his car and then joining a swarm of other law enforcement agents who begin surrounding the building.\n\nThe officer describes Crooks to the others as they prepare to ascend to the roof, telling them that he has glasses and long hair. He adds that Crooks has a long gun and several magazines.\n\n\"Watch out,\" he tells them, \"because he can come down right on top of you over there.\"\n\nBut Crooks was already dead. Later in the footage, Crooks' lifeless body is seen surrounded by officers.\n\nFORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT WARNS AGENCY 'STRETCHED THIN' WITH NEW RESPONSIBILITIES, LACK OF MANPOWER\n\nSeveral attendees said they repeatedly warned officers at the scene of Crooks' presence.\n\nPolice first took note of Crooks at 5:10 p.m., roughly 50 minutes before he shot at Trump. Local law enforcement took a picture of Crooks at 5:30 p.m. and alerted their superiors. But police lost sight of him.\n\n\"I'm f -- ing p -- ed. We couldn't find him,\" another officer is heard saying in the bodycam footage.\n\nMauro said the Butler Township Police officers who spotted Crooks on the roof were on traffic duty at the event yet realized the seriousness of the situation and abandoned their posts.\n\n\"You can see the level of confusion,\" he said.\n\nAfter the officer's confrontation with Crooks, he relays to the other law enforcement officials his frustration.\n\n\"Before you motherf -- ers came up here, I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself, dude,\" the officer who was boosted onto the roof says. \"Then he (Crooks) turned around, and I f -- ing dropped, and I started f -- ing ... I was calling out, 'Bro, f -- ing on top of the roof.' F -- ing, we're not on the same frequency?\"\n\nSECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR: TRUMP RALLY SHOOTER WAS IDENTIFIED AS 'POTENTIAL PERSON OF SUSPICION'\n\nThe comment suggests that the local police were not on the same radio frequency as the other law enforcement agencies, including the Secret Service, or their equipment wasn't working properly, Mauro said.\n\nWhen the officer tried to warn the Secret Service that Crooks had a gun, the message didn't get through.\n\n\"The video confirms the speculation that the communications were a mess, and it's undeniable,\" Mauro said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSpotty cell service further hampered the team's ability to communicate in the midst of a rapidly unfolding crisis.\n\nShortly after the shooting, an officer can be heard on video summarizing the jarring lapse.\n\n\"I'd say this is a f -- up ... somebody f -- ed up,\" he says.\n\nFox News' Audrey Conkin, Michael Dorgan and Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\u2013style_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AR-15\u2013style rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://wfin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WFIN-AM-FM-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 593, "textEnd": 600}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Crooks fired from an unsecured rooftop about 500 feet from the former president. Trump turned his head just in time to avoid a significant injury.\n\nSecret Service officials have admitted a \"failure\" in the shooting and making sure the area was secure. On Thursday, investigators released new body camera footage showing Butler County police confronting Crooks moments before the shooting, but unable to stop in before he shot at the rally.\n\nSome of the footage shows the local officer shows him being hoisted up onto the roof by another cops and then quickly dropping down again after he spots the shooter. The released footage was muted so no audio could be heard.\n\nThe officer later revealed to his fellow cops that Crooks pointed the gun at him before he hopped down and ran towards his car, eventually getting a rifle.\n\nAbout 40 seconds after the encounter, Crooks turned back towards Trump, firing eight shots and striking Trump in the ear. Crooks was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper seconds later.\n\n\"F****** this close bro. Dude, he turned around on me,\" the officer who spotted Crooks tells a fellow officer.\n\nWhen one officer asks where the shooter is located, the officer says \"He's straight up.\"\n\n\"Who's got eyes on him? He was right where you picked me up, bro. He was on that left side,\" the officer says.\n\nA voice can then be heard coming from a radio, saying \"We have two civilians - tending to them. I need an ambulance in the back.\"\n\nAnother video shared by Butler police shows one officer telling colleagues shortly after the shooting that he had told the Secret Service to place officers at the building that Crooks used to take aim at Trump.\n\n\"I f****** told them they need to post the guys f****** over here,\" he says. \"I told them that, the f******, the Secret Service, I told them that f******* Tuesday. I told them to post f****** guys over here.\"\n\nOne officer responded, saying that he wasn't \"even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof. I thought that's how we -- how in the hell can you lose a guy walking back here?\"\n\n\"I talked to the Secret Service guys, they were like, 'Yeah, no problem, we're going to post guys over here,'\" the first officer adds in the footage.\n\nAn officer describes via radio a suspicious person who had been lost by law enforcement as \"a gentleman with a flat face that we were looking for earlier. He was creeping people out.\"\n\n\"He was watching people out in the woods by the water tower. I'm not sure he is the gentleman down or not,\" he adds.\n\nShortly after the shooting, another officer arrives at the warehouse and tells a colleague, \"I thought you guys were on the roof. I thought it was you. I thought it was you.\"\n\nThe officer explained that no officers were on the roof.\n\n\"What the f***,\" the first officer says. \"Why were we not on the roof? Why weren't we?\"\n\nFederal officials have said that the Secret Service thought that Butler County Emergency Services Unit snipers would be covering the rooftop from where Crooks took aim. However, a local official previously said that tactical team leaders told the Secret Service their snipers would be inside the building on the second floor.\n\nThe Butler team didn't want snipers on the roof because of the heat exposure. The official added that the sloped roof would have obscured a number of vantage points.\n\nThe Secret Service had limited contact with local police on the day of the rally.\n\nMany politicians and Americans have questioned the Secret Service and the police actions on that day. Former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the wake of the shooting and after her disastrous congressional testimony about the shooting and the federal investigation.\n\nDuring a press conference on Friday, acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe said \"we should have had more of a presence\" at the building, which was just outside of the security perimeter set up ahead of the rally.\n\n\"This was a Secret Service failure,\" he added. \"That roofline should have been covered.

Later in the footage, Crooks' lifeless body is seen surrounded by officers.\n\nFORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT WARNS AGENCY 'STRETCHED THIN' WITH NEW RESPONSIBILITIES, LACK OF MANPOWER\n\nSeveral attendees said they repeatedly warned officers at the scene of Crooks' presence.\n\nPolice first took note of Crooks at 5:10 p.m., roughly 50 minutes before he shot at Trump. Local law enforcement took a picture of Crooks at 5:30 p.m. and alerted their superiors. But police lost sight of him.\n\n\"I'm f---ing p---ed. We couldn't find him,\" another officer is heard saying in the bodycam footage.\n\nMauro said the Butler Township Police officers who spotted Crooks on the roof were on traffic duty at the event yet realized the seriousness of the situation and abandoned their posts.\n\n\"You can see the level of confusion,\" he said.\n\nAfter the officer's confrontation with Crooks, he relays to the other law enforcement officials his frustration.\n\n\"Before you motherf---ers came up here, I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself, dude,\" the officer who was boosted onto the roof says. \"Then he (Crooks) turned around, and I f---ing dropped, and I started f---ing ... I was calling out, 'Bro, f---ing on top of the roof.' F---ing, we're not on the same frequency?\"\n\nSECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR: TRUMP RALLY SHOOTER WAS IDENTIFIED AS 'POTENTIAL PERSON OF SUSPICION'\n\nThe comment suggests that the local police were not on the same radio frequency as the other law enforcement agencies, including the Secret Service, or their equipment wasn't working properly, Mauro said.\n\nWhen the officer tried to warn the Secret Service that Crooks had a gun, the message didn't get through.\n\n\"The video confirms the speculation that the communications were a mess, and it's undeniable,\" Mauro said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSpotty cell service further hampered the team's ability to communicate in the midst of a rapidly unfolding crisis.\n\nShortly after the shooting, an officer can be heard on video summarizing the jarring lapse.\n\n\"I'd say this is a f---up ... somebody f---ed up,\" he says.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_rosenberg@foxnews.com", "name": "Rebecca Rosenberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\u2013style_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AR-15\u2013style rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_gun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long gun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/1024/512/Bodycam-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 593, "textEnd": 600}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Tragically, the incident resulted in the death of one individual and injuries to two others.\n\nThe video footage shows two Butler Township Police Department officers, who were hoisted onto a rooftop approximately 12 feet high, frantically attempting to intervene as Crooks positioned himself to execute the attack.\n\nCrooks, armed with a DPMS AR-15 rifle, aimed his weapon at one of the officers as they scaled the structure. In a heart-stopping moment, one of the officers lost his grip and fell around eight feet, suffering an ankle injury. The video does not capture Crooks during this sequence, but the tension and urgency of the situation are palpable.\n\nAs the footage concludes, it reveals Crooks' body surrounded by officers after he was lethally shot by a Secret Service sniper. In the video, a police officer expresses his frustration, stating, \"I'm f***ing p***ed. We couldn't find him.\"\n\nAnother officer recounts his harrowing experience of being on the roof alone, recalling how Crooks turned around and startled him, causing him to fall. \"Before you motherf*****s came up here, I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself, dude,\" the officer says in the video.\n\n\"Then he turned around and I f***ing dropped, and I was fing calling out, 'Bro, f***ing on top of the roof.' We're not on the same frequency,\" he added, highlighting the communication challenges faced by the officers.\n\nAccording to Lieutenant Matthew Pearson of the Butler Township Police Department, the officer who had scaled the rooftop found himself in a precarious position, hanging from the building and unable to draw his weapon. It was at this moment that Crooks opened fire, resulting in a minor injury to Trump's right ear.\n\nThe gunfire also tragically claimed the life of 50-year-old Corey Comparatore, who died protecting his family, and left two other individuals, David Dutch and James Copenhaver, injured. Both Dutch and Copenhaver have since been discharged from the hospital and are recuperating at home.\n\nThe incident has raised serious questions about the security measures in place during the rally. Mere moments before the gunfire erupted, Copenhaver's camera captured footage of an individual moving on the rooftop -- a critical security lapse that acting Secret Service Director Ronaldo Rowe later acknowledged as a 'failure' on their part.\n\nAccording to FBI reports, Crooks arrived at the rally venue around 11 am and lingered for an hour before leaving, only to return at approximately 3:50 pm. Local law enforcement first noticed him around 5:10 pm, just 30 minutes before Trump was scheduled to speak.\n\nCrooks operated a drone near the rally site, but it did not record any footage. At about 5:30 pm, law enforcement took a photograph of Crooks and relayed it to their headquarters with a message, alerting officials to his presence and activities.\n\nAt approximately 6:12 pm, Crooks fired eight shots at Trump, hitting him in the ear. A Secret Service sniper then neutralized him within seconds.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\u2013style_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AR-15\u2013style rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPMS_Panther_Arms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DPMS Panther Arms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://static-gi.asianetnews.com/images/01j3g71722p9f9bg0bd7y5nr01/donald-trump-assassination-attempt--1-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Bodycam video shows delays after police spotted Trump shooter", "body": "Bodycam video released by Butler Township reveals the crucial seconds before former President Donald Trump was shot on July 13 in Pennsylvania.\n\nNew videos from local officials in Pennsylvania emphasize how close officers were to preventing the shooting of former president Donald Trump last month.\n\nSeveral hours of videos from body and dashboard cameras, released Thursday by Butler Township, show officers rushing to the scene of a manufacturing building outside the security perimeter minutes before the shooting. Soon, a man perched on the roof of that building with an AR-style rifle would fire on a nearby Trump rally, killing one man and wounding others including Trump.\n\nThe videos further reveal the confusion, overlapping radio traffic and challenges officers had in communicating at the large, open-air event.\n\nOne pivotal video shows the moments just before 6:11 p.m. as a local officer is boosted up to peer over the edge of the metal roof of the American Glass Research building where Thomas Matthew Crooks was perched.\n\nAfter spotting Crooks to his left, the unidentified officer quickly drops down and sprints to his squad car in the parking lot to retrieve a long gun.\n\nThirty seconds later, the first of eight shots ring out.\n\n\"I was this close, bro, and he turned around on me,\" he says to another officer in the parking lot a minute later, both with guns drawn.\n\nFive minutes passed from the moment the officer eyes Crooks to when officers in tactical gear successfully make it onto the roof. The videos capture the chaotic scene as some officers race inside the building and others look for anything that would help them scale its exterior walls.\n\nThe officer who originally spotted Crooks spent most of those five minutes on the ground alongside other officers, standing first behind his squad car and then in front of the building's entrance, describing to tactical teams what he saw.\n\n\"He's laying down on the next building over,\" the out-of-breath officer says. \"He's got glasses, long hair... I climbed the wall, popped my head right in front of him.\" The officer says the man had a bookbag and an \"AR,\" the rifle.\n\nOne officer, with the help of another, hoists himself onto a plastic Craftsman storage shed next to the building and leans a wood pallet against the wall as if to climb it, but does not do so. Others scream for somebody to fetch a ladder.\n\nThe officer who originally saw Crooks warns the others climbing up to be careful: \"Watch out because he can come right down on you over there!\"\n\nAnother minute passes. Some officers remain confused about which roof the shooter is on.\n\n\"This building!\" yells the officer who had boosted himself up. \"The left one! Left side! The first one! That one!\"\n\nFinally, an officer in tactical gear manages to climb up.\n\n\"Let me see your hands!\" he roars.\n\nBut by then, a sniper from afar has already taken aim. A stream of blood is seen running down the sloped metal from Crooks' body. It is 6:16 p.m.\n\nAcknowledging the breakdowns\n\nFederal officials have testified in Congress that the local officials relayed they were monitoring a suspicious person minutes before the former president was shot. It wasn't until the local officer spotted the shooter with a rifle that they escalated the risk to an imminent threat.\n\nMore: Trump's would-be assassin had little time to prepare - and left little trace of plot\n\nInteroperability and collaboration between Secret Service and local police has become a flashpoint in the review of the shooting.\n\nButler Township police declined to comment Thursday evening.\n\nSecret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that the agency \"is aware of and reviewing the bodycam footage from July 13 that was recently released by local law enforcement.\"\n\n\"The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was a U.S. Secret Service failure,\" Guglielmi said, \"and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\"\n\nIn dramatic testimony before Congress late last month, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald L. Rowe, Jr. did not try to defend the agency's security posture before the shooting, including coverage of the building that Crooks used to fire off eight shots.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said in his testimony before a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee. \"I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe has also stressed that the federal agency would in no way try to pass any blame on to local, county and state police, since overall protection of the rally is the Secret Service's responsibility.\n\nRowe said he has ordered expanded use of unmanned aerial systems to help detect threats on roofs and other elevated positions going forward. He said he has also directed resources to facilitate communications with state and local security partners.\n\nRowe took over as acting director of the service after Kimberly Cheatle resigned from the role on July 23, following mounting pressure from lawmakers and many in the public.\n\nConfusion at the scene\n\nIn the footage released Thursday, audio timestamped at 6:11 p.m. plays a volley of three shots, then a quick succession of more shots, similar to the way interim U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe described Crooks' assassination attempt at a briefing last week.\n\nThe FBI has determined that the shooter surveyed the rally site at 11 a.m. on July 13, a Saturday, drove home to pick up his rifle and arrived back at the site at 3:45. He parked his car and flew a drone over the rally from 3:50 p.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nShortly later at 5 p.m., local law enforcement spotted him and tagged him as suspicious near the AGR building. They lost sight of him until 5:30, when SWAT officers noticed him using a range finder.\n\nThe FBI believes the shooter climbed air conditioning equipment to get on the metal roof. He then was spotted by the local officer in the video at 6:11 p.m.\n\nWithin 25 seconds, he fired eight shots.

On top of the roof,\" he says in the video. \"Were you not on the same frequency?\"\n\nLess than an hour after the shooting, local police already were second-guessing how Trump was in a position to be shot even after concerns were raised about the suspicious man.\n\n\"When I saw someone running across the roof they probably should have taken Trump off the stage,\" one local officer tells another. \"But it's not my call.\"\n\nIn another video, local police question why the roof didn't have coverage from the Secret Service.\n\n\"I ... told them they need to post guys ... over here,\" the officer says.\n\n\"Who?\" another officer asks.\n\n\"The Secret Service,\" the first officer replies. \"I told them that ...

The officer finds himself facing the barrel of the gunman's weapon.\n\nThe footage, provided to Fox News Digital, was recorded by the Butler Township police officer who was boosted to the roof of AGR International on July 13. The officer tries to pull himself up, looks over the edge, and quickly jumps back down, and while Crooks is not visible in the video, the officer said that the shooter aimed his AR-15 at him.\n\nHorrifying New Footage\n\nIn an instant, he drops back down to the ground and runs around the building, apparently alerting nearby officers and bystanders. With increasing scrutiny on the Secret Service's management of the incident, the officer was also heard claiming that he had previously warned agents about the exposed rooftop.\n\nThe video is silent at the beginning, but the audio activates halfway through, exposing the chaotic situation.\n\n\"He's wearing glasses and has long hair,\" the officer says, describing Crooks' backpack and the AR-15 rifle he was carrying.\n\n\"I f***ing told them they need to post a guy over here,\" the officer said, in separate footage obtained by CNN. \"I told them that on Tuesday, told them to post guys over here.\"\n\nOver the officer's radio, requests for an ambulance to be sent to the rally's VIP tent are audible.\n\nAfter a brief period of the officers standing back and surrounding the building, they move forward and start helping each other climb onto the roof.\n\nThe officer who initially looked over the edge then requests to return to the roof, where Crooks is found dead with a long streak of blood running down the sloped rooftop.\n\nThe ledge he climbed onto was about 12 feet above the ground, and he fell around eight feet, injuring his ankle when Crooks aimed his weapon at him.\n\nFailing to Stop Crooks\n\nThe officer couldn't draw his own gun on Crooks because both hands were occupied as he attempted to get onto the roof, as previously explained by Butler Township police Lt. Matthew Pearson, which is clearly shown in the bodycam footage.\n\n\"Before you motherf -- -s came up here, I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself, dude,\" he says. \"Then he turned around and I f -- -- dropped and I started f -- -- I was calling out, bro, f -- -- on top of the roof.\"\n\n\"F -- -- we're not on the same frequency?\"\n\nAdditional body camera footage, obtained by the Wall Street Journal, revealed that Butler Township Police Department officers expressed their frustration with the Secret Service's choice to leave the roof -- just 130 yards from where Trump was speaking -- unmanned.\n\n\"I f-king told them they need to post a guy f-king over here,\" one officer is heard saying shortly after the shots rang out.\n\n\"Who?\" another officer asks.\n\n\"The Secret Service,\" the officer responds. \"I told them that f-king Tuesday.\"\n\nThe video also reveals that there was some uncertainty about whether the roof was secured. \"I thought you guys were on the roof,\" one officer tells the cop who claims to have warned the Secret Service.\n\n\"No, we were inside,\" he responds. \"I told them to post f-king guys over here.\"\n\n\"I wasn't even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof ... how in the hell can you lose a guy walking back here if someone is on the roof?\" the other officer wonders.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

He was then killed by a Secret Service sniper.\n\nThe incident injured the Republican presidential candidate, killed 50-year-old volunteer firefighter Corey Comperatore and left two others critically injured.\n\nWhen audio was later picked up on the bodycam, the officer who saw Crooks could be heard shouting \"he's straight up\" and asking \"who has eyes on him\".\n\n\"He was right where you picked me up bro\", he continued.\n\n\"He was on that left side.\"\n\nAt one point after the shots were fired, the officer could be heard shouting \"don't pull up your head, he's right there\" to other law enforcement officers.\n\nConversation that could be heard over the radio included an officer saying: \"We have two civilians - tending to them. I need an ambulance in the back.\"\n\nNear the end of the footage, armed officers are seen scaling the building.\n\nThe footage then cuts to a clip showing the scene on the roof after Crooks was shot dead. His body is seen lying on the roof next to a rifle and a blood trail.\n\nThe new footage was released after CNN submitted a public record request to Butler Township Police and appealed when they initially refused to release video involving officers or personnel related to the shooting at the rally.\n\nSecret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency was reviewing the footage, CNN reported.\n\n\"The US Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,\" he said.\n\n\"The attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump was a US Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\"\n\nAbout two hours before the shooting, Crooks flew a drone over the area about 180 metres from the stage where Trump spoke to the crowd, and live-streamed footage for about 11 minutes.\n\nCrude explosive devices were later recovered from Crooks's car and home. They were designed to be detonated remotely. Crooks had a transmitter with him.\n\nThe FBI believes he would not have been successful had he tried to detonate the devices.\n\nFBI director Christopher Wray last month said Crooks, 20, searched online for information on the John F Kennedy assassination.\n\n\"Analysis of a laptop that the investigation ties to the shooter reveals that on July 6, he did a Google search for -- quote -- 'how far away was Oswald from Kennedy','\" Mr Wray told a US House Judiciary Committee.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald assassinated former president Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.\n\nKimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the Secret Service on July 24, after coming under scrutiny following the assassination attempt.\n\nShe had told a US congressional oversight hearing that the incident was the agency's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades, adding that she took \"full responsibility\".", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director of the United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Seconds later, a Secret Service sniper shot and killed Crooks.\n\nThe video does not show Crooks on the roof before the shooting and there is no audio around the moment the officer climbed up and quickly dropped down after coming face-to-face with the shooter.\n\nAfter the encounter, the officer runs around to another side of the building before running to his police car to retrieve a rifle.\n\n\"F**king this close bro,\" the officer who saw Crooks says to another officer. \"Dude, he turned around on me.\"\n\nOne officer asks where the shooter is and the officer, panting, says, \"He's straight up.\"\n\n\"Who's got eyes on him?\" the officer asks. \"He was right where you picked me up, bro. He was on that left side.\"\n\nOver the radio a voice says: \"We have two civilians - tending to them,\" and later, \"I need an ambulance in the back.\"\n\nThis video was released by Butler Township Police Department in response to CNN's public records request that asked for any body-camera video or dash-camera video involving Butler Township officers or personnel related to the rally and shooting at Butler Farm Show on July 13.

Crooks attempted to assassinate Trump at a campaign rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. He shot Trump in the ear, killed one audience member and wounded two others.

The first piece of footage shows the officer with body camera footage being hoisted on top of the roof and then immediately ducking down and sprinting toward his car to grab a more powerful weapon.\n\n\"F*ck, this close, bro.

He's got a boot bag, he's got mad s*it, an AR laying down. He's laying down, he's got a boot bag next to him,\" the officer told the others.\n\nMoments later, the officer demanded to be lifted onto the rooftop, where he approached three other law enforcement members. Officers can be seen standing over Crook's corpse after counter snipers fatally shot him.\n\nA second piece of footage shows the officer talking to another state or local law enforcement officer expressing how angry they were that they could not find Crooks. They reportedly discussed how law enforcement were on different radio frequencies, making it difficult to communicate.\n\n\"I'm f*cking p*ssed, bro. We couldn't find him,\" another officer said.\n\nAdditional footage shows an officer ordering people to exit the location as he had not confirmed Crooks was dead. Officers were unsure whether there were multiple threats at the time.\n\n\"Alright, threat one is down. Threat one is down,\" an officer said over the intercom confirming Crooks' death. \"Threat one is down, we need to secure the rest of the area.\"\n\nOfficers were unsure why the roof had not been occupied by law enforcement members, according to Fox News.\n\n\"I thought you were on the roof?\" one officer said.\n\n\"If you'd all had a gun up there ... I'd have shot him. He wouldn't have ripped out a gun up there,\" an officer said.\n\nFootage released on July 31 showed a figure believed to be Crooks visibly walking across the roof nearly 3 minutes before the shooting occurred at 6:11 p.m EDT. The footage was taken by James Copenhaver, a victim shot twice during the incident.\n\nThe shooting injured the upper portion of Trump's right ear and killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, a former volunteer fire chief, while he shielded his two daughters from the shooting. Copenhaver and 57-year-old David Dutch were also critically injured during the incident.\n\nWhistleblowers told Republican Missouri Sen. John Hawley that Secret Service agents were initially assigned to be present on the roof but left the area due to the hot temperature. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle claimed no agents were stationed on the roof because of the unsafe \"sloped roof.\"\n\nCheatle resigned on July 23 following a joint statement from House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and ranking member Jamie Raskin from July 22, which stated that she \"failed to provide answers\" about the \"stunning operational failure\" that occurred during the rally.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The shooter cannot be seen in this angle of bodycam video, and there is no audio.\n\nNBC News has previously reported that in that moment, the officer came face to face with the shooter, Thomas Crooks, who pointed his weapon at the officer, prompting the officer to hit the ground, according to Butler Township Manager Tom Knights.\n\nLater in the video, the officer appears to confirm the encounter, saying, \"f -- -- this close, dude, he turned right around on me.\"\n\nOfficials later determined that the shooter was on top of a building in a complex next to the Butler Farm Show -- where Trump was giving his speech -- which was roughly 148 yards from Trump and outside the safety perimeter set by the Secret Service that day.\n\nCrooks fired eight shots, nicking Trump in the ear, killing one rallygoer and critically injuring two others. Crooks was shot and killed by counter-snipers within seconds.\n\nA later portion of the same video clip shows the Butler Township officer jumping back onto the rooftop. In that video, Crooks' bloodied body can be seen, handcuffed, after Secret Service snipers shot and killed him.\n\n\"Before you motherf -- -- came out here I put my head up here like a f -- -- - idiot by myself dude...\" the officer said on radio traffic captured in the clip. \"I was calling out, 'bro, on top of the roof, bro,' were you on the same frequency?\"\n\nAn unknown member of the SWAT team then said he was \"pissed\" that he \"couldn't ... find him,\" apparently referring to Crooks.\n\nIn another clip released Thursday, an unidentified Butler Township officer said about 10 minutes after Trump was shot that he told the Secret Service about the building's vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nThe officer is heard saying that he \"told them they needed to post the guys over here. I told them that.\"\n\nWhen asked \"who\" he told, the officer replied: \"the Secret Service.\"\n\nThe officer said he told Secret Service members July 9 -- four days before the July 13 event -- to \"post guys over here,\" referring to the building where the shooter was found.\n\n\"How the hell could you lose a guy walking over here?\" the officer said.\n\nAsked whether the officer's team was on the roof, the officer answered no and said the team was inside. Some back and forth can be heard in the audio about where people were stationed.\n\nThe officer added that the Secret Service assured officials earlier in the week that \"we're going to post guys over here.\" He does not specify the location in the video.\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, U.S. Secret Service spokesperson, said in a statement that the agency is reviewing the video.\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,\" Guglielmi said. \"The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was a U.S. Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\"\n\nPennsylvania State Police has said it identified Crooks as \"suspicious\" before the attack.\n\nThe Secret Service has been criticized for its handling of the incident and any warnings before Trump took the stage, for how long it took to get the former president off the stage, and for its preparedness before the rally.\n\nAmid the fallout, the head of the agency, Kimberly Cheatle, stepped down from her post. Days later, the acting head of the Secret Service said in a Senate committee hearing that Secret Service agents could be fired if it is found they broke protocol that day.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SWAT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trump-describes-in-detail-being-shot-by-a-would-be-assassin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 432, "textEnd": 439, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 2554, "textEnd": 2560}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The first piece of footage shows the officer with body camera footage being hoisted on top of the roof and then immediately ducking down and sprinting toward his car to grab a more powerful weapon.\n\n\"F*ck, this close, bro. Dude he turned around on me,\" the officer lifted to the roof said about the shooter.\n\nCrooks reportedly pointed his weapon at the officer before he ducked his head, according to Fox News.\n\n\"I pulled my head right in front of him, bro. He's got a boot bag, he's got mad s*it, an AR laying down. He's laying down, he's got a boot bag next to him,\" the officer told the others.\n\nMoments later, the officer demanded to be lifted onto the rooftop, where he approached three other law enforcement members. Officers can be seen standing over Crook's corpse after counter snipers fatally shot him.\n\nA second piece of footage shows the officer talking to another state or local law enforcement officer expressing how angry they were that they could not find Crooks. They reportedly discussed how law enforcement were on different radio frequencies, making it difficult to communicate.\n\n\"I'm f*cking p*ssed, bro. We couldn't find him,\" another officer said.\n\nAdditional footage shows an officer ordering people to exit the location as he had not confirmed Crooks was dead. Officers were unsure whether there were multiple threats at the time.\n\n\"Alright, threat one is down. Threat one is down,\" an officer said over the intercom confirming Crooks' death. \"Threat one is down, we need to secure the rest of the area.\"\n\nOfficers were unsure why the roof had not been occupied by law enforcement members, according to Fox News.\n\n\"I thought you were on the roof?\" one officer said.\n\n\"If you'd all had a gun up there ... I'd have shot him. He wouldn't have ripped out a gun up there,\" an officer said.\n\nFootage released on July 31 showed a figure believed to be Crooks visibly walking across the roof nearly 3 minutes before the shooting occurred at 6:11 p.m EDT. The footage was taken by James Copenhaver, a victim shot twice during the incident.\n\nThe shooting injured the upper portion of Trump's right ear and killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, a former volunteer fire chief, while he shielded his two daughters from the shooting. Copenhaver and 57-year-old David Dutch were also critically injured during the incident.\n\nWhistleblowers told Republican Missouri Sen. John Hawley that Secret Service agents were initially assigned to be present on the roof but left the area due to the hot temperature. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle claimed no agents were stationed on the roof because of the unsafe \"sloped roof.\"\n\nCheatle resigned on July 23 following a joint statement from House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and ranking member Jamie Raskin from July 22, which stated that she \"failed to provide answers\" about the \"stunning operational failure\" that occurred during the rally.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Before Dropping Shock Admission", "body": "In a heart-stopping turn of events, newly released bodycam footage has shed even more light on the near-assassination of former President Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe video captures the tense moments when a local police officer came face-to-face with the would-be assassin, Thomas Crooks, on July 13.\n\nDaily Mail reported that the footage begins at 6:11 PM, the exact moment Trump was fired upon.\n\nA Butler police officer, whose identity remains undisclosed, is seen being lifted onto a rooftop approximately 150 yards from Trump's speaking location.\n\nIn a split second, the officer spots Crooks and his AR-15, prompting him to quickly retreat.\n\n\"F***ing this close bro,\" the officer is heard saying to his colleagues after descending from the roof. \"And he turned around on me.\"\n\nThe video shows the officer sprinting halfway towards Trump's location before turning back to regroup with other law enforcement personnel.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the officer hurriedly assembles his own rifle behind a car door, preparing for a potential confrontation.\n\nThe footage then depicts a flurry of activity as heavily armed teams in camouflage converge on the scene.\n\nThe officer provides a description of Crooks to the tactical units, stating, \"He's laying down... he's got glasses, long hair.\"\n\nThe officer also claims he had warned Secret Service agents about the vulnerable rooftop days before the incident.\n\n\"I f***ing told them they need to post a guy over here,\" he says in the video, obtained by CNN.\n\n\"I told them that on Tuesday, told them to post guys over here.\"\n\nHe later noted, \"I talked to the Secret Service, and they said no problem we're going to post guys over here,\" referring to Crooks' roof location.\n\n\"I climbed the wall, and I poked my head right in front of him bro... he's got a book bag, he's got mad s***,\" the officer says to his colleagues during another part of the video.\n\nThis statement raises even more questions about the Secret Service's security preparations for the event.\n\nThe rooftop, which offered a clear line of sight to Trump within AR-15 range, was reportedly left unguarded despite the officer's warnings.\n\nThe situation was resolved within seconds when Secret Service snipers positioned on a nearby perch fatally shot Crooks, but this only came after Trump was struck in the ear by a bullet.\n\nAdditional footage concludes with law enforcement surveying the scene, including Crooks' body and a trail of blood on the rooftop.\n\nThis incident has sparked a debate about event security protocols and the coordination between local law enforcement and federal agencies.\n\nThe Butler police officer's prior warnings and the subsequent security lapse highlight glaring areas for improvement in protecting high-profile individuals.\n\nAs investigations continue, this bodycam footage provides crucial insight into the split-second decisions and intense pressure faced by law enforcement during such high-stakes situations.\n\nDavid Dutch, one of the two Trump supporters injured by Crooks, recently made his first public statement since being discharged from Allegheny County General Hospital last month.\n\nDutch and his family expressed profound gratitude for the overwhelming support they have received.\n\nThey also extended a heartfelt thanks to the \"brave men and women\" who played crucial roles in saving Dutch's life.", "source": {"uri": "resistthemainstream.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Resist the

The shooter cannot be seen in this angle of bodycam video, and there is no audio.\n\nNBC News has previously reported that in that moment, the officer came face to face with the shooter, Thomas Crooks, who pointed his weapon at the officer, prompting the officer to hit the ground, according to Butler Township Manager Tom Knights.\n\nLater in the video, the officer appears to confirm the encounter, saying, \"f------ this close, dude, he turned right around on me.\"\n\nOfficials later determined that the shooter was on top of a building in a complex next to the Butler Farm Show -- where Trump was giving his speech -- which was roughly 148 yards from Trump and outside the safety perimeter set by the Secret Service that day.\n\nCrooks fired eight shots, nicking Trump in the ear, killing one rallygoer and critically injuring two others. Crooks was shot and killed by counter-snipers within seconds.\n\nA later portion of the same video clip shows the Butler Township officer jumping back onto the rooftop. In that video, Crooks' bloodied body can be seen, handcuffed, after Secret Service snipers shot and killed him.\n\n\"Before you motherf------ came out here I put my head up here like a f------- idiot by myself dude...\" the officer said on radio traffic captured in the clip. \"I was calling out, 'bro, on top of the roof, bro,' were you on the same frequency?\"\n\nAn unknown member of the SWAT team then said he was \"pissed\" that he \"couldn't ... find him,\" apparently referring to Crooks.\n\nIn another clip released Thursday, an unidentified Butler Township officer said about 10 minutes after Trump was shot that he told the Secret Service about the building's vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nThe officer is heard saying that he \"told them they needed to post the guys over here. I told them that.\"\n\nWhen asked \"who\" he told, the officer replied: \"the Secret Service.\"\n\nThe officer said he told Secret Service members July 9 -- four days before the July 13 event -- to \"post guys over here,\" referring to the building where the shooter was found.\n\n\"How the hell could you lose a guy walking over here?\" the officer said.\n\nAsked whether the officer's team was on the roof, the officer answered no and said the team was inside. Some back and forth can be heard in the audio about where people were stationed.\n\nThe officer added that the Secret Service assured officials earlier in the week that \"we're going to post guys over here.\" He does not specify the location in the video.\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, U.S. Secret Service spokesperson, said in a statement that the agency is reviewing the video.\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,\" Guglielmi said. \"The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was a U.S. Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again.\"\n\nPennsylvania State Police has said it identified Crooks as \"suspicious\" before the attack.\n\nThe Secret Service has been criticized for its handling of the incident and any warnings before Trump took the stage, for how long it took to get the former president off the stage, and for its preparedness before the rally.\n\nAmid the fallout, the head of the agency, Kimberly Cheatle, stepped down from her post.

The first piece of footage shows the officer with body camera footage being hoisted on top of the roof and then immediately ducking down and sprinting toward his car to grab a more powerful weapon.\n\n\"F*ck, this close, bro. Dude he turned around on me,\" the officer lifted to the roof said about the shooter.\n\nCrooks reportedly pointed his weapon at the officer before he ducked his head, according to Fox News.\n\n\"I pulled my head right in front of him, bro. He's got a boot bag, he's got mad s*it, an AR laying down. He's laying down, he's got a boot bag next to him,\" the officer told the others.\n\nMoments later, the officer demanded to be lifted onto the rooftop, where he approached three other law enforcement members. Officers can be seen standing over Crook's corpse after counter snipers fatally shot him.\n\nA second piece of footage shows the officer talking to another state or local law enforcement officer expressing how angry they were that they could not find Crooks. They reportedly discussed how law enforcement was on different radio frequencies, making it difficult to communicate.\n\n\"I'm f*cking p*ssed, bro. We couldn't find him,\" another officer said.\n\nAdditional footage shows an officer ordering people to exit the location as he had not confirmed Crooks was dead. Officers were unsure whether there were multiple threats at the time.\n\n\"Alright, threat one is down. Threat one is down,\" an officer said over the intercom confirming Crooks' death. \"Threat one is down, we need to secure the rest of the area.\"\n\nOfficers were unsure why the roof had not been occupied by law enforcement members, according to Fox News.\n\n\"I thought you were on the roof?\" one officer said.\n\n\"If you'd all had a gun up there ... I'd have shot him. He wouldn't have ripped out a gun up there,\" an officer said.\n\nFootage released on July 31 showed a figure believed to be Crooks visibly walking across the roof nearly 3 minutes before the shooting occurred at 6:11 p.m. EDT. The footage was taken by James Copenhaver, a victim shot twice during the incident.\n\nThe shooting injured the upper portion of Trump's right ear and killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, a former volunteer fire chief, while he shielded his two daughters from the shooting. Copenhaver and 57-year-old David Dutch were also critically injured during the incident.\n\nWhistleblowers told Republican Missouri Sen. John Hawley that Secret Service agents were initially assigned to be present on the roof but left the area due to the hot temperature. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle claimed no agents were stationed on the roof because of the unsafe \"sloped roof.\"\n\nCheatle resigned on July 23 following a joint statement from House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and ranking member Jamie Raskin from July 22, which stated that she \"failed to provide answers\" about the \"stunning operational failure\" that occurred during the rally.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

One attendee was killed and two more were wounded.\n\nThere have been many questions about how the Secret Service and local authorities failed to the point Crooks, a seemingly untalented loner, was able to beat the security and get off multiple clean shots.\n\nWhile the stunning failures haven't been fully explained, there is more body camera footage to analyze.\n\nIn one moment of the footage, one of the people rushing to the building - unclear if medical or a cop - can be heard saying he saw the shooter's head \"pop off.\"\n\nThat would appear to confirm speculation that Crooks took a heavy rifle round directly to the head. Another part of the body camera footage shows an officer attempting to get on the roof prior to the shooting starting. He stumbles down after barely getting a looking over the edge. The officer then rushes to get a rifle out of his vehicle.\n\nYou can watch the stunning footage in the two posts below, and let me know what you think at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.\n\nThe shooting happened nearly a month ago, and it's still hard to believe it's real.

Seconds later, a Secret Service sniper shot and killed Crooks.\n\nThe video does not show Crooks on the roof before the shooting and there is no audio around the moment the officer climbed up and quickly dropped down after coming face-to-face with the shooter.\n\nAfter the encounter, the officer runs around to another side of the building before running to his police car to retrieve a rifle.\n\n\"F**king this close bro,\" the officer who saw Crooks says to another officer. \"Dude, he turned around on me.\"\n\nOne officer asks where the shooter is and the officer, panting, says, \"He's straight up.\"\n\n\"Who's got eyes on him?\" the officer asks. \"He was right where you picked me up, bro. He was on that left side.\"\n\nOver the radio a voice says: \"We have two civilians - tending to them,\" and later, \"I need an ambulance in the back.\"\n\nThis video was released by Butler Township Police Department in response to CNN's public records request that asked for any body-camera video or dash-camera video involving Butler Township officers or personnel related to the rally and shooting at Butler Farm Show on July 13. The township initially declined to release the content but did after CNN appealed.\n\nIn a separate video released by the Butler police, one officer can be heard telling colleagues about 10 minutes after the shooting that he had told Secret Service to post law enforcement by the building that Crooks fired from.\n\n\"I f**king told them they need to post the guys f**king over here,\" the officer said. \"I told them that, the f**king, the Secret Service, I told them that f**king Tuesday. I told them to post f**king guys over here.\"\n\nAnother officer replied that he wasn't \"even concerned about it because I thought someone was on the roof. I thought that's how we -- how in the hell can you lose a guy walking back here?\"\n\n\"I talked to the Secret Service guys, they were like, 'Yeah, no problem, we're going to post guys over here,'\" the first officer said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Nearly half of those visits were in the first four months after he obtained membership, according to the records. He visited on Halloween, Christmas Day, and Valentine's Day. The records show Crooks focused more on the rifle range rather than the pistol range.\n\nCrooks attended target practice around three to six times per month in 2024.

HAWLEY REVEALS NEW WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS ABOUT SECRET SERVICE FAILURES AT TRUMP RALLY: 'SCARED TO DEATH'\n\nCrooks was able to scale the roof of a building owned by AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15 style rifle.\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nAfter mounting pressure, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned, following heated testimony before the House Oversight Committee.\n\n\"To the Men and Women of the U.S. Secret Service, The Secret Service's solemn mission is to protect our nation's leaders and financial infrastructure,\" Cheatle wrote in a letter to the agency. \"On July 13th, we fell short on that mission.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCheatle said that the \"scrutiny\" over the last week \"has been intense and will continue to remain as our operational tempo increases.\"\n\n\"As your Director, I take full responsibility for the security lapse,\" she wrote.\n\nFox News Digital's Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shooting range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Grassley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Oversight_and_Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\u2013style_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AR-15\u2013style rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://wfin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/WFIN-AM-FM-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 2691, "textEnd": 2700}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-08-", "textStart": 385, "textEnd": 394}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 1056, "textEnd": 1063}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The video footage later shows two Secret Service agents inside the building.\n\nTRUMP SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW GUNMAN EVADED SECURITY\n\nSpeaking to another officer, he says, \"I talked to the Secret Service guys, and they were like, 'Yeah, no problem, we're going to post guys over here.'\"\n\nA few minutes later, the Butler Township police officer speaks to a countersniper and reiterates his claims that he told the Secret Service to have agents at the venue.\n\n\"I told the Secret Service, post a f---ing guy over here. I told them that f---ing at the meeting on Tuesday.\"\n\nThe footage also shows the officer arriving on the scene at around 18:12 p.m., about a minute after Crooks was shot dead by a countersniper. The officer is desperately looking to scale the building and asks a fellow officer if there was a ladder he could climb.\n\n\"No, he used that board right there probably,\" the other officer says, with the video showing a stack of wooden pallets resting against the side of the building. It's not clear if Crooks used those pallets to climb on top of the building. Previous reports revealed that Crooks had purchased a ladder at a local Home Depot, but no ladder was found at the scene.\n\nThe video also reveals the difficulty and frantic efforts police had trying to get onto the building.\n\nThe officer manages to hoist two countersnipers onto the roof by helping them onto a large storage shed, and they then use a pallet on the roof of the shed to access the roof. The pallet had initially been resting against the building next to the storage shed and could also have been used by Crooks.\n\nThe bodycam footage is one of several videos obtained by Fox News Digital on Thursday through a records request. In another video, one police officer scales the building but is confronted by Crooks and then falls to the ground.\n\nThe gunfire also wounded audience members David Dutch and James Copenhaver. They have both since returned home, with Dutch on Wednesday providing Fox News with an exclusive statement on the deadly incident.\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service is aware of and reviewing the bodycam footage from July 13 that was recently released by local law enforcement,\" the agency said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day.

The footage was taken by James Copenhaver, a victim shot twice during the incident.\n\nThe shooting injured the upper portion of Trump's right ear and killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, a former volunteer fire chief, while he shielded his two daughters from the shooting. Copenhaver and 57-year-old David Dutch were also critically injured during the incident.\n\nWhistleblowers told Republican Missouri Sen. John Hawley that Secret Service agents were initially assigned to be present on the roof but left the area due to the hot temperature. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle claimed no agents were stationed on the roof because of the unsafe \"sloped roof.\"\n\nCheatle resigned on July 23 following a joint statement from House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer and ranking member Jamie Raskin from July 22, which stated that she \"failed to provide answers\" about the \"stunning operational failure\" that occurred during the rally.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Matthew Pearson, the acting chief of the Butler Township Police Department, told Fox News Digital the footage is being prepared for public release and that it will provide a clearer picture of the seconds leading up to the deadly July 13 shooting.\n\nTRUMP SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT\n\nAnother officer helped hoist the officer onto the roof of the American Glass Research (AGR) building after some people in the crowd pointed and screamed that there was a suspicious individual with a gun on the roof.\n\nThe hoisted officer was able to grab hold of the edge of the building's roof, which was 12 feet above the ground, Butler Township Manager Thomas Knights previously told Fox News Digital. As the officer lifted himself up, Knights said the officer spotted an individual on the roof who \"was identified as having a weapon\" and \"did point that firearm at our officer.\"\n\nAs Crooks pointed the firearm at the officer, the officer ducked his head, losing his grip on the roof's edge and falling about eight feet to the ground, spraining his ankle, the township manager said.\n\nPearson told a local outlet that the officer was unable to draw his weapon since he was hanging from the building.\n\nSeconds later, Crooks opened fire.\n\nPAKISTANI MAN WITH TIES TO IRAN CHARGED IN FOILED ASSASSINATION PLOT POTENTIALLY TARGETING TRUMP, DOJ SAYS\n\nHowever, Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe told the New York Post in the wake of the shooting that the officers who interrupted Crooks likely provided enough of a distraction to save Trump's life.\n\n\"If I'm interrupted, and I move my gun, you are going to have to reassess that whole situation at this point, so yes, you can make a case that those two officers saved the president's life,\" Slupe told the outlet.\n\nTRUMP SHOOTER THOMAS CROOKS CLASSMATES DESCRIBE QUIET STUDENT AS INVESTIGATORS SEARCH FOR MOTIVE\n\nSlupe said \"timing is everything,\" and the interruption to the shooter bought Trump the seconds he needed to miraculously turn his head so that the bullet struck only his ear.\n\n\"Can you imagine 10 seconds before that?\" the sheriff asked. \"That the president was looking straight ahead and where that bullet could have potentially landed.\"\n\nDetails about what exactly took place that day and the security breaches that paved the way for the shooting have been muddied by finger-pointing among the various agencies involved at the local, state and federal levels.\n\nThen Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, in particular, was heavily criticized for not providing regular briefings to the public and ultimately resigned her post.\n\nA public spat between the Secret Service and local police has also raged over who bears most responsibility for the shooting.\n\nNews of the impending bodycam footage release also comes after Butler County denied a Fox News Freedom of Information Act request for bodycam footage and radio communications from the Butler County Sheriff's Office, which is a separate agency from the Butler Township Police Department.\n\nThe Butler County Emergency Services Unit, along with the Beaver and Washington County ESUs, also assisted in security measures that day.\n\n'\"Helmet and body camera footage from all the Butler County officers working physically on site': does not exist in the possession, custody and/or control of Butler County per the Butler County Sheriff, and that portion of the request is therefore denied as permitted by Section 705 of the RTKL (Right-to-Know Law),\" Butler County told Fox News.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nButler County also noted that radio communications between the agencies are being withheld at least while the investigation is ongoing.\n\nFox News' Stephen Sorace and Audrey Conklin contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_dorgan@foxnews.com", "name": "Michael Dorgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The failed assassin reportedly turned the gun on him. More and more videos are emerging as pressure mounts for answers on one of the biggest security lapses in US election history\n\nPolice bodycam footage appeared to show for the first time that the failed assassin of Donald Trump was indeed confronted by cops just split seconds before he fired shots at the former US president and injured him on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile CNN said it obtained the video first, multiple media outlets have since published the nearly four-minute footage.\n\nWhile it's not clearly shown on the video, police said Thomas Crooks, the shooter, turned his gun on the cop who located him on the rooftop of a building, before shooting Trump.\n\nAlso read | 'July 13 will be my premiere': Trump's attacker warned of his sinister plan online days before shooting\n\nThe cop, whose bodycam footage was shared, was initially hoisted up by a colleague onto the rooftop. The bodycam clip shows him reaching the roof, but immediately dropping down. Then he runs for his gun in a nearby police car, and shouts to alert others.\n\nProbably unaware that Crooks has already been killed by a Secret Service Sniper, a bunch of cops gather near the rooftop of the AGI building and someone shouts 'Show me your hands', thinking the suspect is still alive.\n\nSeparate videos have audio from a local cop saying he had asked US Secret Service to put somebody on top of the roof at least four days before the shooting.\n\nAlso Read: Secret Service had marked Thomas Crooks as 'threat' minutes before assassination attempt on Trump\n\nAll this new information documented in such clips will only add to the blame game and sheer lack of accountability exhibited by federal agencies, after gaping security lacunae were exposed in one of the most epic events in this US presidential election season.\n\nAfter seeing Trump on the roof, the cop gathers his gun from a nearby police car and returns to the scene. He shouts: \"F**king this close bro...Dude, he turned around on me.\"\n\n\"He's straight up...Who's got eyes on him?,\" he shouts, adding, \"He was right where you picked me up, bro. He was on that left side.\"\n\nAround this time, the audio of shots being fired could be heard. It must have been Crooks firing at Trump, and the shooter being killed by a Secret Service sniper.\n\nAlso read | SHOCKING VIDEO: People warned cops about Thomas Crooks on roof - 'There he is, you see him?'\n\nIt is clear that the shooting had already happened when the local cop returns to the scene, as there's audio on the walkie-talkie: \"We have two civilians - tending to them...I need an ambulance in the back.\" This was probably a reference to Trump rally attendees being shot.\n\n\"Don't put up your head - he's right there!,\" says the cop whose bodycam was shared. \"He's got glasses, long hair...I climbed the wall and I popped my head right in front of him bro, he's got a book bag, he's got mad s**t, AR laying down.\"\n\nA separate bodycam footage released by police in Butler has a local cop lamenting that he had told Secret Service to post their people in the building. \"I f**king told them they need to post the guys f**king over here...

(NOTE: There are profanities in the original audio, which are bleeped in the recording, and we've censored the written form.)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal did not post the full bodycam videos, just audio from one portion and transcript of others.\n\n\"I f -- ing told them that they needed to post guys f -- ing over here...I told them that f -- ing Tuesday,\" said a Butler Township officer in audio captured on his body-worn camera. \"I talked to the Secret Service guys. They're like, 'Yeah, no problem. We're going to post guys over here.'\"\n\nAnother portion of audio seemingly refers to Crooks:\n\nA police officer in one of the videos at one point refers to a suspicious individual who had been lost by authorities. The unidentified officer referred to \"a gentleman with a flat face that we were looking for earlier. He was creeping people out.\"\n\nThe officer's account, broadcast over radio, was captured on one of the body cameras. \"He was watching people out in the woods by the water tower. I'm not sure he is the gentleman down or not.\"\n\nAbout 10 minutes after the shooting, another audio captures the confusion between officers about whether there were officers stationed on the roof.\n\n\"I thought you guys were on the roof. I thought it was you. I thought it was you.\"\n\n\"No,\" came the reply, with an explanation that no officers were on the roof.\n\n\"What the f -- ,\" the officer replied in frustration. \"Why were we not on the roof? Why weren't we?\"\n\nIn the footage posted by Fox News Digital, it appears the Butler PD radios and the Secret Service radios were not on the same frequency, leading to a lack of communication about the threat posed by Crooks:\n\nThe [footage] captures Crooks toward the end as officers surround his body after countersnipers fatally shot him.\n\n\"I'm f------ p---ed. We couldn't find him,\" another officer can be heard saying in the bodycam footage.\n\n\"Before you motherf-----s came up here, I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself dude,\" the officer who was boosted onto the roof says. \"Then he turned around and I f------ dropped and I started f------ I was calling out bro, f------ on top of the roof. F------ we're not on the same frequency?\"\n\nWSJ details the varying accounts about who was supposed to be on the roof, if anyone, and the communications between local law enforcement and the Secret Service about securing the roof and the AGR campus.\n\nFederal law-enforcement officials have said the Secret Service believed the snipers from the Butler County Emergency Services Unit were supposed to secure the roof of the building where Crooks fired his rifle.\n\nHowever, the local law-enforcement official involved in the event planning previously said the tactical team's heads told the Secret Service during the walk-through that its snipers would be inside the building on its second floor.\n\nButler's team didn't want the snipers on the roof because they would have been exposed to temperatures over 90 degrees throughout the day, the official said. Also the sloped roof would have obscured some of the snipers' vantage points, he said.\n\nOn the day of the rally, the Secret Service had limited interaction with local police, including the Butler County Emergency Services Unit, the official said.\n\nReal Clear's Susan Crabtree, who has been working this story from the beginning, confirmed some of the information in the Wall Street Journal's report and added a bit more from a source within the USSS:\n\nThe Secret Service mistakenly let that go -- did not insist they go up on the roof, agreed to allow them to locate inside the building. That was likely a decision by the lead site agent, a woman, who had little to no experience allocating assets and positioning them appropriately for a out-door rally of this size.\n\n\"It was a mistake...just an overall lax approach to the rally...there's no good explanation for it,\" the source tells me of the Secret Service decision not to insist that the local officers be located on the roof.\n\nThis could have all been avoided if the Secret Service included the AGR campus in its secure area from the start, given its proximity to the stage. The flurry of new information and finger-pointing coming out Thursday hopefully points to a renewed interest in just what happened on July 13 and the days prior.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_van_laar@redstate.com", "name": "Jennifer Van Laar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Gas-cooled_Reactor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/195/b5d88b9d-8d48-434e-90a2-d7a5f8d26e90.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 5005, "textEnd": 5012}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Bodycam video shows delays after police spotted Trump shooter", "body": "Lawmakers grilled the Secret Service director over protocol failures the day Donald Trump was nearly assassinated.\n\nNew videos from local officials in Pennsylvania emphasize how close officers were to preventing the shooting of former president Donald Trump last month.\n\nSeveral hours of videos from body and dashboard cameras, released Thursday by Butler Township, show officers rushing to the scene of a manufacturing building outside the security perimeter minutes before the shooting. Soon, a man perched on the roof of that building with an AR-style rifle would fire on a nearby Trump rally, killing one man and wounding others including Trump.\n\nThe videos further reveal the confusion, overlapping radio traffic and challenges officers had in communicating at the large, open-air event.\n\nOne pivotal video shows the moments at 6:10 p.m. as a local officer is boosted up to peer over the edge of the metal roof of the American Glass Research building where Thomas Matthew Crooks was perched.\n\n\"I was this close, bro, and he turned around on me,\" the unidentified officer says at 6:12 p.m., a minute after shots rang out.\n\n\"He's laying down on the next building over,\" the out-of-breath officer says to tactical teams attempting to get on the roof two minutes after the shooting. \"He's got glasses, long hair... I climbed the wall, popped my head right in front of him, he's got a book bag... he's got an AR.\"\n\nFederal officials have testified in Congress that the local officials had relayed they were working a suspicious individual minutes before the former president was shot. It wasn't until this local officer spotted the shooter with a rifle did they escalate the risk to an imminent threat.\n\nMore: Trump's would-be assassin had little time to prepare - and left little trace of plot\n\nThat left only thirty seconds to scramble police before the shooting.\n\nInteroperability and collaboration between Secret Service and local police has become a flashpoint in the review of the shooting.\n\nButler Township police did not immediately make any representative available to comment.\n\nSecret Service officials were unavailable for comment Thursday.\n\nBut in dramatic testimony before Congress late last month, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald L. Rowe, Jr. did not try to defend the agency's security posture before the shooting, including coverage of the building that Crooks used to fire off eight shots.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said in his testimony before a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee. \"I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe has also stressed that the federal agency would in no way try to pass any blame on to local, county and state police, since overall protection of the rally is the Secret Service's responsibility.\n\nRowe said he has ordered expanded use of unmanned aerial systems to help detect threats on roofs and other elevated positions going forward. He said he has also directed resources to facilitate communications with state and local security partners.\n\nRowe took over as acting director of the service after Kimberly Cheatle resigned from the role on July 23, following mounting pressure from lawmakers and many in the public.\n\nPolice video released Thursday shows officers asking similar questions even on the scene.\n\n\"I was ... calling it out: he's on top of the roof,\" a local officer said later in one video, as teams examined the roof after snipers killed Crooks. \"Are you all not on the same frequency?\"\n\nAnother clip released Thursday shows a police squad rushing to the scene minutes before the shooting.\n\nAudio timestamped at 6:11 p.m. plays a volley of three shots, then a quick succession of more shots, similar to the way interim U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe described Crooks' assassination attempt at a briefing last week.\n\nThe FBI has determined that the shooter surveyed the rally site at 11 a.m. on July 13, a Saturday, drove home to pick up his rifle and arrived back at the site at 3:45. He parked his car and flew a drone over the rally from 3:50 p.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nShortly later at 5 p.m., local law enforcement spotted him and tagged him as suspicious near the AGR building. They lost sight of him until 5:30, when SWAT officers noticed him using a range finder.\n\nThe FBI believes the shooter climbed air conditioning equipment to get on the metal roof. He then was spotted by the local officer in the video at 6:11 p.m.\n\nWithin 25 seconds, he fired eight shots. A Secret Service counter-sniper team then fatally shot him in the head.\n\nLess than an hour after the shooting, local police already were second-guessing how Trump was in a position to be shot after concerns were raised about the suspicious man.\n\n\"When I saw someone running across the roof they probably should have taken Trump off the stage,\" one local officer tells another. \"But it's not my call.\"\n\nIn another video, local police question why the roof didn't have coverage from the Secret Service.\n\n\"I ... told them they need to post guys ... over here,\" the officer says.\n\n\"Who?\" another officer asks.\n\n\"The Secret Service,\" the first officer replies. \"I told them that ...

The term homicide, as it relates to manner of death, means the killing was intentionally carried out by another.\n\nFederal authorities have said Crooks was shot by a Secret Service counter-sniper moments after he began shooting from the roof of a short building just outside the farm grounds. Investigators have said they found eight casings from Crooks' AR-style rifle on the roof near his body.\n\nIt's unclear how many law enforcement officers opened fire and how many shots they fired.\n\nCrooks wounded the former president and two spectators and killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore.\n\nThe shooting at the Butler County rally forced the resignation of Secret Service head Kimberly Cheatle, who said herself that the shooting was the agency's worst failure in decades. Congress, the Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI are conducting separate investigations into the attempted assassination.\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. pledged last week to hold personnel accountable for any policy violations on July 13.

The bottom line is this was a Secret Service failure.\"\n\nLocal law enforcement leaders have vehemently defended the actions taken by Butler and Beaver County officers and Pennsylvania State Police troopers on the day of the rally.

Bodycam video shows delays after police spotted Trump shooter", "body": "Nick Penzenstadler, Kenny Jacoby, Josh Meyer and Chris Kenning, USA TODAY\n\nNew videos from local officials in Pennsylvania emphasize how close officers were to preventing the shooting of former president Donald Trump last month.\n\nSeveral hours of videos from body and dashboard cameras, released Thursday by Butler Township, show officers rushing to the scene of a manufacturing building outside the security perimeter minutes before the shooting. Soon, a man perched on the roof of that building with an AR-style rifle would fire on a nearby Trump rally, killing one man and wounding others including Trump.\n\nThe videos further reveal the confusion, overlapping radio traffic and challenges officers had in communicating at the large, open-air event.\n\nOne pivotal video shows the moments at 6:10 p.m. as a local officer is boosted up to peer over the edge of the metal roof of the American Glass Research building where Thomas Matthew Crooks was perched.\n\n\"I was this close, bro, and he turned around on me,\" the unidentified officer says at 6:12 p.m., a minute after shots rang out.\n\n\"He's laying down on the next building over,\" the out-of-breath officer says to tactical teams attempting to get on the roof two minutes after the shooting. \"He's got glasses, long hair... I climbed the wall, popped my head right in front of him, he's got a book bag... he's got an AR.\"\n\nFederal officials have testified in Congress that the local officials had relayed they were working a suspicious individual minutes before the former president was shot. It wasn't until this local officer spotted the shooter with a rifle did they escalate the risk to an imminent threat.\n\nThat left only thirty seconds to scramble police before the shooting.\n\nInteroperability and collaboration between Secret Service and local police has become a flashpoint in the review of the shooting.\n\nCalls and text messages to the Secret Service for comment were not immediately returned Thursday. Butler Township police did not immediately make any representative available to comment.\n\n\"I was ... calling it out: he's on top of the roof,\" the local officer said later in the video, as teams examined the roof after snipers killed Crooks. \"Are you all not on the same frequency?\"\n\nAnother clip released Thursday shows a police squad rushing to the scene minutes before the shooting.\n\nAudio timestamped at 6:11 p.m. plays a volley of three shots, then a quick succession of more shots, similar to the way interim U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe described Crooks' assassination attempt at a briefing last week.\n\nThe FBI has determined that the shooter surveyed the rally site at 11 a.m. on July 13, a Saturday, drove home to pick up his rifle and arrived back at the site at 3:45. He parked his car and flew a drone over the rally from 3:50 p.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nShortly later at 5 p.m., local law enforcement spotted him and tagged him as suspicious near the AGR building. They lost sight of him until 5:30, when SWAT officers noticed him using a range finder.\n\nThe FBI believes the shooter climbed air conditioning equipment to get on the metal roof. He then was spotted by the local officer in the video at 6:11 p.m.\n\nWithin 25 seconds, he fired eight shots. A Secret Service counter-sniper team then fatally shot him in the head.\n\nLess than an hour after the shooting, local police already were second-guessing how Trump was in a position to be shot after concerns were raised about the suspicious man.\n\n\"When I saw someone running across the roof they probably should have taken Trump off the stage,\" one local officer tells another. \"But it's not my call.\"\n\nIn another video, local police question why the roof didn't have coverage from the Secret Service.\n\n\"I ... told them they need to post guys ... over here,\" the officer says.\n\n\"Who?\" another officer asks.\n\n\"The Secret Service,\" the first officer replies. \"I told them that ...

Trump, struggling to reach the attacker before he shot at Mr. Trump, newly released police videos and a social media video show.\n\nThe body-cam and dashcam footage, paired with an eyewitness video posted on YouTube, provide new insight into the presence of and the response by Pennsylvania law enforcement at the building where the gunman, Thomas Crooks, was positioned. They reveal for the first time the critical moments -- starting around 6:08 p.m. -- when officers establish Mr. Crooks's location, frantically try to find a way to get onto the roof and determine that he is armed. By around 6:11, Mr. Crooks opens fire.\n\nBefore the release of the videos, the exact movements of nearby law enforcement officers -- and the actions they took to address a newly identified threat -- were unclear. Testimony from state police and Secret Service officials provided some details, but the footage obtained by The New York Times through a public records request gives the first second-by-second retelling from the perspectives of two of the officers near the gunman at the time of the shooting.\n\nThe footage also raises more questions as to why the Secret Service failed to remove Mr. Trump from the stage in Butler, Pa., on July 13, while local law enforcement officers were scrambling to get to Mr. Crooks, even if they weren't yet aware that he had a firearm.\n\nThe footage analyzed by The Times includes 12 videos released on Thursday by the Butler Township Police Department, showing at least three Butler officers and one Pennsylvania state trooper focused on the roof from where Mr. Crooks fired.

The officer gets a boost from another officer to get on the building, but quickly drops. He then runs to alert other officers that he saw the gunman and heads to his patrol car to retrieve his gun.\n\nThirty-nine seconds later, Crooks opened fire. Shots grazed the ear of the former president, killed volunteer firefighter and father of two Corey Comperatore, and injured two more rally-goers.\n\n\"He turned around on me,\" the officer who tried to climb on the roof yells to another officer after getting his weapon and struggling to catch his breath. \"Who's got eyes on him?

Seconds later an officer can be heard in the background of the video yelling, \"Let me see your hands, let me see your hands!\"\n\nThe bodycam video shows the officer climbing back onto the building and walking up to the body of the gunman, which is surrounded by three armed officers. The video shows blood running down the roof from the body.\n\nThe officer who first tried to get on the roof had been handling traffic and was part of a group that was called by a local tactical team stationed on the second floor of the building complex after they had grown concerned about a suspicious person. One of the snipers took a picture of the gunman and saw him looking through a rangefinder minutes before the shooting.\n\nIn another bodycam video from the scene, a Butler police officer tells another local officer, \"I f---ing told the Secret Service post a f---ing guy over here. I told them at the f---ing meeting.\"\n\nThe bodycam video also shows the officer who tried to get on the roof and the others cursing and visibly frustrated. \"I popped my head up there like an idiot by myself,\" the officer says. \"He turned around, I f---ing dropped.\"\n\n\"Dude, I was f---ing calling out, bro, on top of the roof.

The Pennsylvania rally shooter injured Trump's ear, killed one person and injured two more, sparking concerns over security and multiple investigations.\n\nIn one clip that was taken just before the shooting, a Butler Township Police Department officer lifts another officer up to take a look at a roof, on which the shooter, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, fired at Trump. Immediately after being lifted up, the officer quickly dropped back down.\n\nThe footage does not show the gunman, but previous reports indicated that the gunman pointed his AR-style rifle at the officer who climbed up to the roof. Roughly 40 seconds later, the shooter fired at Trump.\n\n\"F**king this close bro,\" the officer who saw the gunman says moments later. \"Dude, he turned around on me.\"\n\nIn another clip published by CNN, an officer claims that he previously told the Secret Service to keep an eye on the building.\n\n\"I f**king told them they need to post the guys over here,\" the officer said. \"I told [Secret Service] that, I told them that f**king Tuesday. I told them to post f**king guys over here.\"\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, an agency spokesperson, told HuffPost in a statement that the USSS was looking into the footage.\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service is aware of and reviewing the bodycam footage from July 13 that was recently released by local law enforcement. The U.S. Secret Service appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day,\" Guglielmi's statement read.\n\n\"The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was a U.S. Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again,\" the statement continued.\n\nAside from the footage released Thursday, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley's office also released footage that showed the shooter visited a Pennsylvania gun club called Clairton Sportsmen's Club 43 times in the span of 11 months before carrying out the assassination attempt.\n\nGrassley's office said that it demonstrated the gunman's \"intense preparation in the months prior to his attempted assassination of the former president.\"\n\n\"He focused almost exclusively on the rifle range throughout 2024,\" Grassley's office said.\n\nIn the days following the shooting, people close to Trump, who briefly donned a white bandage on his ear, painted the image of a changed man. However, the former president rejected the notion soon thereafter.\n\n\"No, I haven't changed,\" Trump told rally attendees in St. Cloud, Minnesota, two weeks after the shooting. \"Maybe I've gotten worse, actually.

An officer is seen being hoisted onto the roof, encountering the shooter and then falling back.\n\n\"This close, bro!\" the officer yells. \"Dude, he turned around on me. He's straight up!\"\n\nThe video shows officers taking up heavy arms and race toward the building.\n\n\"This building. He's on top of this building,\" an officer calls out. \"He's got a bookbag. He's got mad s---, AR, laying down.\"\n\nAs officers stream toward the building, other officers are seen offering a boost to the rooftop.\n\n\"Next, next, next,\" an officer says in an apparent attempt to quickly get more officers into position.\n\nBy then, though, Crooks is dead.\n\n\"One in custody. AGR building south. Rooftop,\" an officer is overheard saying.\n\nLater, in the calmer aftermath, the officers questioned how a gunman was able to access a rooftop firing position fewer than 400 feet from the podium where Trump had been speaking.\n\n\"I told them, post f------ guys over here,\" one officer is heard saying. \"Why were we not on the roof?\"\n\nButler County released the footage Thursday in response to public records requests from news agencies including ABC News.\n\nOne rally spectator was killed and two injured in the assassination attempt. Trump also suffered a graze wound to his ear. A motive in the assassination attempt remains under investigation.\n\nRonald Rowe, the acting director of the Secret Service, said last week that video from that day affirmed there should've been better coverage.\n\n\"We should have had better protection for the protectee. We should have had better coverage on that roofline,\" Rowe told reporters.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate told a Senate panel last month that the investigation remains focused on motive, identifying any potential co-conspirators and building out the timeline of the shooter's actions.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shooting range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clairton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clairton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clairton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Grassley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Hills,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halloween"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/8293a39f-39bb-45c7-ad07-51bf11d80394/trump-1-gty-er-240808_1723157124102_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 839, "textEnd": 846}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 1429, "textEnd": 1436}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-08-", "textStart": 794, "textEnd": 801}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

(Scripps News)\n\nPolice in Pennsylvania have released video footage showing the chaotic moments before, during, and after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump in July.\n\nButler Township Police released 12 video clips of body-worn camera and in-car camera video Thursday to Scripps News and other news outlets in response to public records requests. The township initially denied the Scripps News request before reversing course this week.\n\nOne clip appears to show the moments a police officer realized there was an armed man on the roof near the Trump rally moments before he opened fire. The shooting on July 13 left Trump and two of his supporters wounded, and killed retired firefighter Corey Comperatore, before the Secret Service shot and killed the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\nThe video shows a Butler Township police officer being boosted by another officer to look on to the roof of the building where the gunman had taken a position.\n\nThe video released by police does not include audio during the section when the officer encountered Crooks. The video shows the officer quickly retreating from the roof and running toward his car to retrieve his gun. An in-car camera picked up the sound of eight gunshots about 40 seconds after the officer fell down from the roof.\n\nLater, the officer can be heard telling other police, \"I popped my head up here like an idiot by myself, dude. He turned around, I f***ing dropped.\" Police said in a statement that Crooks pointed his rifle at the officer, but the gunman cannot be seen from the officer's camera angle in the body-worn camera footage.\n\nThe officer is also heard suggesting that he was \"calling out\" that someone was on the roof, and asked, \"Were we all on the same frequency?\"\n\nRELATED STORY | Acting Secret Service director calls Trump assassination attempt a 'failure on multiple levels'\n\nLast week, acting Secret Service director Ronald L. Rowe Jr. acknowledged in a news conference that Secret Service countersnipers did not have access to radio traffic from local police, and likely did not know that there was an armed man on the nearby rooftop.\n\nIn other body-worn camera clips released Thursday, police can be heard expressing frustration that the area where the gunman opened fire was not better secured.\n\nOne officer standing outside the building can be heard telling another, \"f***ing told the Secret Service, post a f***ing guy over here. I told them,f***ing, at the meeting on Tuesday.\"\n\nRowe has called the Secret Service's security measures a \"failure,\" and the circumstances surrounding the shooting are the subject of several federal investigations.", "source": {"uri": "wkbw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKBW"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lori_jane_gliha@wkbw.com", "name": "Lori Jane Gliha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "brittany_freeman@wkbw.com", "name": "Brittany Freeman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scripps News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Township,_Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_township", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil township"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e53311/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fe9%2F0c%2F0c38af8c4ce3a195962f620597d8%2Fthumpshooting-police-thumb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802402", "eventUri": "eng-9802402", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 807, "textEnd": 814}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

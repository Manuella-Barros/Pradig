Dunne recounts his friendship with the late star in his new memoir, The Friday Afternoon Club: A Family Memoir, which is out on 11 June via Penguin Press, along with other memories from a childhood surrounded by famous faces. In an extract published by The Times, Dunne recalls how he received a call from his longtime friend, whom he met through his younger brother when she came over to the family\u2019s home for dinner. \u201cIt was 1976 and one day Carrie said offhandedly that she had landed a job in some science-fiction movie shooting in England,\u201d he wrote. \u201c\u2018Is there a part in it for me?\u2019 I asked, oblivious to what a normal person would say, like \u2018Congrats\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s great!\u2019 \u201cThe only one you would have been right for is being played by Mark somebody,\u201d Fisher apparently responded, referring to her co-star Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker. \u201cIt\u2019s a really stupid script and you would have turned it down, I promise.\u201d Fisher, with whom Dunne shared a flat at the time, told him she was also acting opposite \u201csome older guy named Harrison Ford\u201d, whom he realised had worked as a carpenter for his aunt, the writer Joan Didion. \u201cLike an eager puppy I\u2019d handed him nails or dug for hardware from his worn canvas toolkit,\u201d he said. \u201cIn return he would slip me one of his Marlboros, the filters of which I clipped off because that\u2019s what he did. \u201cHarrison cut me off from his endless relay of joints because his stuff was so strong that after one toke I couldn\u2019t tell the difference between a saw and a tape measure. I simply idolised the dude and hated my envy that Carrie would get to spend so much time with him.\u201d Fisher, who revealed she had a three-month affair with Ford in her 2016 memoir, grew anxious as the release date for Star Wars loomed on 25 May 1997, and called Dunne from the shoot in England in a panic over her wardrobe. \u201c\u2018You should see what they did to my hair!\u2019 she had screamed into the phone on location, usually mornings before going to set for her, four in the morning for me. \u2018I look like I\u2019m wearing two bagels over my ears.\u2019\u201d She added: \u201cAnd I\u2019m acting with an eight-foot yeti and a four-foot Brit in a rolling trash can! We shoot at s*** we can\u2019t see on green screens with ray guns that don\u2019t even have a trigger. This movie is going to be a f***ing disaster.\u201d Of course, Dunne went on to acknowledge, the film was far from a disaster, and his friendship with Fisher shifted as she shot to global fame as Princess Leia Organa, a leader of the Rebel Alliance. Fisher died aged 60 in 2016, after suffering a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles.", "summary": "<p>Late actor called up her friend Griffin Dunne and despaired over the \u2018stupid\u2019 script, he recalls in new memoir </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/carrie-fisher-star-wars-hair-griffin-dunne-b2551779.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/06/25/22/newFile-7.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/HfI2QpVR-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:06:55", "author": "Roisin O'Connor", "authors": ["Roisin O'Connor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.042}

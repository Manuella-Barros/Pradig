Key findings include:\n\n68% of respondents said outdoor time relaxes them.66% reported that it puts them in a better mood.64% mentioned it helps clear their minds.\n\nConversely, spending excessive time indoors can lead to negative emotions:\n\n38% reported feelings of depression.33% experienced anxiousness.32% felt lonely.\n\nFifty-eight percent of respondents admitted they become stir-crazy after spending too much time indoors, with the average threshold being 10.5 hours.\n\nPositive Impact on Mental Health\n\nOverall, outdoor trips are positively impacting American lives.

These activities offer a unique blend of adventure and relaxation, providing an escape from the stresses of daily life. RV travel allows you to explore new destinations at your own pace, fostering a sense of freedom and flexibility.\n\nCamping, whether in an RV or a tent, immerses you in nature, promoting a deeper connection with the environment. These experiences can be particularly beneficial for mental health, as they encourage mindfulness, reduce stress, and create opportunities for family bonding and social interaction.\n\nFor Mental Health Awareness Month and beyond, RVshare encourages everyone to incorporate outdoor therapy into their daily lives and travel plans, underscoring the profound benefits of connecting with nature.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Tncen Loffredi Travel Mental Health Health Experience Stress (biology) Relaxation (psychology) Psychology Social Psychology Primate Behavior Mental States Psychological

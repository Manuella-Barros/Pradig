The last remaining player the Lions intend to sign to an extension this summer is quarterback Jared Goff.\n\nBut it's not clear when Goff and the Lions may agree to that extension.\n\nWhile appearing on 97.1 The Ticket, Detroit general manager Brad Holmes didn't provide a deadline or target date for Goff's extension. But Holmes did stress how vital coming to an agreement with the quarterback is for the organization.\n\n\"He's earned an extension. It's important, it's a high priority for us,\" said Holmes. \"Both sides are working really, really hard. These things just take time.\"\n\nGoff will enter the final year of his current contract with the Lions in 2024. He will become a free agent next March.\n\nThe Lions don't have to sign Goff this offseason. They will have the opportunity to sign him before free agency next spring. The possibility of franchise tagging Goff will also be on the table.\n\nBut Holmes made it rather clear that's not the organization's intention. He also expressed a quiet confidence that the Lions and Goff will have an agreement before the season.\n\nIn three seasons with Detroit, Goff has posted a 24-23-1 record. But half of those wins came during 2023 when Goff led the Lions to their first division title in 30 years and their first NFC championship game appearance since 1991.\n\nGoff threw for 4,575 yards and 30 touchdowns in 2023. He averaged 7.6 yards per pass and had 12 interceptions.\n\nGoff has received questions on a potential extension in Detroit since the team's heartbreaking defeat in the NFC championship game. But Goff has done his best not to address his negotiations with the Lions too directly.\n\nHe kept the same approach during an exclusive interview with Heavy Sports on April 23, 2024.\n\n\"Just play it by ear,\" said Goff of his thought process on the contract discussions.\n\nThe quarterback added that he is allowing his representation and the team to engage in those talks.\n\n\"There have been discussions, but I'll let them do their jobs.\"\n\nAlthough it will still come down to the actual offer, Holmes' message that Goff has earned an extension should put the quarterback a little at ease. After the Lions experienced their best season in more than 30 years, it's hard to disagree that Goff deserves a raise.\n\nGoff has played exceptionally well over the past two seasons. In 34 games, he has tossed 59 touchdowns versus only 19 interceptions. He's also averaged 7.6 yards per pass and 11.4 yards per completion with a 98.6 passer rating.\n\nThe Lions went 21-13 in those 34 games.\n\nThe expectation is Detroit will make Goff one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league with his extension. ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported on April 14 that Goff could make up to $50 million per season on his new contract.\n\nGoff's current deal has a $33.5 million average annual salary.\n\nIf the Lions are able to complete an extension for Goff as Holmes hopes, then Detroit will have locked up its three cornerstones on offense -- Goff, St. Brown and Sewell.\n\nThe Lions will have more young players ready for extensions as early as next season, particularly on defense. But with Goff, St. Brown and Sewell, Detroit will have three key players to the team's resurgence signed to contracts that don't expire until the end of the decade.\n\nThat appears to have been Holmes' plan since before this offseason even began.\n\n\"It's not something that we waited until after the season to start planning for. We've been preparing for a while,\" Holmes said. \"In a perfect world, we would have at all three done. Bang, bang, bang.\n\n\"But these things kind of take a while, especially with the quarterback market. But I do have faith that it's going to get done.\"\n\nThe St. Brown and Sewell extensions combined were worth more than $232 million.

General manger Brad Holmes said on Thursday, Goff has \"earned\" it.\n\n\"It's a high priority for us and both sides are working really, really hard,\" Holmes told 97.1 The Ticket on Thursday. \"These things just take time, you know.\"\n\nHolmes said the Lions have been working on a new deal for Goff for a while. Detroit recently signed two other key pieces of their offense, tackle Penei Sewell and wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, to large multi-year extensions this offseason.\n\n\"In a perfect world, we'd have had all three of them done bang, bang, bang, you know, but these things just kind of take a while, especially with the quarterback market,\" Holmes said. \"But I do have faith that it's gonna get done.\"\n\nCoach Dan Campbell called an extension for Goff a priority at the owners' meetings in March.\n\nLast season, Goff helped the Lions win a division title for the first time in 30 years and two playoff games in one of the best seasons of his career. He finished second in the NFL in passing yards (4,575) and fourth in touchdown passes (30).\n\nSince joining the Lions as part of the trade that sent quarterback Matthew Stafford to the Los Angeles Rams in 2021, Goff has thrown for the fourth-most yards (12,258) and seventh-most touchdowns (78) of any quarterback in the NFL over that stretch.\n\nWith Detroit and Goff, it's always been a matter of when and not if. Additionally, the matter of \"how long\" will be as important as the price tag attached to it.\n\nDetroit's offseason was busy before it ever started. The Lions entered 2024 with plans on getting something done with two stars on rookie deals: St. Brown and Sewell. Both of those players signed extensions with the team before the NFL Draft. The Lions also entered 2024, even before their playoff run, with plans to extend Goff. So it's not surprising to hear Holmes say signing Goff is a priority or that both sides are \"working really, really hard\" to get something done. Nor is it necessarily a surprise to hear him say he's confident a deal will get done.\n\nAt the same time, Goff's contract is far more complicated than what Detroit was dealing with in terms of both St. Brown and Sewell - two guys under the age of 23. Goff, who turns 30 in mid-October, has had a terrific three-year run in Detroit and has \"earned\" a new deal per Holmes. How big of a new deal -- and for how long -- will be the ultimate question.\n\nGoff's next contract is expected to flirt with $50 million annually -- a number currently reserved for Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert, Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts. Additionally, Trevor Lawrence, Tua Tagovailoa and Dak Prescott could all be looking at new extensions.\n\nThe market is going to dictate the terms of Goff's next deal. Holmes was clear about that. How far along Detroit waits before getting something done, though, will be an interesting question. The Lions drafted former Tennessee QB Hendon Hooker in the third round last season. And while the 26-year-old sat out last year rehabbing a college knee injury, he's expected to be ready for camp this year. Detroit's future plans clearly revolve around Goff as the starter. It's just a matter of how long that window will be. -- Nick Baumgardner, senior writer", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_baumgardner@theathletic.com", "name": "Nick Baumgardner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "amos_morale_iii@theathletic.com", "name": "Amos Morale Iii", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Holmes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendon_Hooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hendon Hooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Herbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Herbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Hurts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Hurts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tua_Tagovailoa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tua Tagovailoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Volunteers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Volunteers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/11/29165507/GettyImages-1810031709-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553624", "eventUri": "eng-9553624", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

There's still plenty of time to get a deal done with Goff, and it's only May. But the clock is ticking, slowly but surely, and when dealing in the kind of years and money you are with a quarterback it's automatically a complicated negotiation.\n\nThe Lions would probably prefer to get a deal done fairly quickly, before some other quarterbacks get their new deals this offseason and drive Goff's market value up. Goff's side would surely rather wait a bit, and see what happens with those other quarterbacks.\n\nLions general manager Brad Holmes was on \"Costa and Jansen with Heather\" on 97.1 The Ticket Thursday morning. Goff's contract extension was an easy, and practically automatic, topic.\n\n\"Yeah, look, first and foremost, he's earned an extension,\" Holmes said. \"It's important, it's a high priority for us. Both sides are working really, really hard. These things just take time......The whole process of budgeting and preparation and all that that goes into it, in a perfect world we'd have had all three of them done bang, bang, bang. But these things take a while, especially with the quarterback market, but I do have faith that it's gonna get done.\"\n\nHolmes was then asked what specifically makes a quarterback contract more complicated.\n\n\"There's some uniqueness there in some different areas, but still, he's performed at a high level. You look at what the results have been, and we still feel good about where he's at,\" Holmes said. \"He's not one of the guys that was recently drafted and all that stuff. But that's even better because we even have more of a body of work to examine and analyze.\"\n\n\"All those things, you look at all of it. But, again, we've done a lot of work -- again, both sides have -- we've done a lot of work, dialogue's been consistent. There hasn't been just dead periods and all that stuff.....You gotta think about what can we do now, and what are the impacts on the future, as well. And we look at all of it, because we said all along, when Dan and I first got here, we're looking to build sustained success, and that's still the goal.\"\n\nGoff is of course entering the final year of his current contract, with a $32.3 million cap hit (ninth-highest among quarterbacks for 2024 right now). The top of the quarterback market is now above $50 million per year, and Goff has a case to ask for somewhere around that $50 million a year mark.\n\n\"He's earned an extension.\"\n\n\"It's a high priority for us.\"\n\n\"Both sides are working really, really hard.\"\n\n\"These things just take time.\"\n\n\"We're looking to build sustained success.\"\n\nNothing Holmes said on the radio Thursday morning about the contract talks with Goff was particularly enlightening, as could've and should've been expected.\n\nSavvy front offices don't negotiate through the media.

The veteran passer is expected to command a hefty extension given the current market for quarterbacks, and the two sides have not yet reached a deal.\n\nSpeaking Thursday on 97.1 The Ticket, Holmes expressed optimism that the two sides will eventually come to a deal. He did not provide a timeline for the completion of the extension, but stated that the team has faith that it will get done.\n\n\"Yeah, look, first and foremost, he's earned an extension. It's important, it's a high priority for us and both sides are working really, really hard,\" Holmes said. \"These things just take time. Just working on, not only working on trying to get an extension done with him, but Penei and Saint, that's not something that we waited until after the season to start planning for. The whole process of budgeting and preparation and all that that goes into it, in a perfect world we'd have had all three of them done bang, bang, bang. But these things take a while, especially with the quarterback market, but I do have faith that it's gonna get done.\"\n\nGoff has played at a high level throughout the last two campaigns, as the organization has been on a tear. After a slow start to the 2022 season, they finished on a 7-2 run to earn their first winning season of Holmes and Dan Campbell's tenure.\n\nThey continued that success last season with a 12-5 finish and run to the NFC Championship game. Now, with Goff playing among the best quarterbacks in the league statistically, the Lions will likely have to dedicate a large chunk of their cap space to retaining him.\n\nHolmes explained to hosts Jim Costa and Jon Jansen the complexities that come with negotiating an extension with a player like Goff, who is coming off an expensive contract that he signed previously with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\n\"I mean there's some uniqueness in some different areas. Still, he's performed at a high level. You look at what the results have been and we still feel good about where he's at,\" Holmes explained. \"He's not one of the guys that was recently drafted and all that stuff, but that's even better because we have a body of work to examine and analyze. All those things, you look at all of it, but again we've done a lot of work, both sides have. We've done a lot of work, dialogue has been consistent. There hasn't been dead periods and all that stuff.\"\n\nHolmes also reaffirmed that the negotiations with Goff have been factored into the Lions' long-term plans, which revolve around creating sustainable success within the organization for the future.\n\n\"Again, I do have faith through looking at all the numbers,\" Holmes stated. \"You've got to think about, what can you do know and what are the impacts on the future as well. We look at all of it because we've said all along, when Dan and I first got here, we're looking to build sustained success and that's still the goal.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WXYT-FM", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WXYT-FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ford Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Costa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Costa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2400,h_1350,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_lions/01hxeqyy2det1p5w0qbx.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553624", "eventUri": "eng-9553624", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

It's still only May, two-plus weeks before Memorial Day, and the concern level shouldn't really ramp up until training camp is here in late-July. Even then, Week 1 would stand as a harder deadline to have the deal done.\n\nOn Thursday morning, general manager Brad Holmes used a lot of words but really said nothing about where contract talks are with Goff. As expected, which is fine. It's not meaningful either direction in regard to how negotiations are going. But the clock is slowly ticking, and that shouldn't be completely set aside.\n\nThe whole vibe around the Lions and Goff's agent coming together on a long-term deal has been \"when, not if.\" Holmes acknowledged the added complication of a quarterback contract, with all it entails and all the residual implications on continuing to build the roster.\n\nIt's hard to find anyone who thinks Goff won't be the Lions' quarterback for a few years beyond 2024. But could that change?\n\nOn Wednesday's episode of \"The Daily Ticket\" on 97.1 The Ticket, Jeff Riger talked about the situation with Goff.\n\n\"So, go back a couple weeks when the draft was here. Wednesday before the draft, Penei Sewell, Amon-Ra St. Brown get contract extensions. Every Lions fan figured, 'Goff is next', icing on the cake.\"\n\nRiger noted the immediate report from ESPN's Adam Schefter, after the news of the new deals for St. Brown and Sewell, that a deal was not \"imminent\" for Goff and \"no deal was close\" at that time. Since then, as Riger mentioned, we hadn't heard anything before Holmes' radio appearance on Thursday. And, again, Holmes simply hit all the right notes without offering anything insightful.\n\nRiger said he was doing a show a week ago or so, and he was asked a question regarding the Lions and Goff.\n\n\"Who needs who more?\"\n\nRiger continued, with his answer to that question.\n\n\"Jared Goff, does he need the Lions more? Or do the Lions need Goff more? What's the answer? What's the first thing that pops in your head?....When I hear this question, when I was asked this question, the first thing I thought was, 'Goff needs the Lions more.\"\n\nRiger rightly praised Holmes for what he's done to build the Lions roster, pointing to Goff having a unique situation that would not exist anywhere else right now. Any other team with a roster as good as the Lions has their quarterback.\n\nRiger pointed to how Goff may not get the credit he deserves, so maybe the Lions need him more. Then Riger stretched to a different idea to ultimately land back on Goff needing the Lions more.\n\n\"Or maybe, and we've not even acknowledged this....we've not even thought about this...Maybe Brad Holmes has zero, zero inclination of re-signing Jared Goff.\"\n\nRiger acknowledged Holmes' role in the Rams drafting Goff, and trading for him when he became Lions' general manager. But the proverbial elephant in the room is Hendon Hooker, who was a third-round pick last year and will have a chance to show himself this offseason.\n\n\"Is there a chance that Brad Holmes has no desire, at all, to give Jared Goff big money?\", Riger wondered.\n\nAs unlikely as it is, the Lions could franchise tag Goff in 2025 and Riger mentioned that. They have that two years of potential contract control, at which point Goff would be 31 years old.\n\nIt's certainly different to suggest the Lions and Brad Holmes have no intention to extend Goff. Even as he suggested it and talked it out, Riger wasn't quite all-in on the warm take. But the question somehow doesn't feel that outlandish on the surface.\n\nHere's that full episode of \"The Daily Ticket\".

They gave star wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown a monster four-year extension and made offensive tackle Penei Sewell the highest-paid offensive lineman in the NFL. Several Lions were made very happy this offseason, but what about the quarterback?\n\nJared Goff has one more year remaining on his contract, and CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones reported back in January that both sides are \"very interested\" in an extension. However, one has not yet come to fruition while his teammates have had success at the negotiating table. During a recent interview on WXYT-FM (97.1), Lions general manager Brad Holmes addressed Goff's contract situation.\n\n\"First and foremost, he's earned an extension,\" Holmes said, via the Detroit Free Press. \"It's important, it's a high priority for us and both sides are working really, really hard and these things just take time.\"\n\nIt's understandable why the quarterback extension is the one that's the most complicated.

In 2023, the Lions won their first division title since 1993 and their first playoff game since 1991. Detroit tied a franchise record for wins with 12 and set a record for most 30-point games with nine. Goff completed a career-high 67.3% of his passes for 4,575 yards, 30 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in the regular season.

In a pre-draft interview with Heavy Sports, he kept that up.\n\n\"Just play it by ear. \"There have been discussions, but I'll let them do their jobs,\" Goff said.\n\nThe longer the Lions wait to extend Goff, the more expensive the deal will be. He's got a case to surpass deals that have been done or will be done for other quarterbacks this offseason. It may come down to the length of the deal, guaranteed money and potential outs for the team, which is not breaking news but was recently reiterated by Ryan Ermanni of Woodward Sports.\n\nFor his part, and for whatever it's worth, St. Brown recently told 97.1 The Ticket he knows Goff's extension is \"going to get done.\" It does feel like a matter of time. and there is time before the season starts.\n\nSpotrac has freshly pointed to four-years, $160 million as the foundation for the discussion on Goff's contract extension, with their calculated market value lower than that: four years, $153.4 million ($38.4 million per year). If the core, surface value of an offer doesn't start with a '4' in per year average, that's presumably a non-starter for Goff's agent.\n\nIt easily follows that the biggest post-draft offseason question for the Lions is Goff's contract extension, and Tyler Sullivan of CBS Sports simply pointed it out.\n\n\"When will the Lions extend Jared Goff?\"\n\n\"This feels like more \"when\" than \"if' as Goff and the Lions reportedly have mutual interest in signing an extension. Goff is entering the final year of his deal and getting an extension done can get Detroit focused on what could prove to be a special season in 2024.\"\n\nIt's only May, days before Lions' rookie minicamp right now. It's a complicated negotiation when you're dealing in big money over a multi-year commitment, even if both sides clearly want to stay together. But the more days pass before Goff's deal is announced the more questions there may be, and those questions will get more intense if a deal isn't done when training camp is here.\n\nThere is plenty of time for the deal with Goff to get to the finish line, and the idea it's a formality remains. But the clock is ticking, and that shouldn't be ignored.", "source": {"uri": "sidelionreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SideLion Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WXYT-FM", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WXYT-FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4086,h_2298,x_0,y_36/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/53/01hx9v62sqp4m348v3n8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553624", "eventUri": "eng-9553624", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Lions quarterback Jared Goff is dressed more like a Fortune 500 CEO than starting NFL quarterback rocking a maroon blazer, white dress shirt, khaki pants and brown loafers.\n\nThrough a partnership with Jared Jewelers, Goff has just surprised some of the Lions biggest fans with the same Breitling watches that the quarterback gifted the team's offensive linemen with during the season. We sit in a cigar bar where cameras have replaced smoke for the afternoon as Goff turned the historic venue into his temporary office for media members.\n\nFor all the mutual love between Detroit and Goff, the former No. 1 pick still faces an uncertain future with the Lions. Goff is heading into the final season of his current deal, and the quarterback offers a five-word philosophy when the discussion turns to his future. Could a long-term contract get ironed out before the season starts?\n\n\"Just play it by ear,\" Goff explains during an exclusive interview with Heavy Sports on April 23, 2024.\n\nThe quarterback continues with his thought process about the ongoing negotiations with the Lions. Goff admitted that there have been contract discussions but prefers to let his agent and the Lions front office \"do their jobs.\"\n\n\"There have been discussions, but I'll let them do their jobs,\" Goff added.\n\nIn the coming days, Detroit will break the attendance record for the NFL draft. Goff will share the stage with Detroit legends like Eminem, Barry Sanders and Calvin Johnson to officially kickoff the 2024 NFL draft. Lions fans have been starving for a winner, and Goff, head coach Dan Campbell and company have obliged.\n\nDetroit was two quarters away from making the Super Bowl, before the San Francisco 49ers' second half comeback to notch a 34-31 victory in the NFC Championship. Goff emphasizes that he wants to remain in Detroit and \"win championships.\"\n\n\"Just want to win,\" Goff on his goals for the future. \"Just want to win. Want to win championships. Want to bring a Super Bowl to Detroit, and hopefully play here for a long time.\"\n\nThe Lions signed star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown to a contract extension ahead of the draft, but the wait is still on for Goff. ESPN's Adam Schefter reported on April 24 that \"no deal is close at this time\" between Detroit and Goff.\n\nThe loss to the Niners is still painful, even months after the heartbreak occurred. Goff makes it clear that the Lions were not as surprised as the rest of the world was about their deep NFL playoff run. This made the NFC Championship loss even more disappointing.\n\n\"It obviously didn't go our way,\" Goff said of the NFC Championship loss to the 49ers. \"We played well for a long part of it, but didn't play well for another part of it. The Niners earned it and beat us.\n\n\"But yeah, we were able to make it that far. Disappointing that we weren't able to finish off with a Super Bowl win, really,\" Goff added. \"I know that people were surprised that we went that deep in the playoffs, but we weren't. This next year certainly will be about winning the Super Bowl, and finding our best path there and putting in the time to get there.\"\n\nAfter a bumpy end to his tenure with the Los Angeles Rams, Detroit has embraced Goff as the team's QB1. Goff threw for 4,575 yards, 30 touchdowns and 12 interceptions while completing 67.3% of his passes in 2023.\n\nPrior to the draft, Goff surprised people like Lions security director Elton Moore (who is retiring in May) with an epic Breitling watch. Leon DeFever's family has been going to Lions games since 1934 and was also one of several fans Goff surprised with a timepiece. Additionally, Goff and Jared Jewelers presented the Detroit-based non-profit Give Merit with a $50,000 donation.\n\n\"Just the fans care so much, I'd argue they care as much as anywhere, if not more,\" Goff remarked on Detroit fans. \"You catch both sides of that though. It's good and at times they will get on you about it. Which is appropriate and all fair, but it's a lot of fun.\n\n\"It really is [fun] to play in front of fans that really care as much as they do. It's been a lot of fun to be a part of. \"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_adams@heavy.com", "name": "Jonathan Adams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Detroit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barry Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eminem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1968714051-e1715090236527.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553624", "eventUri": "eng-9553624", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 2242, "textEnd": 2250}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Fans and pundits have taken turns celebrating the turnaround over the last two seasons, but the quarterback has yet to see an official endorsement in the form of an extension.\n\nWhile the wait for an extension will continue, the general manager behind the wait has at least given verbal vindication to the quarterback. General manager Brad Holmes said his piece on Goff's future in comments made via the Detroit Free Press and NBC Sports on Thursday.\n\n\"First and foremost, he's earned an extension,\" Holmes said. \"It's important, it's a high priority for us and both sides are working really, really hard and these things just take time.\"\n\nJared Goff is now in the final year of a contract dating back to 2019, following his Super Bowl performance with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHe was 25 years old when his contract began. He will now begin the final year of the contract at the age of 30. He had been playing on a four-year extension for $134 million since being traded by the Rams for Matthew Stafford after the 2020 season.\n\nJared Goff sets another major career record following separation from Sean McVay\n\nSome have argued that Jared Goff hasn't proven himself to be better without Sean McVay than with him. However, at least in one statistical category, the quarterback has proven that he can succeed away from McVay.\n\nWhile the Detroit Lions still have yet to get deeper in the playoffs with Goff than the Rams did, the quarterback can trumpet his career-best accuracy in 2023.

General manager Brad Holmes typically declines to comment during ongoing talks, but he offered an optimistic update regarding the conversations between the two sides during a Thursday morning interview with 97.1-FM.\n\n\"Look, first and foremost, he's earned an extension,\" Holmes said. \"It's important, it's a high priority for us, and both sides are working really, really hard. These things just take time. Not only trying to get an extension done with him, but, like you said, Penei and Saint, it's not something we waited until after the season to start planning for. The whole process of budgeting and preparation and all that that kind of goes into it, we've been preparing for a while. Look, in a perfect world, we'd have all three of them done, bang, bang, bang, but these things kind of take a while, especially with the quarterback market. But I do have faith that it's going to get done.\n\nHolmes further added that the dialogue between the two sides has been steady throughout the offseason.\n\n\"There hasn't been dead periods and all that stuff,\" he said.\n\nOne of the first moves Holmes made after becoming Detroit's GM in 2021 was trading for Goff. The No. 1 pick in the 2016 NFL Draft was part of the return package when longtime Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was shipped to the Los Angeles Rams. And while Goff went through some early struggles as the franchise entered a near-total rebuild that year, he's rebounded to have two of the best seasons of his career in 2022 and '23.\n\nDuring that two-year stretch, he completed better than 66% of his throws for 9,013 yards, 59 touchdowns and 19 interceptions. He's posted a 21-13 regular-season record as a starter, leading the team to its first division title and first postseason victories in three decades last season.\n\n\"You look at what the results have been and we still feel good about where he's at,\" Holmes said. \"...We've said all along that when (coach) Dan (Campbell) and I first got here, we're looking to build sustained success. That's still the goal.\"\n\nHere are some of the other items discussed by Holmes in the 15-minute interview:\n\n\u25b6 The team's biggest positional overhaul this offseason has been at cornerback, where the Lions added Carlton Davis III in a trade, signed Amik Robertson in free agency and drafted Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw Jr. with the team's first two selections. The on-paper improvements seem obvious and Holmes feels the changes should be felt throughout the entire defensive backfield.\n\n\"We expect a vast improvement in the secondary, as a whole,\" Holmes said. \"We feel like we have a lot of guys now that have a good mix of proven play time, we have a good mix of guys that have versatility at multiple spots, and we have a good mix of youthful future with young guys. So, we really like our mix that we have. Like I said, it's going to be a very, very competitive room.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how the depth chart at safety shakes out. Kerby Joseph and Ifeatu Melifonwu remain the presumptive starters, while there's been more subtraction than addition with the remaining options this offseason, following the departures of C.J. Gardner-Johnson and Tracy Walker. Holmes did partially restock the cupboard this week, agreeing to bring back C.J. Moore after the NFL lifted his suspension for violating the league's gambling policy.\n\n\u25b6 Unlike cornerback, the Lions have invested little in wide receiver additions this offseason. Prior to the impending announcement of the team's undrafted free-agent signings, the only new addition has been Tre'Quan Smith, who appeared in just one game and didn't record a catch last season. That wouldn't seem to offset the loss of Josh Reynolds, who accepted a multi-year contract from Denver in free agency.\n\nAsked about his confidence in the team's depth at the position, Holmes expressed confidence, highlighting the continuing development of Jameson Williams and 2023 seventh-round selection Antoine Green, as well as the re-signing of Donovan Peoples-Jones, whom the Lions acquired at the trade deadline last season.\n\n\"He was a big-time, core player for the Cleveland Browns before we traded for him,\" Holmes said. \"We traded for him, and, you know, the guy comes in late and he doesn't really know the offense. So, you haven't really seen Peoples-Jones. And we all get into the recency bias of, well, what's Peoples-Jones going to do? No, Peoples-Jones can play. He does provide an element of being able to play on the outside and being a contested-catch guy and being able to do multiple things.\"\n\nPeoples-Jones, who starred at Michigan before he was drafted by the Browns in 2020, is two years removed from catching 61 passes for 839 yards for his former team.\n\nAs for Williams, whom the Lions moved up 20 spots in the first round to draft in 2022, Holmes is encouraged by the way the speedster finished last season.\n\n\"We have high hopes for him and we like where he's at, at this point,\" Holmes said. \"We know he's going to continue to get better.\"\n\nWilliams had just one catch in nine games as a rookie, and 13 grabs for 195 yards through his first nine appearances last season before snagging 11 catches for 159 yards in his final three appearances.\n\n\u25b6 Holmes was aggressive in last month's draft, trading up four times for targets, including a five-spot climb to score Arnold in the first round. With that deal, pre-existing trade-value charts showed the Lions paid a premium to get a player they coveted.\n\nHolmes acknowledged the team does consult trade charts as part of its decision-making process, while countering they won't hesitate to give up extra to get a player they truly want, particularly one such as Arnold, who they didn't expect to be within reach entering the event.\n\n\"The trade chart can't predict, let's call them wild situations and chaos,\" Holmes said. \"And the trade chart doesn't know which player you are trading to get. That's when you kind of throw the chart out the window. ...That's why we always go back to looking at players over positions. We use the trade chart, and again, it's a good tool, but there are times you have to understand (it) for what it is.\"\n\n\u25b6 Holmes seemingly cares even less about trade-chart values in the later rounds, where he prioritizes landing targets, such as offensive tackle Giovanni Manu.\n\n\"Look, we try to do the best we can in terms of assessing the value and placing the right value on him, but sometimes when you get to Day 3 of the draft, and you see what's available and what's left and how it's fell, we just kind of got in the mode of, 'Let's just get the guys that we want,'\" Holmes said. \"So, we didn't want to kind of take the risk of let's just sit back, wait and be patient and if he's there, he's there, if he's not, he's not. No, we want these guys. That's kind of what went into trading up to get him.\"\n\nHolmes called Manu's upside \"enormous,\" and said while others might be caught up in the competition level he faced at the University of British Columbia, the general manager was encouraged by what he saw watching that film.\n\n\"It's not about who he's going against,\" Holmes said. \"We know who he's going against, but, for one, he's doing what he's supposed to do versus the guys that he was going against. You see him burying multiple guys at the second level, at the line of scrimmage. You saw him playing with physicality, with tenacity and finish. Regardless of the defensive end that was rushing against him, it's no, look at his feet, look at his bend, look at his ability to change direction. And, again, he's doing what he was supposed to be doing at that level.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Goff has been prolific in Detroit over the last three seasons, leading the team to their first real playoff success in more than 30 years. The Lions have already handed out record extensions to WR Amon-Ra St. Brown and OT Penei Sewell.\n\nJared Goff has had a tumultuous career since being selected first overall in the 2016 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams mortgaged their future in order to select the University of California signal caller, only for Goff to produce an all-time porous rookie season. The team then hired offensive wunderkind Sean McVay as their head coach, and he turned Goff into a two-time Pro Bowler and got the Rams to Super Bowl LIII.\n\nAfter that meteoric ascendance, Goff plateaued, ultimately getting traded to the Detroit Lions in a blockbuster trade that landed Matthew Stafford in Los Angeles. Stafford won the Super Bowl in his first season out West, and Goff was seen as a mere placeholder until the Lions found their quarterback of the future.\n\nSince then, a funny thing has happened: Goff is suddenly good again. Playing with an elite WR1 in Amon-Ra St. Brown and a brilliant offensive coordinator in Ben Johnson, Goff has recaptured his Pro Bowl form. He led the Lions to their first NFC Championship Game appearance since 1991 last year, ultimately falling just shy of the team's first ever Super Bowl appearance.\n\nWith Goff establishing himself as the leader of the franchise, Lions' general manager Brad Holmes is making it clear the team will do whatever is necessary to keep the quarterback in Motown for the foreseeable future. Speaking on 97.1 The Ticket, Holmes said that Goff \"has earned\" a massive extension.\n\n\"[An extension for Goff] is a high priority for us and both sides are working really, really hard. These things just take time, you know.\"\n\nThe team has already handed out market-setting deals to St. Brown and offensive tackle Penei Sewell this offseason, so signing Goff to a contract commensurate with his talent will bog down the cap sheet even further. However, the Lions are in prime position to compete for a Lombardi trophy for the next few seasons, and being frugal now would only harm the team's championship aspirations.\n\nRelated Lions Hand 1st-Team All-Pro Deal To Make Him NFL's Highest-Paid WR Detroit is continuing to embrace its new era and aims to contend for years to come with their dynamic offense. Goff Has Been Prolific In Detorit The QB ranked top-five in passing yards and touchdowns in 2023\n\nLast month, Goff called the trade that sent him to Detroit the \"best thing\" that had ever happened to him.\n\nIt's not hard to see why he'd be signing the organization's praises, as head coach Dan Campbell and company have nurtured Goff back to top form while instilling a winning culture in a city that's been desperate for sustained success from their teams.\n\nGoff has been terrific in his three-year tenure with the Lions, posting a completion rate above 65% and a passer rating above 90 in each of his three years in Detroit. He was even better last year, ranking second in the NFL in passing yards (4,575) and fourth in touchdown passes (30).\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: Since joining the Lions in 2021, Goff has thrown for the fourth-most yards (12,258) and seventh-most touchdowns (78) of any quarterback in the NFL.\n\nHe earned his first Pro Bowl nod since 2018 back in 2022, and he continued his growth as a passer last season, crossing the 30 touchdown threshold for only the second time in his career. It's been quite a turnaround in Detroit after Los Angeles included him as a \"salary dump\" in the Stafford trade.\n\nThere should be no doubt that Goff, St. Brown, tight end Sam LaPorta, and running back Jahmyr Gibbs are the offensive core that the Lions will build around in the present and future. Just last season, that group had the NFC champs on the ropes at halftime of the NFC Championship Game (the Lions were leading 24-7), though the Lions eventually fell to the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nWith the experience they've gained from that playoff run, the Lions should be on the shortlist of Super Bowl favorites going into the 2024 season. Assuming Goff and the Lions work out a long-term extension, both he and the team should be set up for a successful future.\n\nSource: 97.1 The Ticket\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.

Mike Payton of AtoZ Sports predicted that Cade Peterson, a standout from Division 2 Grand Valley State, has the chance to \"shock everyone\" and earn a spot on the team.\n\nPeterson doesn't have a spot with the team just yet, earning only an invite to minicamp to throw passes to the team's rookie pass-catchers. But Payton noted that past players have gone from minicamp invite to the roster, including Eastern Michigan wide receiver Dylan Drummond who landed on the practice squad last year and appeared in one game.\n\nPayton noted that Peterson comes into rookie minicamp with a strong resume, having been a finalist for the Harlon Hill award -- Division 2's version of the Heisman Trophy -- two times. Peterson threw for 7,231 yards with 67 touchdowns and 26 interceptions during his time at Grand Valley State, earning a reputation for his big arm.\n\n\"When you watch him throw on film, one of the things you'll see is that he drops the ball right into the bucket a lot,\" Payton wrote. \"He's got good depth perception out there. You don't see a lot of over or under throws. The ball just finds it's way to it's man. There were some risky throws that wound up paying off, but for the most part, he's sharp.\"\n\nPeterson's strong mind and \"good eye for the game\" could also give him an advantage with a team that places a high value o more cerebral quarterbacks, Payton added.\n\n\"The Lions have shown that they like having players like that on the team,\" he wrote. \"David Blough, Tim Boyle, Nate Sudfeld and Teddy Bridgewater all have that same thing in common. They're player/coach type players that have good football minds.\"\n\nIf he makes a strong impression, Peterson could earn the third/emergency quarterback spot this season.\n\nWhile the Lions could have some work to solidify the bottom of their quarterback depth chart, the team is aiming to cement Goff at the top. General manager Brad Holmes said he is confident that the team can reach a long-term extension with Goff this summer, with both sides working toward a deal that will keep him in Detroit for the near future.\n\n\"First and foremost, he's earned an extension,\" Holmes said Thursday in an interview with WXYT-FM. \"It's important, it's a high priority for us and both sides are working really, really hard and these things just take time.\"\n\nThe Lions already reached long-term deals with receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and right tackle Penei Sewell, and Holmes said they planned for Goff to be the third major deal.\n\n\"The whole process of budgeting and preparation and all that, that kind of goes into it, we've been preparing for a while,\" Holmes said. \"And look, in a perfect world, we'd have had all three of them done, bang, bang, bang, but these things just kind of take a while, especially with the quarterback market. But I do have faith that it's going to get done.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathan_dougherty@heavy.com", "name": "Nathan Dougherty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Valley_State_Lakers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Valley State Lakers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Michigan_Eagles_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Michigan Eagles football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blough", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Blough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Sudfeld", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nate Sudfeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Holmes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WXYT-FM", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WXYT-FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Bridgewater", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teddy Bridgewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1766002796-copy-2.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553624", "eventUri": "eng-9553624", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 452991266, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 22, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 22}}}

However, he's inherited a mess and now has to readjust the lineup and the coaching staff to remain competitive.\n\n3 difficult decisions for Toronto Maple Leafs after Sheldon Keefe's firing\n\n#1. Move on from Ilya Samsonov\n\nIn his locker room press conference, netminder Ilya Samsonov discussed how his one-year deal with the Maple Leafs has weighed on his mind all season and how he wants more stability (i.e., a more extended contract) next time around.\n\nAlthough everyone wants job security, Samsonov will not find it in Toronto. He received a $3.5 million contract last summer after going through the arbitration process.\n\nWith a chance to prove his worth, Samsonov struggled all season, earning a demotion to the minors, only getting his job back when rookie netminder Joseph Woll got injured.\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Samsonov crashed and burned, losing all four games to the Boston Bruins, while Woll won both of his starts and saved the Maple Leafs' season for a couple of extra games.\n\nEven though Samsonov would love to come back, the Maple Leafs need to move on and find a bona fide number-one goalie who can get the job done. Considering how cash-strapped Treliving will be, he must find Woll's partner through the trade market.\n\n#2. Strip John Tavares of captaincy\n\nJohn Tavares grew up in Mississauga, Ontario, part of the greater Toronto metropolitan area. As the top pick in the 2009 entry draft, he spent nine seasons with the New York Islanders before coming home in 2018.\n\nAfter one season, the Maple Leafs management put the \"C\" on his sweater, and he's been team captain for five seasons now. How many combined division titles and playoff series have Toronto won during his tenure? Two.\n\nIf we are being realistic, their only division win came during the realigned 2020-21 season when the Maple Leafs were the top team in a weak Canadian Division. They then blew a 3-1 first-round lead to Montreal.\n\nEven though the team has won at least 35 games in every season under Tavares' leadership, the club has won a single playoff series and is 16-21 overall, including losing three consecutive Game 7s.\n\nHistorically, it wouldn't be the first time someone has lost their captaincy. Still, with Tavares playing in the final season of his deal and unlikely to return, it may be time to move in a different direction regarding team leadership.\n\n#3. Trade Mitch Marner\n\nMitch Marner expressed his desire to remain with the Maple Leafs, saying that the team is treated like \"Gods\" in the community. Despite his public statements, Marner's time in Toronto may be nearing an end.\n\nAlthough he controls his future and can axe any deal presented to him, it will be up to Treliving to inform the player that he won't be coming back when his contract expires in 2025. His best option would be to accept a trade before becoming a free agent.\n\nBy not moving this summer, Marner's future will dominate the headlines all season and will most likely hamper his performance, possibly putting a dent in his market value with a subpar campaign in 2024-25.\n\nEven though breaking up the core four will be difficult, doing so today and not tomorrow will be the only thing that keeps Toronto competitive in the upcoming season. Ultimately, it all starts with Marner, who has the most trade value.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_gagne@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ryan Gagne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Keefe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheldon Keefe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Treliving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Treliving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Woll", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Woll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Islanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Islanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Toronto_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greater Toronto Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississauga", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mississauga"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississauga"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Sweeteners", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/20800742-1715267171.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555069", "eventUri": "eng-9555069", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The pill never gets easier to swallow; there is so much hype and passion surrounding the team just to see them fail yet again. But this time seems like the final straw; it seems like there could be real change coming this offseason.\n\nWith a new general manager (GM) at the helm, Brad Treliving, he will want to make this team his and get his fingerprints all over it. On top of that, he will also be challenged with what to do in terms of the big five players. There is almost $50 million locked up within five players, and he will need to figure out a way to address that. Ideally, he will look to move on from one of the five main pieces of this team, and if he can get creative, maybe two. The big one is Mitch Marner; he is entering the final year of his contract and will want a large bump in pay to be somewhere near or above William Nylander's $11.5 million per season.\n\nTreliving and the Maple Leafs can go to Marner's camp and tell them they aren't planning on paying him the money he is asking for. They can use this as leverage and convince him to look elsewhere. Unfortunately, he holds the leverage when it comes to the teams that he wants to go to, but if he would agree to it, the Maple Leafs could have a near-perfect trade partner in the Nashville Predators. They could work out a sign-and-trade with the Predators if he would sign off on it, and he would still be on a playoff team and could get the money that he is asking for. Let's explore the idea further.\n\nToronto Maple Leafs Receive: Juuse Saros, Jeremy Lauzon, 2024 2nd Round Pick & 2025 1st Round Pick\n\nNashville Predators Receive: Mitch Marner (eight-year extension) & Calle Jarnkrok\n\nMarner is a Markham-born hockey player who dreamed about one day playing for his boyhood Maple Leafs. He, unlike so many others, got that dream fulfilled when he was drafted by them in 2015. The narrative was already written; a hometown kid will grow up before our very eyes and help lead the Maple Leafs to the Stanley Cup. Well, it's been nine years, and he and his team have only one playoff series win. On top of that, the media pressure has been getting worse, and over the years, he has especially appeared to grow more and more annoyed with it. After this year's loss to the Boston Bruins in the first round.\n\nInsert the Predators; Marner's fit with them is as close to perfect as it gets. They need a star player, preferably a center, but a star. With Marner, they will be getting just that; he can score 95-100 points per season, plays in all situations, and with the potential for less media pressure, may finally be able to perform in the playoffs. With this deal being a sign-and-trade, the Predators would be given time to talk to his agent and work out a deal. Marner could receive anywhere in the ballpark north of $11.5 million for the full eight seasons. Realistically, he will probably want $12 million per season for eight seasons.\n\nRelated: Maple Leafs Could Add Multiple Defensemen if Marner Is Moved\n\nThe Predators will also receive Calle Jarnkrok, who is very familiar with the organization and their GM, Barry Trotz. With him having a modified no-trade clause, he would likely leave his former team off of the list, allowing Treliving to include him in the deal to clear $13 million in salary off of the books. For the Predators, they would be adding around 120-140 points per season in both Marner and Jarnkrok.\n\nWhen a team trades a player of Marner's calibre, you essentially expect to lose the trade. Most teams never win these types of trades, and in the Maple Leafs' case, they know that. Their goal won't be \"winning\" the trade but getting a respectable amount in return and ultimately clearing cap space while helping the organization stay competitive. This deal with the Predators does that for them. They would be acquiring Juuse Saros, who is a true number-one bona fide starter in the NHL, and Jeremy Lauzon, who is a Treliving-style defenceman. Saros is also entering the final year of his contract, and with Yaroslav Arskarov waiting in the wings to take over the crease, the likelihood of him wanting to stay long-term isn't very high. This deal allows him to play in a new city with a new team and, if he is willing, re-sign with his new club.\n\nSaros is what the Maple Leafs desperately need -- a goalie who can steal games and isn't a fringe starter. No disrespect to Ilya Samsonov, but his time with the organization is likely over, regardless of whether this deal is made or not. If Treliving can pull off this deal, it wouldn't necessarily be a \"loss\" because it addresses major needs in the lineup; they would have that goalie that they have been lacking since Freddie Andersen, who can stop shots when they need them most and won't cave under pressure. The Maple Leafs would then be able to offer him an extension and secure the crease alongside Joseph Woll and Dennis Hildeby for the entirety of Auston Matthews' contract. Treliving should offer a new deal somewhere in the neighbourhood of $6.5-$7 million for the next four or five seasons. Currently, he is signed for $5 million and will most likely want a raise, and with the Maple Leafs not having Marner's contract on the books, they will be able to offer Saros $6.5-$7 million.\n\nRelated: Maple Leafs Need to Move on From Either Marner or Rielly\n\nAdditionally, Lauzon is a bone crusher; he threw the most hits in the NHL last season and loves to play on the defensive side of the puck. He is similar to Joel Edmundson, whom Treliving acquired at the 2024 NHL Trade Deadline, for the style of play that he brings to the team. Lauzon is a left-handed shooting defenceman who can play either side and could find a home on a pairing with either Simon Benoit or Edmundson if they offer him an extension. They will also receive two draft picks: a second-round pick in the upcoming 2024 Draft and a 2025 first-round pick. Not only is it crucial to get as much back as you can when you part ways with a high-end player like Marner, but it is also important for the team to recoup draft capital.\n\nAs was already mentioned, the Maple Leafs will be aware that they are probably going to lose this trade if they decide to trade Marner. That might only be on paper, though, as this deal in particular might provide the team with the much-needed cap space to address other areas of need. Ultimately, it could be the leading factor in the Maple Leafs one day winning the Stanley Cup, which wouldn't make this trade a 'loss\". This is the exact reason why Treliving should give the Predators a call and pitch a Marner for Saros deal, as it helps both sides find the potential missing pieces.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_lazary@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Spencer Lazary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Predators", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Predators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juuse_Saros", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juuse Saros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calle_J\u00e4rnkrok", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Calle J\u00e4rnkrok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00e9r\u00e9my_Lauzon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00e9r\u00e9my Lauzon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nylander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Nylander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Treliving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Treliving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Trotz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barry Trotz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hildeby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Hildeby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Woll", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Woll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Matthews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auston Matthews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Samsonov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ilya Samsonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Andersen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frederik Andersen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Edmundson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Edmundson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Juuse-Saros-Predators-3-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555069", "eventUri": "eng-9555069", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

I've got to think that, I like, I wonder how Samsonov feels? He started, he got pulled. They made the right decision, but maybe he's gonna say, 'I want to go somewhere else.'\n\nAnd with Woll, even though he's really talented, they have to be asking yourself, themselves, is he ever going to be healthy? Are we concerned about his health? So they're going to have to consider what they're going to do and goal.\n\nNHL Rumors: What changes need to happen with the Toronto Maple Leafs?\n\nThey're going to have to consider what they're going to do with their core four. You know, (Matthew) Knies obviously took a huge step. They've got a couple of young prospects in (Fraser) Minten and Easton Cowan. They had really good years. Are they going to be ready next year or do they still need some AHL seasoning?\n\nThey've got some cap room. They've got to decide what they want to do on their defense. You know, maybe they weren't great puck movers but those guys played really hard. And like I said, those were three of Toronto's best defensive games they've played with this group. It's going to be interesting.\n\nYou know, are they going to try to extend (Jake) McCabe? I heard in addition to how he played, the organization loves him behind the scenes. Especially when they went down three games to one. A lot of the attitude came from him, the pride with, in the team, the pride in his teammates, the us against the world mentality that would make Pat Quinn proud. Quinn was the king of us against the world and I wouldn't be surprised if they look at him and say, 'What can we do here?'\n\nAre they going to keep Joel Edmundson for another year? They've already extended (Simon) Benoit. Like they have some flexibility and make some room, to make some decisions.\n\nBut I definitely believe there's going to be change and I think the most fascinating one is, you know, what Marner decides and depending on his decision, what do they say to him?\"\n\nMarek: \"Okay, so a couple of things there and just rewinding quickly to the blue line. Safe to say T.J. Brodie, Mark Giordano, who by the way for the longest time in Calgary were fantastic pair together, maybe the best pair in the NHL. I think that's the end of those two players with the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nMarek: \"Listen, Max Domi, we talked about you know one man's injuries another man's opportunities you always like to say. Max Domi fit in their hand to glove and I think really distinguished himself.\n\nI don't know what the situation is on Tyler Bertuzzi. Do the Leafs want him to stay? Does he want to stay? I don't know the answer to any of it.\n\nI do wonder like you do about Joel Edmundson. I thought he had a really good playoffs for the Maple Leafs, albeit brief. Seven games and I think we'll take away from this series that hit on David Pastrnak specifically.\n\nBut you're right, Jake McCabe became the guy on that blue line. and they have him for one more year at a very, very discounted price of $2 million. I do very much wonder what happens there.\n\nNHL Rumors: Friedman's Thoughts on the Future of Toronto Maple Leafs Mitch Marner\n\nBut getting back to Bertuzzi and Domi and these types of players. One of the interesting things through all of this Elliotte and this is not my point. This is a point that's been made in countless other places. But the lion's share of money is occupied between Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, William Nylander, and John Tavares. Yet the issue continues to remain, not defending, but scoring goals here.\n\nThe issue here is you're done with John Tavares is $11 million cap hit after next season. Either John Tavares goes back to the Maple Leafs on a reduced rated or he's just not back with the Maple Leafs at all.\n\nSo if you're making a decision on Mitch Marner, you find yourself in a situation where, and again, I'm the guy this keeps reminding everybody that cap space is the thing. Cap space is a commodity. No one's ...\n\nFriedman: \"We're gonna talk about that in a second.\"\n\nMarek: \"... (working for??) nothing but are you in a situation where, okay, we need to make a decision on one, when really in a year it's going to be a decision on two.\"\n\nFriedman: \"Yeah, I understand your point, Jeff, but I just don't think you can run it back anymore.\"\n\nMarek: \"Oh, I'm not saying run it back. I'm just saying like, does this complicate anything at all?\n\nFriedman: \"No. Whatever decisions you're making now are about your roster, and you can only make the decisions in the order that you contractually can do them, right?\n\nSo you can't worry about Tavares in a year. I mean, you can use it to plan for your cap, but, you know, someone said to me if they really wanted to send a message. I mean really wanted to send a message. What they could do is they could buy out Tavares.\n\nNow from a salary cap point of view. It doesn't make a lot of sense. His salary is almost all bonuses and bonuses are guaranteed. They're not affected by a buyout. So next year, instead of paying, having an $11 million cap hit, it would be like $10.4 (million). And the year after, you know you'd have a $300,000 cap hit. So it really doesn't change your cap picture a lot, but boy, what it sends shockwaves through your roster.\n\nNow the question is, now I would say this, I think there are GMs in the league that would absolutely consider that. I am just not convinced that the Maple Leafs are going to do that. Like Tavares still has very useful moments as a player. So, but it was just interesting that someone presented this to me.\n\nThe thing with Marner is, you know Jeff, it goes to what you said there, I was thinking about this, with Nylander, they were not willing to lose the trade. If they were gonna make that deal last summer, they were not willing to lose the trade. They set a bar. They said if we're trading him, were getting this, a top defender that makes a difference.\n\nIf they really want to change their mix, they have to consider the possibility, especially since Marner can decide where he wants to go, they have to consider the possibility they make the deal and they look like they lose it, and say 'okay, we're going to do this but we're going to do it not for this trade, but to give us the flexibility to do other things.'", "source": {"uri": "s22929.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "s22929.pcdn.co"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_easson@s22929.pcdn.co", "name": "Mark Easson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Marner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Marner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tavares", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Tavares"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Quinn_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pat Quinn (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Domi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Domi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsnet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsnet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Hockey_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Edmundson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Edmundson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pastr\u0148\u00e1k", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Pastr\u0148\u00e1k"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Brodie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Some seasons the main focus has been coaching, others goaltending, and almost always, the core four of Auston Matthews, John Tavares, William Nylander, and Mitch Marner.\n\nRelated: Maple Leafs: 3 Trade Destinations for Mitch Marner\n\nThe main target this year is Marner, who had just two points in their first-round series loss to the Boston Bruins. The 27-year-old struggled to make an impact, registering just a goal and two points in the seven-game series. As a result, there has been plenty of speculation that he could be moved this summer, though he has control over his future thanks to a no-move clause in his contract.\n\nThough it hasn't been as scrutinized, goaltending has also been blamed for this year's exit. Ilya Samsonov wasn't horrible, but didn't play exceptional, either, registering a 3.01 goals against average (GAA) along with a .896 save percentage (SV%). Joseph Woll, who started Games 5 and 6, proved that the Maple Leafs were capable of winning with good goaltending.\n\nThe 25-year-old won both of his outings, kicking aside 54 of the 56 shots he faced. Unfortunately, he was hurt in the dying seconds of Game 6, which meant the Maple Leafs had to turn back to Samsonov for Game 7. Overall, he played well, but wasn't good enough to get the win. Set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer, it is highly unlikely he is back, and calls into question why the Maple Leafs didn't keep a more reliable starter they had on their team four seasons ago in Frederik Andersen.\n\nAndersen was acquired by the Leafs ahead of the 2016-17 season in a trade with the Anaheim Ducks. He wound up being their starter for the next four seasons, before ultimately being supplanted by Jack Campbell during the 2020-21 campaign.\n\nGiven his struggles both in the crease and with health in that 2020-21 season, the Leafs chose to let Andersen walk that offseason, believing that Campbell was the better option. For a brief period of time, that appeared to be the right call, as Campbell came out of the gates hot to start the 2021-22 campaign and was even selected to play in the All-Star Game.\n\nCampbell, however, struggled immensely in the second half of 2021-22, and was part of the reason as to why the Maple Leafs wound up being upset in the first round of the playoffs by the Montreal Canadiens. His collapse in the second half of the season made management very hesitant on bringing him back, and he instead wound up signing a big deal with the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nWith Campbell now out the door, the Maple Leafs decided to try their luck with Matt Murray and Samsonov. To little surprise, Murray was unable to stay healthy, and wasn't very good when he was on the ice. Samsonov, however, impressed, posting a 2.33 GAA and a .919 SV% in 42 appearances.\n\nThanks to the strong play, the Maple Leafs chose to give Samsonov a one-year extension, and had him penned in as their starter this past season. However, as mentioned above, that failed entirely, and will force now general manager (GM) Brad Treliving to find another option to pair with Woll for 2024-25. Looking back now, it's safe to say that former GM Kyle Dubas' decision to let Andersen walk was a major mistake.\n\nWhile Andersen has never been considered an elite goalie, he is in the next-highest tier and has been for quite some time. It isn't as if he took a huge deal when leaving the Maple Leafs, instead signing a very reasonable two-year, $9 million deal with the Carolina Hurricanes. He has since signed another two-year extension with the 'Canes for $6.8 million.\n\nThough he has continued to have some troubles staying healthy and dealt with a blood-clotting issue, Andersen has provided the Hurricanes with great goaltending when he's been able to go. In the 102 games he has played for them, he has a rock-solid 2.22 GAA and a .918 SV%. Those numbers are not only better, but are far more consistent than the Leafs have gotten from anybody since.\n\nWhile Dubas was often looked at as a sage GM during his time in Toronto, it is becoming clearer as time goes on that he made several mistakes. It may not be at the very top of the list, but choosing to let Andersen walk was certainly one of them. It's impossible to say whether or not they would have won a Stanley Cup had they chose to keep him around, but they would certainly have had more reliable goaltending, which wouldn't have hurt for the playoffs.

Other NHL teams will (and already have) come calling", "body": "It's obvious the Core Four concept can't continue. There are already multiple NHL teams that have reached out and shown a keen interest in Marner.\n\nThe team didn't release a picture of me sleeping in a Maple Leafs blanket when I was traded to Toronto in the mid-'90s, but it wouldn't have been that hard to find one if they had asked.\n\nFor Mitch Marner, John Tavares and many others before us, our childhood dreams weren't just about making the NHL or winning a Stanley Cup. We wanted to do it with the Leafs, the Cup-starved team we grew up cheering for.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nTie Domi's first words to me after I arrived in the dressing room were: If we win the Cup here \"they'd break off the city at Yonge and Dundas Streets and it would fall into Lake Ontario.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut something happens to all of us in between the first and last time we put on the blue-and-white jersey. Losing changes everything, and we can all become a little jaded.\n\nAnd really, how can we not? A golden opportunity feels like it's become lost in the blink of an eye. I felt it in 1998, Carlo Colaiacovo probably felt it in 2008, as well as Wayne Simmonds last season. And undoubtedly, Marner and Tavares are feeling closer to it today.\n\nWhile they are both under contract for one more season at around $11 million (U.S.) each, the writing is on the wall. Their chapters as local Leafs players will soon come to an end.\n\nOn Friday, when newly appointed MLSE CEO Keith Pelley, Leafs president Brendan Shanahan and general manager Brad Treliving speak to the media, it's fully expected that they'll be aligned on the team's short-term plans to get this runaway train back on the rails.\n\nUnlike in years past, it will come with a different tone that no longer supports the idea of the Core Four.\n\nMarner is now expendable because of what it will take to re-sign him, while it's time for Tavares to go due to his diminishing role. These factors will be the driving force in why the Leafs will be seeking trades for these two as early as this June's draft.\n\nBoth players have full no-movement clauses that they can exercise until they are free agents after next season, but what's the point of waiting? If the Leafs can find Marner a destination where he's willing to go and his new team has the means to sign him to a long-term contract with an annual salary he can't refuse, then why delay the inevitable?\n\nHere is the good news for Marner: there are already multiple NHL teams that have reached out and shown a keen interest in a three-time all-star player who closes in on 100 points every season. And that's with the knowledge that his next contract could land him as much as $100 million.\n\nWith Friday's press conference set to push the narrative that the team is still very much in a position to win now, this is the fastest, most legitimate chance the Leafs have to bring back the salary-cap balance needed to reinforce their defence and goaltending.\n\nBut for this to really work, it's imperative that every decision is cunning and calculated with no margin for error. They can't miss like Kyle Dubas did with the Nazem Kadri trade in 2019, or Treliving did with the Matthew Tkachuk trade as GM of the Flames in 2022.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTrading an elite, skilled forward still very much in his prime has to restock the barren cupboards.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the Leafs will easily jump into the deep end of the free-agent pool this summer, where their eyes are already focused on defencemen Chris Tanev, Brandon Montour and Brett Pesce. Landing not one but two of these unrestricted free agents is imperative.\n\nAs far as Tavares goes, it's not an easy job to tell your captain and a veteran of 1,109 NHL games that the contract he was given no longer works here and arrangements to move elsewhere will need to be made.\n\nFinding a taker for Tavares' services wouldn't come with the same anxiety of off-loading Patrick Marleau's $6.25-million contract to the Hurricanes in 2019. That conditional first-round pick handed to Carolina ended up being Seth Jarvis, who had 33 goals and 67 points this season.\n\nThe Leafs could pay Tavares his $7-million signing bonus owed on July 1, and many aspiring playoff teams would gladly take the NHL veteran for one year at that sizable discount.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThere will likely be a reluctance for Tavares to waive his no-move clause in his hometown, but that feeling is usually followed with a reluctance to stay in a place that you are no longer wanted.\n\nWhen he was signed to a seven-year deal in 2018, Tavares was asked what it would mean to help bring a Stanley Cup to Toronto for the first time since 1967.\n\n\"I mean, it's hard to put that into words, right? People have been waiting for that for a long time, people are hungry for it,\" he said at the time, offering no guarantees.\n\nTavares and Marner had hoped to be the hometown heroes but have just one playoff series victory in six seasons on a team that never had the right balance from Day 1. Now it's time to wake up from that childhood dream.\n\nKyper's KornerAt the time of writing Wednesday afternoon, things were was heating up for Craig Berube's coaching services. When the Senators declared they weren't interested in paying their next coach much more than $1.2 million to $1.5 million, Berube quickly scratched his name off that list.Most are suggesting any team that signs Berube will need a financial commitment that starts at $5 million annually for five years, which leaves him with ... New Jersey? Toronto? Los Angeles?The Kings seem happy with the work interim head coach Jim Hiller did, but as of mid-week hadn't made a full commitment. There is a strong suggestion they are kicking the tires on Berube.Winnipeg will look around the league to replace retiring coach Rick Bowness, but it's a good bet they'll settle on current associate Scott Arniel.Change(d) my mind\n\nOn the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs: I always felt it was the best hockey of the year, every year. Not so much this time, though.

With the team firing coach Sheldon Keefe on Thursday, Mitch Marner's future with the club is perhaps the biggest.\n\nMarner has a year remaining on his contract with a cap hit of $10.9 million. The 27-year-old right winger will become a UFA next July unless he and the Leafs agree to a contract extension. He's stated his willingness to remain a Leaf while his teammates supported him against criticism of his play during their first-round series against the Boston Bruins.\n\nHowever, Marner's underwhelming performance against the Bruins still has some observers believing he'll become a trade candidate this summer.\n\nThe Hockey News' Michael DeRosa cited the Toronto Star's Kevin McGran suggesting Marner might be better off in one of the Sunshine states where he can be the best player while enjoying anonymity. He proposed offering the winger up to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for defenseman Mikhail Sergachev. He also mentioned the Utah franchise as another destination.\n\nDon't hold your breath on that Lightning swap. Their efforts to re-sign captain Steven Stamkos are complicated by their limited cap space. They won't deplete their defense corps by trading away Sergachev, who's signed through 2030-31 and has a no-trade clause kicking in on July 1.\n\nUtah can easily afford Marner's salary and possesses plenty of trade capital in draft picks and prospects to tempt the Leafs. However, they might not be on his list of preferred trade destinations.\n\nIf Marner is willing to waive his no-movement clause, the Toronto Sun's Terry Koshan suggested testing the trade market to see if he'll fetch a No. 1 defenseman. Failing that, they can use the money they would've invested in re-signing him by pursuing a top blueliner via next summer's trade or free-agent markets.\n\nKoshan's colleague Steve Simmons doubted Marner and Leafs captain John Tavares would agree to waive their NMCs. He also thinks Marner's trade value will be limited compared to his worth because he only has a year left on his contract.\n\nThat hasn't stopped some observers from proposing trade destinations and scenarios.\n\nTHN's Adam Proteau suggested the Pittsburgh Penguins, Chicago Blackhawks, New York Islanders, Anaheim Ducks and Utah as new homes for Marner.\n\nSportsnet's Ryan Dixon pitched the Columbus Blue Jackets for Kent Johnson and a first-rounder, the Seattle Kraken for Shane Wright and Adam Larsson, the Philadelphia Flyers in a three-team trade involving the San Jose Sharks, and a multi-player blockbuster with the Calgary Flames bringing goalie Jacob Markstrom and defenseman Rasmus Andersson to Toronto.\n\nPhilly Hockey Now's Jonathan Bailey believes the Flyers should steer clear of Marner given his reputation as an inconsistent playoff performer. It remains to be seen if pundits in those other cities feel the same.\n\nRelated: Five NHL Teams Toronto's Mitch Marner Should Consider Joining If He Waives No-Move Clause\n\nRelated: Trade Marner?

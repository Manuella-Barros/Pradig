{"id": 231364550, "title": "Modi To Take Oath as PM for 3rd Term Today", "text": "NEW DELHI: Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi is set to take the oath of office on Sunday for a third consecutive term, matching the record of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. This milestone comes amid intense discussions within the BJP leadership and its allies over the allocation of Cabinet positions in the new National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. Senior BJP leaders Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, along with party president J.P. Nadda, have been in talks with allies such as Telugu Desam's N. Chandrababu Naidu, JD(U)'s Nitish Kumar, and Shiv Sena's Eknath Shinde to finalise their representation in the Union Cabinet.Ahead of Sunday's ceremony, Nadda met with Shah, and BJP's national general secretary (organisation) B.L. Santosh was also present. Sources indicate that Modi has consulted with senior BJP leaders, including Nadda and Shah, about the formation of the new government.Sources suggest that key portfolios like home, finance, defense, and external affairs, as well as ideologically significant ministries such as education and culture, will remain with the BJP. Allies are expected to receive between five to eight cabinet berths. There is also speculation that Suresh Gopi, the first BJP Lok Sabha member from Kerala, may be appointed as a minister of state.Senior BJP leaders Shah and Singh are expected to retain their cabinet positions. Additionally, former chief ministers who won Lok Sabha seats, such as Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Basavaraj Bommai, Manohar Lal Khattar, and Sarbananda Sonowal, are strong contenders for cabinet roles.Allies likely to join the new government include TD's Ram Mohan Naidu, JD(U)'s Lalan Singh, Sanjay Jha, and Ram Nath Thakur, and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas)'s Chirag Paswan, according to sources.Maharashtra and Bihar, states where the BJP and its allies faced electoral challenges, are expected to be focal points in the Cabinet formation. Maharashtra will hold Assembly polls in October, and Bihar's elections are slated for next year.Impending changes within the BJP's organisation will also influence the selection of ministers. Nadda's term was extended due to the Lok Sabha polls, and the party's leadership will consider organisational needs highlighted by recent poll results. This opens the possibility of experienced leaders being appointed to party roles, with Nadda potentially joining the government, sources indicated.", "summary": "Matches record set by first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/modi-to-take-oath-as-pm-for-3rd-term-today-898030", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/08/1095788-aa-2308259.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:27:25", "author": "Shashi Bhushan", "authors": ["Shashi Bhushan"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.01}

It was the home for our church for a long time.\" First Baptist Dallas moved to a new worship center about 12 years ago.\n\n\"This historic sanctuary was the site of many personal events, including my own,\" Jeffress recalled. \"I was baptized there when I was six, I was ordained for the ministry when I was 21, it holds a lot of memories, but we thank God that nobody has been hurt. We had just concluded vacation bible school with over 2,000 kids. They were all gone, so God has protected us through all of this.\"\n\n\"I am grateful that the church is not bricks and mortar or wood, it's people, and the people of God will endure,\" he added.\n\nFirst Baptist Dallas has 16,000 members, according to its website. The church is part of the Southern Baptist Convention, the second-largest Christian denomination behind Catholicism.\n\nThe pastor said that \"nothing has been ruled in or out at this point.\"\n\nAccording to the Dallas Fire-Rescue website, 64 fire teams were working to combat the fire as of 9 p.m. Central.\n\nPurported footage of the church on fire went viral on social media.\n\nThe fire comes one day after the Republican National Convention ended in Milwaukee. At the convention, Republicans nominated Trump, who had barely survived an assassination attempt on Saturday.\n\nJeffress has long praised and prayed for Trump, publicly appearing with him at events as far back as September 2015.\n\nThis is a breaking story and will be updated.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jeffress", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Jeffress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sanctuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Baptist_Church_(Dallas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Baptist Church (Dallas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_San_Jacinto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battle of San Jacinto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chapel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bible college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baptism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritualism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritualism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Universal_Life_Church", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Universal Life Church", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748611", "eventUri": "eng-9748611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-09-", "textStart": 2780, "textEnd": 2794}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

(SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe historic sanctuary of First Baptist Church of Dallas, the church led by Pastor Robert Jeffress, caught fire on Friday night. The cause remains unknown, though the fire comes less than one week after an attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, of whom Jeffress has long been an impassioned supporter.\n\n\"Dallas Fire-Rescue is currently battling a two-alarm fire in a building located at 1717 San Jacinto Street,\" Chief Robert Borse told The Daily Signal. \"The initial call was received at 6:05 p.m., and crews arrived on scene at 6:09 p.m.\"\n\n\"First arriving crews were confronted with heavy smoke and fire conditions involving the structure and immediately initiated fire attack operations,\" he added.\n\nThe department confirmed that the secondary chapel of the First Baptist Church is the structure involved.\n\n\"Fire operations are defensive and a partial collapse of the structure occurred just after 7:30 p.m.,\" Borse added. \"At this time, no injuries have been reported.\"\n\n\"A little bit after 6 p.m. we got word that the church was on fire, our historic sanctuary,\" Jeffress told an ABC News local affiliate. \"This sanctuary has been around since 1890. It was the home for our church for a long time.\" First Baptist Dallas moved to a new worship center about 12 years ago.\n\n\"This historic sanctuary was the site of many personal events, including my own,\" Jeffress recalled. \"I was baptized there when I was six, I was ordained for the ministry when I was 21, it holds a lot of memories, but we thank God that nobody has been hurt. We had just concluded vacation bible school with over 2,000 kids.

They continue working but the primary fire has been extinguished. One way or another, we intend to meet for church this Sunday. More details to follow. We hope to see you there.\"\n\nFire and rescue crews responded to a call about a fire on San Jacinto Street at 6:05 p.m., and a second alarm was requested around 6:20 p.m., according to NBC DFW. Fire crews were still present at the scene Saturday morning.\n\nIt is unclear what caused the fire, and it is under investigation. According to Dallas Fire-Rescue, the church's secondary chapel was impacted by the fire and suffered a partial collapse.\n\nThe red brick building, known as the church's old sanctuary, was built in 1890. It was the church's home for a long time before it moved to its new worship center about 12 years ago. First Baptist Dallas has been led by Pastor Robert Jeffress, a Fox News contributor and host of the daily radio program radio \"Pathway to Victory,\" which is aired on hundreds of stations nationwide. On social media, Jeffress urged prayer for the church.\n\n\"We have experienced a fire in the Historic Sanctuary. To our knowledge, no one is hurt or injured, and we thank God for His protection. He is sovereign even in the most difficult times,\" he wrote. \"'And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.' - Romans 8:28.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox 4, Jeffress said that the sanctuary was the site of many personal events, including his baptism when he was 6 and when he was ordained for the ministry at 21. The church had just concluded vacation Bible school with over 2,000 kids at the sanctuary.\n\n\"It holds a lot of memories,\" Jeffress said. \"We thank God nobody was hurt. ... I'm grateful that the church is not brick and mortar, its people. The people of God will endure. First Baptist Dallas will endure. We thank so many of our friends around the country who are praying for us right now.\"\n\nThe fire drew responses from many prominent Christian leaders and politicians.\n\n\"While our hearts are broken that we will never sit on these pews or stand in that pulpit of the historic sanctuary again at FBC Dallas we give thanks to God for the multiplied scores of thousands since 1891 who walked these aisles to give their hearts to the Lord Jesus,\" O.S. Hawkins, chancellor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth and president emeritus at GuideStone, wrote on X.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, posted a tweet saying he and his family are praying for First Baptist Dallas.\n\n\"First Baptist is a historic church -- the late Rev. Billy Graham was a member here for over half a century,\" Cruz wrote. \"I am confident God's Light will shine down on the First Baptist.\"\n\nWhile the late evangelist Graham didn't reside in Dallas, he was a member of the church from 1953 until 2008, when he moved his membership closer to his home in North Carolina, the Dallas Morning News reported at the time.\n\nDenny Burk, the director of the Center for Gospel and Culture at Boyce College of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kentucky, wrote on X that he and his wife were members of the church before moving to Louisville. He called the fire a \"grievous loss.\"\n\n\"It was where we worshipped weekly when we were members. It had no sprinkler system and (I suspect) has long been a tinderbox,\" he wrote. \"The church had back-to-back historic pastorates in the twentieth century. Two pastors who each ministered for 50 years. Two pastors in a hundred years! George W. Truett followed by W.A. Criswell. Both of them preached in that building. Both of them towering figures in the SBC.\"", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jeffress", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Jeffress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sanctuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_San_Jacinto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battle of San Jacinto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KXAS-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KXAS-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bible college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Baptist Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism_of_Jesus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baptism of Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Rome"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._A._Criswell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "W.

Robert Jeffress, said that he understood from his conversations with fire officials that in the fire's final phase, the roof of what is known as the historic sanctuary had collapsed.\n\n\"We will have to see about whether we try to recreate it or do something else,\" he said in an interview.\n\nDallas Fire-Rescue did not immediately provide information about the fire, but a spokesman told The Dallas Morning news that part of the structure had collapsed.\n\nGavin Nicholson, who lives in a high-rise apartment complex that overlooks the church complex, confirmed that it looked like a roof collapse; he could see flames coming from the center of the building.\n\n\"A piece of Dallas history is gone,\" said Mr. Nicholson, who is the chief of staff for Venton Jones, a state representative whose district includes a portion of the city.\n\nNo one was hurt in the blaze, which started shortly after the church had held a Bible school event that included 2,000 children, Mr. Jeffress said. That had been held in another section of the church.\n\n\"Fortunately they were all gone when the fire erupted,\" he said in an interview, adding that its cause was not known.\n\nVideos posted to social media showed the building engulfed in orange flames and black smoke billowing to the sky. Witnesses reported hearing a loud blast.\n\nThe First Baptist Dallas church is a sprawling complex made up of several connected buildings. The historic sanctuary, built in 1890, was where the church held smaller, contemporary services. With its stained glass and prominent pipe organ, it has also been a popular wedding venue.\n\nMr. Jeffress said there was no significant damage to other parts of the complex.\n\nFirefighters responded to the blaze at the sanctuary just after 6 p.m. local time. Over the next two hours, more than 60 firefighting units responded, according to Dallas Fire-Rescue's website. Mr. Jeffress said around 11 p.m. that the fire had been contained.\n\nIn a post on social media, a former pastor of the church, O. S. Hawkins, called it a \"tragically sad day\" for the congregation.\n\nThe church, which has 16,000 members, was established in 1868, just a few decades after Dallas itself.\n\nUnlike many newer megachurches typically found in the suburbs or exurbs of major cities, First Baptist Dallas is squarely downtown, near office buildings, museums and hotels. Along with its regular membership, it attracts a steady stream of tourists and visitors drawn by high-profile events like its annual \"Freedom Sunday\" celebration around the Fourth of July.\n\nIn a statement posted on social media, the church said it was thankful for the emergency workers who went to the scene and that it plans to meet on Sunday. Mr. Jeffress said the location was still to be determined.\n\n\"The church is not about wood and brick and mortar,\" he said. \"It's people.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jeffress", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Jeffress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sanctuary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-rise_building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High-rise building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bible college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exurb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exurb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_organ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipe organ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megachurch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Megachurch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_and_mortar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brick and mortar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stained_glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stained glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritualism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritualism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Universal_Life_Church", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Universal Life Church", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Fire-Badly-Damages-Sanctuary-of-a-Landmark-Church-in-Dallas.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748611", "eventUri": "eng-9748611", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The First Baptist Church, which was constructed in 1868 with its sanctuary added in 1890, holds significant historical value in the area. Pastor Robert Jeffress of the church has requested prayers for the building and the congregation during this difficult time.\n\nIn a statement, Pastor Jeffress reassured the community that no injuries were reported due to the fire and expressed gratitude for the protection provided by God. He shared a message of faith and hope, quoting Romans 8:28 to emphasize the belief that all things will work together for good for those who trust in God's plan.\n\nAs the situation continues to unfold, the church plans to keep its members informed about the next steps and arrangements for worship services. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of coming together in times of crisis and relying on faith for strength and guidance.\n\nThe historic First Baptist Dallas Church holds a special place in the hearts of many residents, and the impact of this fire is deeply felt throughout the community. Efforts to assess the damage and restore the church to its former glory are expected to begin soon, with the support and prayers of those who cherish its presence in downtown Dallas.\n\nAs more information becomes available, updates on the situation will be provided to offer clarity and assurance to concerned individuals. The unity and resilience of the congregation and the local authorities working to address the aftermath of the fire are testament to the strength of the community in facing challenges together.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple-alarm_fire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multiple-alarm fire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Baptist_Church_(Dallas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Baptist Church (Dallas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_San_Jacinto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battle of San Jacinto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jeffress", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Jeffress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Dallas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baptists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Rome"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritualism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritualism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Universal_Life_Church", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Universal Life Church", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/news-19072024-203645.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748611", "eventUri": "eng-9748611", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

First responders were called to the church's secondary chapel on San Jacinto Street and were confronted with \"heavy smoke and fire conditions involving the structure,\" said fire Capt. Robert Borse.\n\nHere's what to know about First Baptist Dallas and its long history.\n\nAdvertisementWhat were First Baptist Dallas church's origins?\n\nThe church was established in 1868 as a small congregation of three men and eight women, and has expanded to serve Southern Baptist Dallas residents for over 150 years since then, according to a story in The Dallas Morning News on the church's 150th anniversary.\n\nAdvertisementPHOTOS: First Baptist Dallas church fire 9 imagesView GalleryBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIn the church's early years, congregation members convened in the Masonic Hall on Lamar Street.\n\nThe church's 11 founding members pooled their funds in 1872 to buy the first building, which was located on Akard Street in downtown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst Baptist is a nonprofit organization with over 15,000 members. The church provides its members with opportunities beyond traditional Sunday ministry, including international mission trips, music-based worship, volunteer opportunities and more.\n\nWhen and how did First Baptist Dallas church expand?\n\nIn 2013, the church renovated and expanded its campus to add a 3,000 seat worship center, building out close to the historic building.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCosting $130 million, the church's expansion became the most expensive Protestant building project in modern history. The center is greater than 178,000 square feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the church's 150th anniversary ceremony in July 2018, Gov. Greg Abbott called the church \"an example to all Texans of God's faithfulness.\"\n\nThe church's facilities cost over $135 million today, and prior to the fire, Senior Pastor Robert Jeffress had begun fundraising for an expansion that he hoped would add two more levels to the church's three-floor family center.\n\nWho is Senior Pastor Robert Jeffress?\n\nJeffress has been the church's senior pastor for almost 17 years. Previously, he served as the senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Wichita Falls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeffress has become a well-known national figure. He's a regular contributor to Fox News who has drawn criticism for some of his politically charged remarks, focused on three aspects of sustaining First Baptist's success: commitment to the church, spreading the Gospel and grounding itself in the Bible.\n\nHe became one of former President Donald Trump's most prominent Christian advisers and was a frequent visitor to the White House during his presidency.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreFire at First Baptist Dallas causes historic secondary chapel to partially collapseWhat we know: Fire breaks out at First Baptist Church of DallasFarmers Branch

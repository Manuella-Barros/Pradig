The Senate also approved the registration of courses for some students who paid school fees and participated in examinations in the 2022/2023 session but did not do so then. The AAU, Ekpoma, Senate called for the emergency meeting following a peaceful protest at the University gate by some students requesting that they be allowed to register their courses which they failed to do in the 2022/2023 session, and some law students over a \u2018Proceeding\u2019 list released by the Faculty of Law. According to a memo issued and signed by the University\u2019s Acting Registrar, Comrade Ambrose E. Odiase, after the meeting, \u201ctheSenate considered its extant rule that provides that only students with a CGPA of 3.0 and above in the Faculty of Law should proceed to the next level. \u201cThis rule is to ensure that the University maintains its leading role of providing excellent and quality legal education for its students and to comply with the admission quota prescribed by the Council of Legal Education. \u201cBased on the response of students to the implementation of this rule and the appeals therefrom, Senate magnanimously approved that a CGPA of 2.5 be used to determine those to proceed to 300 level in the Faculty for the 2022/2023 session only. \u201cSenate also considered the extension of normal course registration for the 2023/2024 session, and graciously approved that normal course registration in the University be extended for another two (2) weeks period, I.e from Thursday 6th June, 2024 to Thursday, 20th June 2024. \u201cSenate hoped that students would seize the opportunity of this magnanimous extension to complete their course registration within the new window.\u201d On the issue of non-registration of courses by some students who paid school fees and participated in examinations in the 2022/2023 session, Senate approved that one week be given to them to carry out the course registration formalities, through the ICT back end. Senate further approved that all other students experiencing difficulties in course registration should write to the Chairman of Senate through their respective departmental board of studies and Faculty Boards. These would be considered based on their individual merits and these requests must be made within the next two (2) weeks from Thursday 6th June 2024, to Thursday, 20th June, 2024. Meanwhile, the Management of Ambrose Alli University has described as completely false reports making the rounds in some media that the students were protesting alleged Management\u2019s \u201charsh policies.\u201d The University, through its Head of Corporate Communication and Protocol, Otunba Mike Aladenika, in an interview said: \u201cIssues conversed in the media are a far cry, over bloated and distant from the reality on ground and what the students were asking for. According to him, \u201cYou can see from the resolutions of the Senate of the University that the University means well for its students. The protest was led by students who failed, through faults of theirs, to follow through with existing extant rules of the University which they are conversant with, and those who had issues with the \u2018Proceeding List\u201d. On the course registration issue, Aladenika said, \u201cwhile thousands of their mates in the University obeyed the deadlines, which were extended several times, and are not having issues, these ones didn\u2019t. \u201cThe University Management met with their leaders several times prior to this protest, but they remained adamant and kept insisting that the University must turn the hand of the clock backwards and open the portal for them to register for a session that had already passed, with all its technical consequences.\u201d Aladenika also lamented that from the reports in the conventional and social media on the protest that he had read so far, it had become clear that several interests had come into this matter and some people were adding fuel to fire for their political benefits. \u201cI singled out some reports that were coming even while the Senate was still meeting, inflaming passions, reporting non-existent \u201ccrisis\u201d in the University, and the video where an unidentified person was talking about the University being purportedly closed by Governor Obaseki to favour a University allegedly owned by an alleged brother of the PDP governorship aspirant, Barrister Asue Ighodalo. \u201cThis is madness taken too far! How could a protest by students translate to a governor, who was not even aware of the protest, closing down the University for the interest of a gubernatorial aspirant?\u201d Aladenika however noted that for several months now, Ambrose Alli University has been enjoying peace. \u201cAcademic activities have been going on smoothly here. Salaries are being paid regularly, the last one being the May salaries which were paid to the University workers as early as May 24th. Our inaugural and other lectures have been going on smoothly. \u201cFor more than a year, in fact, since May, 2022, we have had an uninterrupted academic calendar. We advise politicians to steer clear of our University and not use it as cannon fodder for their shenanigans and campaigns. This University is a peaceful place. Politicians should leave us alone.\u201d Otunba Aladenika therefore enjoined members of the University community and the general public to disregard the said reports in their entirety.AAU Protest: Our Decisions Are In Best Interest Of Students \u2013 Says ManagementBy Francis Onoiribholo Bureau Chief Benin The Senate of Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, has taken action to douse the tension created by the protest carried out by the students on Wednesday, approving the extension of normal course registration on the portal for the 2023/2024 academic session by two weeks.

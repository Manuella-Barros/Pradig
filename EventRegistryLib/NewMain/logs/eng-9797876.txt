Several Bollywood celebs came out in support of Vinesh Phogat, while some even expressed disappointment and pulled up their nutritionist.\n\nVeteran actor turned politician Hema Malini also shared her two cents after Vinesh was disqualified for being slightly overweight\n\nHema Malini said its 'a lesson for all of us' to keep our weight in check.\n\nTalking to PTI, Hema Malini said, \"It is very surprising and bada ajeeb sa bhi lagta hain ki 100 gm ki wajah se woh disqualify ho gayi.

As soon as the gold came, the internet started attacking PM Modi, asking how he would talk to her after ignoring her for months after she made molestation allegations against former Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.\n\nHowever, in a very quick turn of events, Phogat's medal was canceled today, and it was claimed that she was 100 gms overweight. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who never congratulated her on winning, immediately posted a tweet after she lost the medal.\n\nThe internet was already irked by this move and now BJP leader Hema Malini has also reacted to the situation while talking to the media and in her statement she asked Vinesh Phogat and other women to take this as a lesson.\n\nThe actress said, \"It is very surprising, Bada ajeeb sa lagta hai. 100 gm ki wajah se wo disqualify ho gayi to kitna mahattava hai apne wazan ko theek se rakhna, humlog ko isse accha seekh milna chahiye.

However, she was not allowed to meet PM Modi. After she won the gold, the entire internet waited for the call of the year when PM would finally speak to her. But neither did he call or tweeted celebrating the win.\n\nIn fact, after Vinesh Phogat was disqualified, PM tweeted, \"Vinesh, you are a champion among champions! You are India's pride and an inspiration for each and every Indian. Today's setback hurts. I wish words could express the sense of despair that I am experiencing. At the same time, I know that you epitomize resilience. It has always been your nature to take challenges head-on. Come back stronger!

She always talks like she is going to end that sentence and then ask you if you have any snacks, especially sweet ones,\" added another.\n\n\"You don't have .0001gm of intelligence or decency in you. So, please keep quiet,\" wrote one user.\n\nAnother user commented, \"My god. Is Hema Malini ok? This is shameful.\"\n\nThe Indian Olympic contingent's statement read, \"It is with regret that the Indian contingent shares news of the disqualification of Vinesh Phogat from the Women's Wrestling 50 kg class. Despite the best efforts by the team through the night, she weighed in a few grams over 50 kg this morning. No further comments will be made by the contingent at this time. The Indian team requests you respect Vinesh's privacy. It would like to focus on the competitions on hand.\"\n\nVinesh Phogat had entered the Gold Medal bout after beating Cuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lopez 5-0 in the semi-finals on Tuesday night.\n\nDuring Lok Sabha Elections 2024, Hema Malini exhibited her political prowess by winning the Mathura constituency for the third consecutive time. Her victory, with a staggering margin of 2,93,407 votes, is a testament to her enduring popularity and the affection of her constituents.\n\nAfter her win, she said, \"I am very happy that I am getting a chance to serve people for the third time, I thank the people... I am getting an opportunity to complete all the work that was left incomplete...

This unfortunate event occurred on the morning of her final bout, despite her being within the required weight limit on the first day of her bouts. The disqualification came as a shock to the nation, but actor Hema Malini's reaction to the news has now irked netizens.\n\nReacting to this news, the politician stated that it was \"a lesson for all of us\" to keep our weight in check. She expressed her surprise and disappointment at Phogat's disqualification due to being 100gm overweight. \"It is important to keep the weight in check. It is a lesson for all of us. I wish she should lose that 100gm quickly but she would not get an opportunity,\" said Malini in a statement to PTI.\n\nHer comment sparked outrage on the internet, with many finding it insensitive and inappropriate in this context. Many comments criticized her understanding of sports and wrestling, calling her unfit for Parliament. One comment read, \"Being overweight by 100g is more of a logistical error and bad luck rather than her being unhealthy...Do you realize that the extreme training and the strict diet these Olympic athletes follow...Saying these things makes it seem that she was eating samosas and ice cream everyday.\"\n\nSeveral Bollywood stars including Alia Bhatt, Vicky Kaushal, Farhan Akhtar, Taapsee Pannu, Sonakshi Sinha, and Varun Grover expressed their support for Phogat on social media following her disqualification. Pannu wrote, \"This is heartbreaking but honestly, this woman has already made her mark beyond gold by now!\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi also expressed his support for Phogat, tweeting, \"Vinesh, you are a champion among champions! You are India's pride and an inspiration for each and every Indian. Today's setback hurts.\"\n\nDespite the best efforts by the team to reduce her weight overnight, Phogat weighed in a few grams over 50kg on the morning of her final bout.

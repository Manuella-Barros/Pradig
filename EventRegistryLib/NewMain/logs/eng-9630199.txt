He said it would be the basis for the final draft that will come out in Congress.\n\nMarcos said the government is resorting to the old system, saying that the 15% upfront payment before land turnover is reasonable.\n\nMeanwhile, Rogelio Singson, a member of the PSAC-ISG, told Marcos there's no issue regarding cost as the government is offering market price. He said the problem comes from the actual process.\n\n\"As you said, you just need the deposit and then go to the expropriation, let the courts decide how much will be the eventual cost, but the writ of possession has to be issued,\" Singson said.\n\n\"Because Mr. President, once the writ of possession is issued by the court, then the project can already proceed,'' he added.\n\nEarlier, Marcos directed the creation of an Inter-Agency Committee for Right-of Way (ROW) Activities for National Railway Projects, which aims to streamline the process of land acquisition for all the railway projects across the country.\n\nTo recall, it was in February 2023 when the House of Representatives approved on third and final reading a bill expediting right-of-way (ROW) acquisition and implementation on infrastructure projects. -- RSJ, GMA Integrated News", "source": {"uri": "gmanetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GMA Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_felicia_bajo@gmanetwork.com", "name": "Anna Felicia Bajo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongbong_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bongbong Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-of-way_(transportation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right-of-way (transportation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Communications_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential Communications Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaca\u00f1ang_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaca\u00f1ang Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Writ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogelio_Singson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rogelio Singson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senate of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMA_Integrated_News_and_Public_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GMA Integrated News and Public Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President (government title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Project_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Project Management", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Workflow", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Workflow", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Engineering", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business_Process_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Business Process Analysis", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://images.gmanews.tv/webpics/2024/06/marcos3_2024_06_06_11_50_13.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630199", "eventUri": "eng-9630199", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

I spoke to Chiz and to Martin -- the Speaker and the SP (Senate President) and I said there is a bill. There's a house bill that's going through the process that wants to amend the right-of-way process,\" he added.\n\nPSAC-ISG member Rogelio Singson, a former chief of the Department of Public Works and Highways, said proposed amendments to prevailing right-of-way procedures pose no problems when it comes to cost as long as the government offers the market price for the property.\n\n\"As you said, you just need the deposit and then go to the expropriation, let the courts decide how much will be the eventual cost, but the writ of possession has to be issued,\" Singson noted.", "source": {"uri": "newsinfo.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jean_mangaluz@newsinfo.inquirer.net", "name": "Jean Mangaluz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-of-way_(transportation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right-of-way (transportation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Communications_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential Communications Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Escudero", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis Escudero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_for_England_and_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General for England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the Senate of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Romualdez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Romualdez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talagang", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talagang"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Talagang"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_Cause_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workers' Cause Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Public_Works_and_Highways", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Department of Public Works and Highways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogelio_Singson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rogelio Singson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Writ"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Cost Management", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 8}], "image": "https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2024/05/722968-e1716766215148.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630199", "eventUri": "eng-9630199", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 387, "textEnd": 393}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

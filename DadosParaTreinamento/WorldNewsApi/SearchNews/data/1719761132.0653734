One of his victims was a woman who had her back turned to him outside the former downtown library branch, while Bolton\u2019s other target was a 73-year-old man with a walker at a bus stop. \u201cThe aggravating factors in this case include \u2026 the vulnerability of the victims,\u201d Ontario Court Justice Scott Pratt said in his written judgment. \u201cThe offender did not choose to attack two members of the Detroit Lions. Both were easy prey.\u201d Armed with a knife in both cases, Bolton attacked the woman last Oct. 2 by grabbing her by the hair from behind and then stabbing her through the cheek. The victim was put in a chokehold and thrown to the ground as the robber \u2014 his face concealed with a shirt \u2014 demanded money. A folding knife was found on the ground, and a witness at the scene and surveillance video helped Windsor police track down and arrest the perpetrator. Bolton recently pleaded guilty to that offence as well as an earlier attack on a senior on May 18, 2023. He had approached the man, 73 years old at the time, at a bus stop and asked whether he could call him a taxi.", "summary": "If a poster child were ever needed to sell Windsor taxpayers on city council&#8217;s multimillion-dollar plan to spruce up the downtown \u2014 with a beefed-up police presence being key \u2014 it would be Timothy Bolton.

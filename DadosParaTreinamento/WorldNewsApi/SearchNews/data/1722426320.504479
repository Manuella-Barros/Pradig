Although a lot of fans have claimed not to enjoy the matches, they have at least enjoyed some shock results, quick VAR resolutions, stunning goals and a slew of own goals. Spain has been pretty good. La Roja are the only team that qualified with nine maximum points. Austria has owned the dark horses' label with pomp and bravery. However, teams like England and France have been unconvincing so far, with Les Bleus barely making it through. \"It\u2019s been a highly competitive edition compared to previous years and it seems like the underdogs are as hungry for success just like the usual favourites are,\" Ope Adebari, a sports analyst, reporter and producer with News Central tells DAILY POST. \"It\u2019s good to see teams like Georgia, Denmark, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania advance to the next stage at the expense of teams like Croatia and Ukraine. \"However, we\u2019re yet to see the tournament favourites, France and England kick into full gear. The major surprises for me have been Spain and Germany. \"Both teams seem to be more thirsty and hungry compared to other tournament favourites.\" Nwosu Michael Izuchukwu, a podcaster and digital marketer, adds: \"The best games have been played by teams you wouldn\u2019t exactly look forward to watching. \"At least until qualification for the round of 16 came down to the final match day of the group stage. \"Croatia vs Italy game really produced a wowzer. But generally, it\u2019s been very underwhelming (at least for me). \"Shoutout to Austria though. They really rocked my world, qualifying ahead of both France and Netherlands in Group D. \"And then there\u2019s the madness that happened in Group E, where everyone finished with four points.\" Every fan and pundit seem to agree on the standout last-16 fixture. \"It has to be the Belgium and France encounter. I think the game will bring out the best in both teams and their star players,\" Adebari said. Before the tournament kicked off, Belgium and France were regarded as favourites to win the trophy. But one of the two countries will be eliminated before the quarter-finals. So what teams can we expect to be left standing? \"With how some of these 'favorites' have been playing in this tournament, it\u2019ll be hard to call. \"But I\u2019ll say: Spain, Germany, Portugal, France, Netherlands, Austria, England and Switzerland,\" Izuchukwu said.", "summary": "<img width=\"978\" height=\"549\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-29-6.18.51-AM.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-29-6.18.51-AM.jpg 978w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-29-6.18.51-AM-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px\" /><p>Euro 2024 featured 24 teams for the first time, in what was a newly-expanded format for the tournament.

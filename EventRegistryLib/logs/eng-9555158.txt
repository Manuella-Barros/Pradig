Whitehouse told Yahoo Finance last month that other central banks around the world closely consider climate change because \"if left unchecked climate change will pose 'systemic risks' to our financial system and the broader economy.\"\n\nAnd Republicans have also repeatedly come down on Powell for considering rules that would test banks' ability to withstand climate-related scenarios, arguing it falls out of the scope of the Fed's authority.\n\nNot everyone within the Fed agrees with the approach, either.\n\nLast May, Fed Governor Chris Waller said he doesn't believe climate change poses a serious risk to the US financial system even as the central bank tested the resilience of banks under different climate scenarios.\n\n\"Climate change is real, but I do not believe it poses a serious risk to the safety and soundness of large banks or the financial stability of the United States,\" Waller said in a speech in Madrid, Spain.\n\n\"I don't see a need for special treatment for climate-related risks in our financial stability monitoring and policies,\" he added.\n\nBut Powell maintains that the central bank has a narrow role that relates to supervising banks.\n\n\"The public will expect that the institutions we regulate and supervise will understand and be able to manage the material risks that they face, which, over time, are likely to include climate-related financial risks,\" Powell said on April 3.\n\n\"We will remain alert to the risk that there will be pressure to expand that role over time.\"\n\nBanks used different approaches to develop the physical and transition risk scenarios required by the Fed and to translate these scenarios into climate-adjusted credit risk parameters.\n\nThey also noted the need to monitor changes across the insurance industry, including changes in insurance costs over time and the impacts of those changes on consumers and businesses in specific markets and segments.\n\nBanks' estimates of climate-adjusted credit risk parameters, such as probability of default, showed significant differences in impact across sectors, regions, and counterparties.\n\nThe exercise was exploratory in nature and does not have capital consequences.\n\nDrawing on lessons learned from the exercise, the Fed said it will continue to engage with participating banks regarding their capacity to measure and manage climate-related financial risks.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors":

The tests required each firm to gather and report data to the Fed which the agency used to draw conclusions.\n\nThe scenario models the impact of a severe hurricane in the Northeastern United States and one additional natural disaster elsewhere in the country -- chosen by the bank -- on each firm's residential and commercial real estate loan portfolios over the course of a year. The banks used their own models and assumptions to complete the exercise, and the results presented by those models were not independently verified by the Fed.\n\nThe scenario is broken into two 'modules' of risk associated with climate change. The physical risk module explored the damage inflicted on people and property as a result of shorter term climate events such as wildfires and floods as well as long-term climate change like sea-level rise. The second 'transition-risk' module refers to the stresses on various firms, sectors or regions resulting from policy changes, consumer or business sentiments or technologies arising from the ongoing transition to a lower carbon economy.\n\nAs part of the physical risk module, the banks estimated the impact of a hurricane in the Northeast U.S. -- a region where all six firms have significant exposure.\n\nUnder the most severe scenario, the Fed measured the impacts of climate change over a 200 year period and assumed properties are not insured. The report found that over 1,000 commercial loans and more than 238,000 residential loans in the Northeast would be impacted under such a scenario, representing 20% of commercial real estate loans and 50% of residential real estate loans.\n\nThe estimated probability of default for northeast properties spiked by 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively for commercial and residential loans, the study found. This represents about 20 and 50 percent of participants' total northeastern commercial and residential loans, respectively.\n\nA second component of the physical risk scenario asked banks to pick a region relevant to their real-estate holdings and perform analysis of the impact of a weather event of their choice. Such 'idiosyncratic' shocks had even more pronounced effects of default levels. Probability of default on the uninsured properties increased by 2.6 % for commercial and about 1.1% for residential real estate properties.\n\nThe Fed had banks assess the impact of transition risk by estimating the difference in the probability of loan defaults under current climate policies with a hypothetical scenario in 2050 where policies achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions. The average transition risk impact for CRE loans was about 1% across all property types, but the Fed's said participants reported significantly varying impacts depending on CRE property types.\n\nThe Fed first unveiled its climate scenario analysis test in 2022 to test how six of the largest banks respond to various climate-related stress scenarios. The 'exploratory' nature of the tests mean they have no imminent bearing on the banks' capital or regulatory requirements, but rather give regulators a snapshot of large banks' readiness to weather theoretical climate disruptions.\n\nThe tests -- implemented by Fed vice chair for supervision Michael Barr -- further one of the Biden Administrations top goals of addressing climate change. Barr's approach has been to ensure that banks understand climate risks without trying to steer market participants toward or away from specific activities.

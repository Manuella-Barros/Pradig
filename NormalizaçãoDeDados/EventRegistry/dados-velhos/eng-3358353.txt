Robert E. Lee from the Emancipation Park.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, died when a car with an Ohio license plate rammed into a crowd near the city's downtown mall after the rally at the city park was dispersed, according to reports. Heyers was one of the counterprotesters marching in jubilation near the mall after the white nationalists dispersed from the scene.\n\nCondolences poured in on social media, with many Twitter users saying Heyer died fighting against racism and hate.\n\nOne of the posts read: \"Rest in Power #HeatherHeyer we will remember and celebrate you and the legacies of other victims of hate as we continue to #resist.\" While another Twitter user said: \"Her name was Heather Heyer. Killed by a coward in cold blood. Thank you for your heroism Heather. You won't be forgotten. #Charlottesviille.\"\n\nMany Redditors also acknowledged that she died for a right cause. Here is one of the post.\n\nHer name was Heather Heyer. She was 32 years old. And she was killed by the madness of Trumpism that has swept across America. from ChapoTrapHouse\n\nAnother subreddit read: \"This is Heather Heyer. She gave her life today to resist White supremacist terror. Our president won't say her name, so we must. Say. Her. Name. (sic)\"\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, Heyer was working at the Miller Law Group PC in Virgina. Her last Facebook post read: \"If you are not outraged, you are not paying attention.\"\n\nSeveral fundraising campaigns were also started on the crowdsourcing website, Gofundme, to support Heyers' family. One of the pages, called \"Our Sister's Keeper #HeatherHeyer\" was created by Felicia Venita Correa from Charlottesville. It's description read: \"Heather Heyer was murdered while protesting against hate. We are raising money to give to her family for anything that they may need. She is a Greene County native and Graduated from William Monroe High School. She will truly be missed.\" The page mentioned a goal of raising $20,000 and has already managed to raise $23,653 at the time of publishing this article.\n\nNineteen other people were injured in the attack after the car driver, identified as James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, went on a rampage. According to reports, Fields was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and not stopping at the scene of a crash that resulted in a death.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in his statement about the violence in Charlottesville said: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides. It has been going on for a long time in our country -- not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America.\"\n\nHe also tweeted about Heyers saying:\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe also condemned the protests and said: \"It is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded without additional powers, and that the mostly-out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property.\"I am disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state.\"", "time": "08:10:00"}

The racist rally over the weekend was in response to the decision to remove the statues of Confederate leaders.\n\nAccording got the New York Daily News, the crash impact left Heyer lying on the pavement alongside another bloodied victim who was wearing a black shirt emblazoned with words of protest.\n\nCharlottesville Police Chief Alfred Thomas Jr. said during the press conference after the rally that the woman was killed while simply crossing the street at the wrong time.\n\nThe man believed to be behind the wheel, 20-year-old James Fields Jr., then sped the mangled sports car away in reverse. He was later arrested and charged in the attack, just hours after standing alongside members of the Vanguard America hate group during the rally.\n\nIt's unclear if Heyer was with demonstrators protesting the white supremacist rally that ended a short time earlier.\n\nHeyer's last public Facebook post suggested she had a reason to be downtown Saturday.\n\n\"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention,\" wrote Heyer.\n\n\"She died doing what was right. My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her,\" said Heyer's childhood friend Felicia Correa, who spoke on behalf of the victim's mother.\n\nCorrea learned of Heyer's death through her sister, another paralegal at the Charlottesville law firm.\n\n\"We grew up together. We lived on the same street, went to the same school, rode the bus together and played together,\" Correa said.\n\nAnother family member, Keri Vivona, was unable to speak fluidly when contacted by the media.\n\n\"Our family is trying to process this terrible tragedy,\" she said, according to the NYDN.\n\nCorrea said she plans to pay tribute to Heyer with a candlelight vigil at 7 p.m., Sunday, August 13, at Emancipation Park in Charlottesville.", "time": "15:07:00"}

A Crowdfunding page raising money for Heyer's family had raised more than $32,000 at the time of publication.\n\nThe page read: \"Heather Heyer was murdered while protesting against hate. Her mother said: 'She died doing what was right. My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her.' She will truly be missed.\"\n\nCol Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, told The Guardian that James Fields was \"charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump condemned the \"violence on many sides\" and was criticised for refusing to directly denounce the far-right demonstrators.\n\nOn Twitter, the president wrote: \"Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!\"\n\nRepublican Senator Cory Gardner said: \"Mr. President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism.\"", "time": "10:23:00"}

into a group of anti-racist demonstrators was \"murdered while protesting against hate,\" says a GoFundMe page set up by a family friend.\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe (D) confirmed her identity as Heather Heyer, 32, a paralegal who lived in Charlottesville. The GoFundMe page quotes Heyer's mother as saying her daughter \"died doing what was right. My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her.\"\n\nAs of late Sunday morning, more than $80,000 had been been pledged to the GoFundMe campaign. According to the page, Heyer was a graduate of Willam Monroe High School in Stanardsville, located about 25 miles north of Charlottesville.\n\nA neighbor of Heyer's, who declined to be named, said on Sunday morning that the woman was well known locally.\n\n\"All I can say is she lived her life like her path -- and it was for justice,\" the woman told HuffPost as she getting into her car. Outside the neighbor's home in the complex of duplex housing, a sign reads: \"This is a welcoming household. We love our neighbors who are immigrants, LGBT, people of color, living with a disability, Muslim, women, and survivors of sexual assault.

A witness said people flew into the air \"like they were just bowling pins.\"\n\n\"It was just terrifying,\" 23-year-old Thomas Pilnik told HuffPost.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Heyer had been \"crossing the street\" when she was killed. At least 19 others were injured in the crash, some critically, said police.\n\nMany took to Twitter to pay homage to Heyer. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), actress Janelle Monae and comedy writer Bess Kalb were among those who praised the young woman for her bravery and for standing up against hate.\n\nMany also noted the poignancy of Heyer's last public Facebook posting.\n\n\"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention,\" Heyer shared in November.\n\nThe victim, Heather Heyer, her last Facebook message read, \"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/oVctZ9jGCO -- Spits (@CallMeSpits)\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr., a 20-year-old Ohio man, is accused of driving the car that killed Heyer. He has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failing to stop at a crash resulting in a death, police said.\n\nFields' mother told the Associated Press that her son had told her last week he was going to a rally in Virginia, but that she didn't know its theme was white supremacy.\n\nA candlelit vigil is being planned for Heyer in Charlottesville on Sunday evening. Hundreds on Facebook have expressed their desire to attend.", "time": "16:03:00"}

Heather worked as a paralegal with the Miller Law Group, and now Heyer's Facebook page is collecting comments from those mourning her death and celebrating her life. According to the New York Daily News, 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. plowed through a crowd and mowed down about 20 people with his Dodge Challenger. Heyer was left bloodied on the pavement as others tried to save her life. Heather was crossing the street when she was killed, nearby counter-protesters walking down the narrow street.\n\nFields was arrested after the attack. While is isn't known if Heyer was with the people who were coming up against the white supremacists rallying on Saturday, August 12, folks are turning to Healther's Facebook page to get a glimpse of her beliefs. The most recent public Facebook post that Heather published featured Heyer sharing a Facebook message that claimed if a person wasn't outraged, they are not paying attention. Heyer's Facebook post is getting thousands of shares in the wake of her death. Heyer is collecting Facebook comments that praise her for fighting the good fight against hate and racism. Heyer's death has brought plenty of likes to her Facebook posts, which proclaim that ISIS should not be equated with all of Islam.\n\nAs seen in photos like the one below, hateful graffiti was written on the ground, with KKK written in chalk at the rally. Heyer's family is in the midst of trying to process the tragedy that took Heather's life, while the GoFundMe page named \"Our Sister's Keeper #HeatherHeyer\" has raised $73,073 of its $50,000 goal thus far. There is a candlelight tribute for Heather planned for Sunday evening at 7 p.m. at Emancipation Park.\n\nAs seen in the top photo above, a man who was demonstrating against the white nationalist party sprayed lighted flames at a white nationalist demonstrator.

Heather Heyer was killed by this madman, so get to know about this tragic victim.\n\n1. She died while protesting the \"Unite The Right\" rally. Heather Heyer, 32, was one of the many counter-protesters voicing their opposition to the \"Unite The Right\" rally on Aug. 12. The event was a collection of far-right demonstrators and white nationalists protesting the removal of Confederate monuments, specifically the moving of the Robert E. Lee statue from Emancipation Park. \"Heather Heyer was murdered while protesting against hate,\" a friend wrote on a GoFundMe.com page started for Heather, as she was killed when James Alex Fields Jr., 20, drove his gray Dodger Challenger down a narrow street lined with counter-protesters.\n\nHeather was crossing the street when she was hit, according to the New York Daily News. 19 other people were injured. \"[Heather] died doing what was right,\" her childhood friend, Felicia Correa, said while speaking on behalf of her friend's mother. \"My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her.\"\n\n2. She was a Virginia native. \"We grew up together. We lived on the same street, went to the same school, rode the bus together and played together,\" Felicia told the New York Daily News. Heather grew up in Green County, graduating from William Monroe High School. Her LinkedIn page said she worked as a paralegal at the Miller Law Group in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n3. Heather was politically active before her death. \"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.\" That quote, popular with political activists, adorns Heather's Facebook page. She often shared her political beliefs to Facebook, according to Heavy.com. During the 2016 presidential election, she shared a video about how if someone was scared of Muslim, they should actually meet a Muslim to end those fears. She also expressed her support for Bernie Sanders, 75, during the Democratic primary.\n\n4. She may not be the only one killed in that crash. As of Aug. 13, authorties at the UVA Health System said that five patients were in critical condition, four in serious condition, six in fair and four in good condition. Hopefully, they pull through. Two Virginia State Patrol troopers died in a helicopter crash while \"assisting public safety resources\" during the riot.\n\n5. Her friends and family plan to hold a tribute to Heather on August 13. In the wake of her tragic death, Heather's friend Felicia, along with her heartbroken friends, plan to hold a candlelight vigil for Heather at Emancipation Park at 7:00 PM ET. Other friends are encouraging people across the country to stand outside their homes at 10:00 PM ET with candles as both a demonstration against racism and in support of Heather.\n\nOur thoughts go out to Heather's family during their time of loss.", "time": "13:34:00"}

Heyer.\n\nAuthorities said 19 other pedestrians suffered injuries ranging from serious to minor.\n\nAs a girl, Heyer stood up for people being picked on while riding the schools bus.\n\nOn Saturday, she was killed standing up for her country, according to a childhood friend.\n\nHeyer was among those gathered in Charlottesville to oppose the neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and other white nationalists making a show of force in Charlottesville.\n\n\"People will remember her name and remember what she died for,\" said the friend, Felicia Correa.\n\nAn Ohio man was charged with second-degree murder after police said the Dodge Challenger he was driving \"at a high rate of speed\" rear-ended another car and pushed vehicles into a crowd of pedestrians. Police say the driver of the Challenger, James Alex Fields Jr., 20, fled the scene. He also was charged with three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit-and-run.\n\nCorrea said she recently was swamped with medical bills after complications related to her multiple sclerosis, so she went to a Charlottesville law firm. When Heyer, who was working as a paralegal there, walked out to meet her she was ecstatic to see the friend she had known growing up in Greene County, Va.\n\nHeyer jumped in and guided Correa, who was uninsured and is a mother of six, through the daunting financial process. When Correa heard Heyer had been killed Saturday, she said she wanted to help her family, just like their daughter helped her a few months ago.\n\nHeyer was a \"young white woman who died standing up not just for people of color in general but, also the people of color that I love, that I worry about,\" Correa said.\n\n\"She died for a reason. I don't see any difference in her or a soldier who died in war. She, in a sense, died for her country. She was there standing up for what was right,\" Correa said. \"I just want to make sure that it wasn't in vain.\"", "time": "16:29:00"}

She was only 32 and was killed while crossing the street during the protests, taking a stand against racism and hate. The counter protesters, carrying LGBTQ flags and Black Lives Matter signs, were demonstrating against a group of alt-right who had rallied together to protest the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue. The night before, the alt-right group had carried torches in protest, ramping up the tensions in the area.\n\nHeyer was tragically caught in the middle of one driver's unexpected turn toward violence. Now, her supporters are asking everyone to light a candle and stand outside their home in her honor, showing they are standing against hate on Sunday night at 10 p.m. Eastern.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHeather Heyer was part of the counter protest group that was hit by the Ohio driver, while taking a stand against hate. She is a native of Greene County and graduated from William Monroe High School. She was a paralegal, International Business Times reported. According to her LinkedIn, she worked for Miller Law Group PC in Virginia as a legal assistant. She died doing what she believed in: speaking out against injustice, racism, and hate.\n\nShe was a Bernie supporter in 2016 and was open about those political views on her Facebook wall.\n\nAccording to witnesses, the counter protesters were hit as they turned a corner during their protest march. They were chanting things like \"our streets\" in response to the words \"Unite the Right.\" This happened after police had dispersed a group of white nationalists, CBS reported.\n\nWitnesses referred to the crash as a \"deliberate act of terrorism,\" which the Charlottesville Police Chief echoed in his press conference that you can watch below:\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe had declared a state of emergency in the city because of violence that was breaking out. In fact, a group of white nationalists had just been dispersed shortly before the car rammed into the counter protesters, many of whom were carrying LBTQ flags and Black Lives Matters signs.\n\nLater, many public officials spoke out against any white supremacists who were involved in the rally.\n\nAlt-right demonstrators were protesting the city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park.\n\nFriends of Heyer's family have set up a GoFundMe to help them during this terrible time. You can donate here. As of the time of publication, $26,002 was raised of a $50,000 goal, with 984 people donating.\n\nOn the GoFundMe, a friend shared:\n\nAs of 7:45 p.m. Eastern, $61,972 had already been contributed toward a $75,000 goal. You can contribute to the GoFundMe here.\n\nHeather Heyer didn't hide who she was or her desire to take a stand against injustice. Even the quote on her Facebook cover photo read: \"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.\"\n\nShe often posted on Facebook, standing up for others. She shared a video before the election about how if a person was scared of a Muslim, they should meet a Muslim to end those fears.\n\nShe was very outspoken about her beliefs, including posting a review of a police department on Facebook in 2016, upset about a woman that she said had been assaulted.\n\nMany have flocked to Heather's Facebook page to share their grief in her loss and their solidarity to continue taking a stand for her beliefs.\n\nOne person, Michael Bullard, wrote:\n\nWe can't let this be for nothing people. We have to take her spirit of resistance with us wherever we go. Let this be the catalyst in our lives for real change. Rest in peace. We'll take it from here.\"\n\nIn addition to Heather's tragic death, 19 were injured from the crash, with an additional 15 people injured in the rally itself. Later, two more people died in a helicopter crash. As of early Saturday evening, UVA Health System shared that five patients were in critical condition, four in serious condition, six in fair condition, and four more in good condition.\n\nThe suspect, James Alex Fields Jr., is in custody. He was booked and charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, failure to stop for an accident involving a death, and hit-and-run, Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail Superintendent Martin Kumer told The Washington Post. Fields is 20 years old.\n\nFriends and admirers of Heather are urging everyone to stand outside their homes at 10 p.m. Easter on Sunday night (tonight) with lit candles, to show everyone across the world that they oppose racism and they oppose fascism.", "time": "08:35:00"}

people protesting against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville was named on Sunday as Heather Heyer, a 32 year old legal assistant with a law firm in Virginia, who repeatedly championed civil rights issues on social media.\n\nHeyer, whose Facebook cover photo read: \"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention\", worked for the Virginia law firm Miller Law, and regularly drew attention to cases of police malpractice and racism, as well as posting her support for Bernie Sanders in his presidential campaign.\n\nA friend from childhood, Felicia Correa, who launched a crowdfunding page and said she was speaking for Heyer's mother, who was not ready to speak in public, said: \"She died doing what was right. My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her.\"\n\nHowever, it was testimony to the bitterness of the local situation that among scores of tributes to Heyer's principles and courage, several people posted comments laying equal blame on the anti-racist and civil rights groups as on the neo-Nazi and far right groups whose planned rally they were demonstrating against.\n\nThe crowdfunding page to raise money for her family has already far exceeded its $50,000 target, with almost 3,000 people donating within 11hours, many leaving tributes describing her as a hero. Sheryl Hodge wrote: \"We are so sad and outraged. We will not let Heather go in vain,\" and George Christos: \"Very sad that our country continues to see this hatred and that a young life was lost as a result.\"\n\nHer friends were also organising a candlelit vigil in her memory on Sunday night.\n\nHeyer came from Greene County, one of the smallest counties in Virginia, where she graduated from William Monroe high school - motto \"Every child, every chance, every day\" - and kept in touch with her alumni from the class of 2003. The school was originally founded from money left by William Monroe, an 18th-century immigrant from England, to provide free education for white children, but it now posts a firm commitment on its website against discrimination \"on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age in its programs and activities\".\n\nHeyer's second last Facebook post, in October 2016, was a link to a site urging those fearful of Muslims to meet and befriend one. Since it was still open, hundreds of people added comments to it, most expressing admiration for her and condolences to her family, but a few - who instantly attracted outraged reactions - blamed her for being at the rally.", "time": "16:19:00"}

deadly, Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer expressed his displeasure with how Donald Trump carried himself during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\"Old saying: when you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change, the devil changes you,\" Signer said on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" Sunday morning, explaining why he previously said on Saturday that he hopes President Trump \"looks himself in the mirror and thinks very deeply about who he consorted with.\"\n\n\"I think they made a choice in that campaign,\" Signer continued. \"A very regrettable one, to really go to people's prejudices, to go to the gutter.\"\n\nSinger believes \"these influences around the country, these anti-Semites, racists, Aryans, neo-Nazis, KKK,\" people who were \"always in the shadows,\" have \"been given a key and a reason to come into the light.\"\n\n\"The time has come for this to stop,\" the mayor said. \"This should be a turning point. This movement jumped the shark and it happened yesterday. People are dying and I do think that it's now on the president and on all of us to say 'enough is enough.'\"\n\nGatherings of white nationalists violently clashed with counter-protesters on Saturday, and one person was killed and 19 others were injured when a car plowed through a crowd of counter-demonstrators.\n\nPresident Trump is facing widespread criticism from both parties for suggesting that \"many sides\" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville.\n\nThe car crash was \"a clear terrorist attack with a car used as a weapon,\" Signer said.\n\nSigner also released the name of the woman who killed when a driver rammed his car into a group of anti-racist protesters demonstrating against an alt-right and white nationalist rally. He identified her as Heather Heyer, 32.\n\nHe also mentioned the two state troopers who died in a helicopter crash near the demonstrations.\n\n\"I have to start with a moment of reflection about our prayers going out to the families of Jay Cullen and Berke Bates, Virginia State Police,\" Singer said on the TODAY Show.\n\n\"[And] Heather Heyer who passed away in that horrific car attack. I mean we're a grieving city. Three people died who didn't have to die. So we're praying for them and their families and loved ones.\"\n\nHeyer was killed and more than 19 others were injured in the attack. Five were in critical condition, four in serious condition, six are fair and four are in good condition, on Saturday night.\n\nOn Saturday night, police said James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Ohio, was the man arrested for plowing into the crowd.\n\nHe has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of \"hit and run attended failure to stop with injury.\"", "time": "14:07:00"}

He also was charged with three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit-and-run.\n\nCharlottesville city officials said in a statement on Sunday that Ms Heyer \"was struck down by a vehicle while exercising her peaceful first-amendment right to speech. This senseless act of violence rips a hole in our collective hearts.\"\n\nMs Correa said she recently was swamped with medical bills after complications related to her multiple sclerosis, so she went to a Charlottesville law firm. When Ms Heyer, who was working as a paralegal there, walked out to meet her she was ecstatic to see the friend she had known growing up in Greene County, Virginia. Ms Heyer jumped in and guided Ms Correa, who was uninsured and is a mother of six, through the daunting financial process.\n\nMs Heyer was a \"young white woman who died standing up not just for people of colour in general but, also the people of colour that I love, that I worry about,\" said Ms Correa, who is biracial.\n\n\"She died for a reason. I don't see any difference in her or a soldier who died in war. She, in a sense, died for her country. She was there standing up for what was right.\n\n\"I just want to make sure that it wasn't in vain.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump was under fire on Sunday for what critics said was his weak response to the protests.\n\nMr Trump refused to single out the white nationalist movement at the centre of the protests, instead criticising violence \"on may sides.\"\n\nUpdate on Fatal Charlottesville Traffic Crash pic.twitter.com/UM1HQdy3CK -- Charlottesville City (@CvilleCityHall)\n\n13 August 2017\n\nThe picture emerging of Ms Heyer contrasted to that of the man allegedly responsible for her death.\n\nThe accused driver, James Alex Fields jnr, was reportedly well known for his Nazi sympathies, according to Derek Weimer, who taught Fields history at Randall K. Cooper High School in Kentucky.\n\n\"It was obvious that he had this fascination with Nazism and a big idolatry of Adolf Hitler,\" Mr Weimer said. \"He had white supremacist views. He really believed in that stuff.\"\n\n\"When you're a teacher and you see one of your former students do this, it's a nightmare scenario.\n\n\"This was something that was growing in him. I admit I failed. I tried my best. But this is definitely a teachable moment and something we need to be vigilant about because this stuff is tearing up our country.\"\n\nVideo recorded at the scene of the crash shows the 2010 Dodge Challenger accelerating into crowds on a pedestrian mall, sending bodies flying - and then reversing at high speed, hitting more people.\n\nWitnesses said the street was filled with people opposed to the white nationalists, who had come to town bearing Confederate flags and anti-Semitic epithets.\n\nBrian Moran, Virginia secretary of public safety, described the incident as a terrorist attack.\n\nThe FBI field office in Richmond and the US Attorney's Office in the Western District of Virginia said late on Saturday that they had opened a civil rights investigation into the deadly crash.\n\n\"The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice,\" US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.\n\n\"When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nRecords show Fields last lived in Maumee, Ohio, south-west of Toledo.\n\nHis father was killed by a drunk driver a few months before the boy's birth, according to an uncle who spoke on the condition of anonymity. His father left him money that the uncle kept in a trust until Fields reached adulthood.\n\n\"When he turned 18, he demanded his money, and that was the last I had any contact with him,\" the uncle said.\n\nFields, he said, grew up mostly in Northern Kentucky, where he'd been raised by a single mother who was a paraplegic.\n\nRichard Spencer, a leader in the white supremacist movement who coined the term \"alt-right,\" said he didn't know Fields but had been told he was a member of Vanguard America, which bills itself as the \"Face of American Fascism.\"\n\nIn a statement tweeted on Saturday night, the group denied any connection to Fields.\n\nIn several images that circulated online, he was photographed with the group while wearing its unofficial uniform. Like members, he was dressed in a white polo, baggy khakis and sunglasses, while holding a black shield that features a common Vanguard symbol.\n\n\"The shields seen do not denote membership, nor does the white shirt,\" the group said in its statement. \"The shields were freely handed out to anyone in attendance.\"\n\nVanguard members did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday.\n\nAlso on Saturday, two state police officers died when their helicopter crashed on the outskirts of town. Berke M.M. Bates, 40, of Quinton, Virginia, was the pilot, and H. Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, was a passenger, according to officials.\n\nOn Sunday morning, one day after Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, he and Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam attended a service at Mount Zion First African Baptist Church.\n\nThe Governor brought the predominantly African American congregation to its feet as he stood at the pulpit and condemned \"the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who came to our state yesterday.\"\n\n\"You pretend you're patriots. You are not patriots. You are dividers,\" he said, then later, his voice roaring: \"Shame on you!\"\n\nAt the church service, Gov. McAuliffe said he was close to both of the officers who had died.\n\nTheir deaths, he said, had enraged him, but he'd tried to move beyond that emotion and asked the congregation to do the same.\n\n\"Let us use today to reach out to our fellow citizens, put your hand out to help them,\" he said. \"Let us show these people that we are bigger than them, we are stronger than them.\"\n\nSaturday's 'Unite the Right' rally was meant to be a protest against the planned removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The city of Charlottesville voted to remove the statue earlier this year, but it remains in Emancipation Park, formerly known as Lee Park, pending a judge's ruling expected later this month.\u200b\n\nNaundi Cook, 23, who is black, said that she came to Saturday's counter-protests to \"support my people\" but that she had never seen something like this before.\n\nWhen violence broke out, she started shaking and got goose bumps.\n\n\"I've seen people walking around with tear gas all over their face, all over their clothes. People getting Maced, fighting,\" she said. \"I didn't want to be next.\"\n\nMs Cook said she couldn't sit back and watch white nationalists descend on her town. She has a three-year-old daughter to stand up for, she said.\n\n\"Right now, I'm not sad,\" she said once the protests dispersed. \"I'm a little more empowered. All these people and support, I feel like we're on top right now because of all the support that we have.\"\n\nThe Washington Post", "timeCrawl": "18:06:00", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-13", "textStart": 5117, "amb": false, "textEnd": 5131}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8950715", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "id": 72, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "id": 333, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "id": 705, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "id": 811, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}], "page": 1, "pages": 37, "totalResults": 37}}}

Wearing Darcy's trademark suit and tie, Firth tenderly places his hand upon the cheek of his co-star, who is in an emerald dress and leather boots.\n\nBecause Fielding's Mad About The Boy novel had Bridget navigating life as a widow four years after Darcy's death, Firth's return is a huge surprise, which film bosses were desperate to keep under wraps.\n\nA source said: 'Colin was always going to appear in the movie but it was supposed to be a secret.'\n\nIt's not the first time tragedy has beset the fictional diarist. In the last movie, Bridget Jones's Baby, she is seen attending the memorial of her other on-off love Daniel Cleaver, played by Hugh Grant, who is presumed dead after a plane crash. He is later found alive.\n\nBut filming was abruptly stopped when bat experts raised concerns about the local bat population and how they were being affected by filming\n\nBridget (played by Renee Zellweger) and Mr Darcy (portrayed by Colin Firth) nose to nose in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\n\nIn the last movie, Bridget Jones's Baby, she is seen attending the memorial of her other on-off love Daniel Cleaver, played by Hugh Grant , who is presumed dead after a plane crash\n\nFormer flame Daniel Cleaver, and a young man named Rockstar played by Leo Woodhall (pictured as Dexter in One Day) will face off for Bridget's love\n\nFans will have to be patient to find out whether Darcy will be so lucky, or is simply appearing in a dream sequence.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year that Jones will face a three-way battle for her affections between Cleaver, a much younger man named Rockstar, played by One Day heartthrob Leo Woodall, and 12 Years A Slave star Chiwetel Ejiofor's character, Mr Walker.\n\nBridget, now a mother of two, will become smitten with Mr Walker, who teaches PE at her son's school, before diverting her attentions to the hunky Rockstar, who she meets on social media.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday previously revealed that Bridget will give up her famous bachelorette pad in London's Borough Market in favour of a family home in leafy Hampstead, North London, where so many scenes have been filmed in the past few months.\n\nIn the film, due out on Valentine's Day next year, Bridget also quits her job working in television to do the school run, with comical scenes expected as she struggles to keep up with the Yummy Mummies.\n\nThe character of Mark Darcy is said to have been inspired by Keir Starmer when he was working as a human rights lawyer in the 1990s.

Ren\u00e9e Zellweger & Hugh Grant returning to reprise their roles in the new installment, along with new faces Chiwetel Ejiofor & Isla Fisher. Plot details for Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy remain a mystery, promising a mix of sadness and comedy, with a U.S. Peacock release on Feb 14, 2025.\n\nEverything is set for the fourth installment of the Bridget Jones franchise, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, set to release on Valentine's Day 2025. The sequel will be bringing back some familiar faces, including that of Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who stars in the titular role. Others who are set to return and reprise their roles within the franchise are Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson. Production on the highly anticipated sequel has been on for a while now. However, in a bit of news that is sure to send shivers of joy down the spines of the Bridget Jones fandom, it has been revealed that the upcoming feature has officially wrapped filming. The announcement made by the film's production banner, Working Title Films, is sure to bring the film's premiere into sharp focus, as highlighted by its caption. \"That's a wrap. See you on Valentine's Day,\" it read.\n\nBased on Helen Fielding's book series, in particular, the 2013 novel, the upcoming feature is set to follow on from the events of the events of Bridget Jones's Baby. In the prior installment, Bridget is married to Colin Firth's Mark, a happy ending for her while a plane crash is presumed to have claimed Daniel's (Grant) life. Now, Bridget sees her luck turn, and not for the better, as she has recently been widowed and forced to return to the dating scene once more. In her early fifties and trying to juggle the modern complexities of life, work and being a single mother, Bridget will continue to pursue her earnest search for love, and we are all here to lend support.\n\n'Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy' Will Be A Nostalgic Affair Close\n\nBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy will be directed by Michael Morris, from a script penned by franchise author Fielding alongside Abi Morgan and Dan Mazer. Beyond Zellweger, Grant, and Thompson reprising their roles, the upcoming feature will see the addition of new faces, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Isla Fisher and Leo Woodall. Other returning cast members include Celia Imrie, Neil Pearson and Joanna Scanlan. The list extends to include Sarah Solemani, James Callis, Sally Phillips, and Shirley Henderson as Bridget's close friends. Back to portray her parents are Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones. With so many familiar faces returning, the upcoming feature is setting up to be a nostalgic watch.\n\nNot much has been given with regard to exact plot details for Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy. Beyond what we know from the novel, there is airtight information with the character details for newcomers remaining a mystery. Last month, returning star, Grant, attempted to offer a bit of insight into what is to come. \"It's based on trying to bring up two children alone, and then [it's] all mixed up in the Bridget Jones [style] comedy, so it's very sad, as well as very funny,\" Grant said. \"It has me in tears.\"\n\nBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy will arrive on Peacock in the U.S. on Valentine's Day, February 14, 2025, and will be simultaneously released in theatres around the world on the same day. Stay tuned to Collider for further updates. Bridget Jones' Diary is available to stream on Max.\n\nBridget Jones's Diary\n\nBridget, a single woman in her thirties, embarks on a mission to overhaul her life by keeping a diary, where she records her resolutions, romantic entanglements, and professional aspirations. Her love life becomes a rollercoaster as she juggles the attentions of her charming but roguish boss and a seemingly cold but earnest family friend. Amidst comedic blunders and poignant reflections, Bridget's journey highlights themes of self-discovery and genuine love. The film offers a witty and heartwarming portrayal of personal growth and the complexities of relationships in the contemporary world.\n\nRelease Date April 13, 2001 Director Sharon Maguire Cast

The book, released 17 years after the first novel -- a worldwide sensation -- sees the titular character navigate parenthood as a single mother with a toy boy to boot. While some fans are excited, others are questioning whether we need another film about the beloved yet messy character.\n\nWhen Bridget Jones's Diary was published in 1996, plenty of readers were enamoured by the hilarious ramblings of the 30-something protagonist, who shamelessly declares her unloveable-ness, slags off her friend's boyfriends, complains about her mother's affair and new career ventures, and pines over several men. With almost every diary entry, she tallies up her calorie intake, alcohol units consumed, cigarettes smoked, weight, and sometimes, the number of 1471 calls she's made in the hopes of it being a certain romantic interest.\n\nIt perfectly encapsulates the era of post-feminism that seemed particularly prominent in the mid-1990s, when many women felt that feminist aims had been achieved. Many women saw themselves as go-getters -- career-driven, single, ambitious, and financially independent. Bridget fits the mould, working in a publishing job with a flat in central London, where she lives alone. She regularly goes out for drinks with her friends, can drive herself about, and doesn't have anyone to worry about apart from herself.\n\nYet, post-feminism has always taken a very one-dimensional view of women's rights, ignoring the countless women who can't 'have it all'. It ignores the staggering rates of sexual harassment, rape, femicide and career-related inequalities, which are very pertinent issues which have never disappeared, even when second-wave feminism helped to liberate many women from the trappings of traditional domesticity.\n\nThus, Bridget Jones (and its 2001 film adaptation) takes on an interesting legacy. Fielding's character upholds some questionable values and beliefs that are clearly a product of their time, but the novel and the film do little to counteract these issues. The character is driven by her desire for a husband (it's all she talks about), and while this is a natural impulse for many women - we want to be loved and admired - Bridget can't get potential male suitors out of her mind, seemingly ever.\n\nIt becomes her main goal in life: to have a comfortable relationship where mini-breaks and spontaneous shagging are the defining characteristics of the agreement. At the same time, Bridget is so witty and effortlessly hilarious that it's hard not to love her and relate to her neuroses. Whether she's belting out 'All By Myself', failing to cook a good meal and accidentally turning soup blue, drowning her singleness in wine, or freaking out over her lack of experience when applying for a new job, Bridget is certainly a relatable modern woman.\n\nShe is completely flawed; she calls herself fat despite being nine stone and even drinks enough units to be considered a borderline alcoholic. In the film adaptation, Renee Zellweger is charming as the protagonist, and it's easy to see why so many women have come to identify with the character as she navigates the harsh realities of a world where women are more independent than ever, yet certain issues (such as beauty standards, the looming pressures of marriage and a 'dwindling body clock') constantly muddle day-to-day life.\n\nIt's her complete surrender to chaos and the ups and downs of womanhood that makes reading or watching Bridget Jones so enjoyable. We can't help but laugh when her pervy boss, Daniel Cleaver, discovers her granny pants during sex or when she finds herself trapped among yuppie couples who try and set her up with their single male friends.\n\nDespite the humour and charm of Bridget Jones, the postfeminist elements, which, granted, feel like an accurate encapsulation of the time, aren't challenged. Bridget's obsession with weight is harmful, especially when she is presented as a very slim woman, and her quest for a man (which she succeeds at) sees her fall back into the traditional stereotypes that her parents and family friends want her to adhere to.\n\nBridget Jones suggests that women needn't worry - you can be happy if you obsess over finding the right man, even if that means sacrificing other joy-inducing hobbies and interests and clinging to the ideal nuclear family set-up instead. While there is nothing wrong with getting into a relationship, of course, the book/film seems to suggest that it is the ultimate goal, the ultimate level of fulfilment we should all strive for. Bridget also jokes about being sexually harassed by her boss, and while we're meant to find Daniel Cleaver a slimy pervert, his misogyny and abuses of power are typically played for comic relief.\n\nDespite its many flaws, Bridget Jones's Diary and its sequel, The Edge of Reason, remain fan favourites, and it's easy to see why. The quotable lines, loveable characters who are far from perfect, and the general cosiness that the books and films emit have garnered a dedicated following. The 2016 film Bridget Jones' Baby, on the other hand, saw Bridget bump into Ed Sheeran (awful) and attempt to figure out who her baby daddy is, suggesting that the franchise should be left in the past.\n\nThe first two books and films were products of their time, yes, but they've endured for their relatability, which Bridget Jones' Baby just doesn't have. It feels like an impersonation of Bridget Jones, attempting to cater to both old fans and a new audience. A fourth Bridget Jones movie seems like the wrong choice for the franchise, but only time will tell whether Bridget's dated beliefs, dieting obsessions, and flimsy feminism will be ditched or adapted for modern audiences.\n\nFor now, Bridget Jones is best enjoyed in its earlier forms, as long as we go into the books and films with an awareness of their datedness and the mental reminder not to hold oneself to the same standards as our complex and hilariously chaotic protagonist.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aimee_ferrier@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Aimee Ferrier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridget Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfeminism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Postfeminism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Fielding", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helen Fielding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones's_Diary_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridget Jones's Diary (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Title character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_parent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single parent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calorie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-wave_feminism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second-wave feminism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren\u00e9e_Zellweger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neurosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drowning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ed Sheeran"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/08/The-complex-yet-enduring-legacy-of-Bridget-Joness-Diary-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804038", "eventUri": "eng-9804038", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

So, it brought us a ton of joy when we learned a few months back that another one of Helen Fielding's novels from the series was being adapted! Ahead of the rom-com joining the 2025 movie schedule, the production has finished rolling cameras, and now they're celebrating.\n\nWorking Title Films, which has been responsible for all the hilarious Bridget Jones movies, took to Twitter on Thursday to share an exciting photo from set to celebrate the production finishing up filming. Take a look:\n\nHow exciting! The post features an image of what we'd assume is Ren\u00e9e Zellweger's chair on set alongside some monitors set up on the location of the new Bridget Jones movie. The company shared with audiences that we'll see what they've made on Valentine's Day. What a perfect date to venture back into the love life of the beloved British character who is inspired by Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.\n\nAs we previously learned, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger will be playing Bridget Jones for the fourth time in an adaptation of Helen Fielding's 2013 book, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy. It will also see the return of Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver for the first time since 2004's Edge of Reason. He didn't want to be in the third movie, Bridget Jones's Baby, but this time is a different story. Plus, the end of the 2016 movie showed Bridget finding out Daniel is alive, after all.\n\nEmma Thompson is also reprising her role as Dr. Rawlings (from the third movie), plus Chiwetel Ejiofor and One Day and White Lotus' Leo Woodall will make their debuts in the film series. Colin Firth is not expected to return, and as fans of the book may know, Mark Darcy actually tragically dies in the Mad About The Boy novel. Even so, we're hoping the actor finds himself in the movie somehow. Firth has turned down a Bridget Jones movie before, only to change his mind, so who knows!\n\nThe Mad About The Boy novel, which is being adapted by Fielding herself alongside Abi Morgan and Dan Mazer and director Michael Morris, will follow Bridget as a 51-year-old single mother and widow who is navigating a sexual relationship with a younger man (who we imagine will be played by Woodall). This time Bridget also uses social media a lot more to express her feelings rather than an analog diary.\n\nUnfortunately for American audiences, the new Bridget Jones movie is only going to those with a Peacock subscription on February 14th, whereas international fans will have the ability to check it out in theaters. However, we can't help but be thrilled about this film.\n\nI don't know about you, but seeing Bridget and Daniel's reunion in Mad About The Boy just made the first draft of my 2025 New Year's resolution.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_el_mahmoud@cinemablend.com", "name": "Sarah El-Mahmoud", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridget Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren\u00e9e_Zellweger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Fielding", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helen Fielding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones's_Diary_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridget Jones's Diary (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_Title_Films", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Working Title Films"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emma Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pride and Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jane Austen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Firth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colin Firth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Mazer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Mazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abi_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abi Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fielding", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry Fielding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiwetel_Ejiofor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chiwetel Ejiofor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hZfWRfyAstPzXPp9HPSKLH-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804038", "eventUri": "eng-9804038", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-14", "textStart": 2498, "textEnd": 2511}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

An insider told The Sun in June: 'Filming for the scenes might not start again until at least July, so the schedule has taken a hit.\n\n'They've got a tight window, especially with having to work around the busy diaries of A-listers. It's a disaster.'\n\nDespite this 'disaster', it seems that the filmmakers have revealed when the film will be released - and it's totally on schedule!\n\nSharing a shot that revealed they had wrapped filming, Working Films revealed on social media: 'That's a wrap. See you on Valentine's Day.'\n\nFans were delighted with the news that they will only have to wait for a few more months until the latest instalment is released and took to Instagram to share their excitement.\n\n'LITERALLY SCREAMING,' said __alyssa__15 in the comment section.\n\nOther fans joked that they couldn't wait for months. 'Oh come the f**k on Bridget...' commented dean.gambleharverson, quoting the first film.\n\nAnother fan demanded more information about the movie: 'Any teasers ? Love to see a clip,' said godwardjanet.\n\nThe fourth movie will focus on Bridget's life with her children and venture back into romance after her husband Mark Darcy - played by Colin Firth - dies.\n\nThe film is set to star White Lotus and One Day breakout star Leo Woodall as Bridget's toyboy love interest which will delight fans who loved him in previous romantic roles.\n\nHugh Grant has also surprised fans after ducking out of the third movie as his character Daniel Cleaver returns from the grave.\n\nHugh has been snapped filming for the upcoming movie and set the expectations high for this film as he revealed to ET: 'I'll tell you what, I think this script for the fourth Bridget is the best one of the four. And, in fact, one of the best scripts I have read for in a long time.'\n\nBridget Jones Mad About The Boy is set to be released February 14, 2025.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we'd love to hear from you.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_harman@metro.co.uk", "name": "Laura Harman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SEI_199456163-baf2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C29px%2C2494px%2C1313px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804038", "eventUri": "eng-9804038", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-02-", "textStart": 2666, "textEnd": 2677}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The pool in Portsmouth is not giving. I've tried dating, speaking to people on social media and it just hasn't been successful. Applying was a spontaneous thing, I didn't expect to get here! WHAT WILL YOU BRING TO THE VILLA? My girls are my rocks and I'm theirs so I'll be a good friend as well as going in there to find a man. I like dressing up so I'll bring style, and I'd like to think I'm quite funny so I'll make people laugh. Bringing honesty as well - I'm good at picking up on people's personality traits and side-eyeing those who might be a liar. NAME: Patsy Field AGE: 29 FROM: Orpington OCCUPATION: Office Administrator WHAT DO YOU WANT THE ISLANDERS TO KNOW? I've got something very special about me which is my disability, it's a condition I was born with called Ebs Palsy. It doesn't define who I am , but it makes me a little different, although I've learnt to get on with it and it's never held me back. HOW WOULD FRIENDS/FAMILY DESCRIBE YOU? My friends would say that I'm the loudest person in the group, I'm the one who's always up for doing a dare, the life and soul of the party. My family would say that I'm bossy and that it's always my way or the highway, they'd say I rule the roost. NAME: Sean Stone AGE: 24 FROM: Hertford OCCUPATION: Sweet Salesman WHY LOVE ISLAND? I've always been one for relationships and when you have found someone you want to be with it's the best feeling. Now is the perfect time, the one thing that is missing is my soulmate. HOW WOULD FRIENDS/FAMILY DESCRIBE YOU? Very loving, caring and thoughtful. I'm the kind of guy that if you broke down on the motorway and needed your tyre changed, I'd be there at any time of night. NAME: Harriett Blackmore AGE: 24 FROM: Brighton OCCUPATION: Dancer & Personal Shopper WHAT WILL YOU BRING TO THE VILLA? I'll bring the entertainment for everyone in the Villa, whether that's making the girls laugh or making the boys turn their heads, I'm sure that I'll bring the drama. CLAIM T0 FAME? Being a bit of an IT girl in Brighton, I've done personal shopping for the rapper Arrdee and one of my best friends is Saffron Barker the YouTuber. NAME: Ayo Odukoya AGE: 25 FROM: Canning Town OCCUPATION: Model WHAT WILL YOU BRING TO THE VILLA? I think I'd bring excitement and joy. I think people would have someone to come to and talk to and feel comfortable being around or to have a laugh with. I think I'm somebody everyone would take to. WHY SHOULD SOMEBODY DATE YOU? I feel like the way I carry myself is very respectful and I think people take to that and once you show who you are to somebody you get it back tenfold. The way I am gives off a good enough energy for people to feel comfortable around me. NAME: Samantha Kenny AGE: 26 FROM: Liverpool OCCUPATION: Makeup Artist WHAT WILL YOU BRING TO THE VILLA? I think I will definitely bring some fire, I'm very opinionated and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm really bubbly too so I'll definitely have a laugh as well as bringing some scouse glamour. WHY ARE YOU SINGLE? I don't get out enough, I work weekends and tend to not go out in Liverpool anymore. If I want a night out I go down to London as I love the boys down south. Tall, dark and cockney is my type. NAME: Munveer Jabbal AGE: 30 FROM: Surbiton, Surrey OCCUPATION: Recruitment Manager WHY ARE YOU SINGLE? CLAIM T0 FAME?

I've enjoyed being able to go on holiday with the girls and not having to worry about someone back home. All the girls are there texting in their room and I'm out till 4 in the morning living my best life. WHAT IS SOMETHING NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT YOU?

I don't underestimate the fact that I'm hard work. I know what I want and I'm not easily pleased. When you're a loud, outgoing woman, sometimes it can intimidate men - men don't always want that. WHAT'S YOUR TYPE ON PAPER? I love a set of white Turkey teeth but a good set of Turkey teeth. I would say personality traits, you have to be family orientated. You have to be tall, you can't be shorter than me, I can't be having to question whether I can wear heels around you and what height of heels I can wear. If you're vertically challenged, it's not for me. NAME: Ciaran Davies AGE: 21 FROM: Pencoed, South Wales OCCUPATION: Surveyor WHAT'S YOUR TYPE ON PAPER? Obviously looks but humour is a big thing for me, I'm a bit of a wind up so I want a girl who can give it back.

NAME: Grace Jackson AGE: 25 FROM: Manchester OCCUPATION: Model and social media marketing coordinator WHY ARE YOU SINGLE? No guys have good communication and it's painful. I like someone who doesn't take themselves and life too seriously. My lifestyle can put guys off a little bit, I like to go out and go abroad a lot. They can't keep up with my lifestyle.

In 2023, the company reported $2.5 billion in revenue.\n\nAccording to an 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dropbox detected \"unauthorized access\" on April 24, 2024.\n\nThe San Francisco, California-based company responded by activating its incident response to contain and mitigate the incident and launching an investigation to determine its scope. It also reset users' passwords, logged out connected devices, and began rotating all API keys and OAuth tokens.\n\nAccording to its investigation, the cloud storage provider believes the threat actor compromised a Dropbox Sign automated system configuration tool and gained privileges to execute applications in the eSignature's production environment.\n\n\"The actor compromised a service account that was part of Sign's back-end, which is a type of non-human account used to execute applications and run automated services,\" the company said in a data breach notification posted on its website.\n\nThe threat actor then used their access to compromise a Dropbox customer database and access personal information, including emails, usernames, phone numbers, and account settings.\n\nSecurity breach impacts all Dropbox Sign eSignature users\n\nDropbox determined that the security breach impacted all its eSignature platform users, including those without an account.\n\n\"Upon further investigation, we discovered that the threat actor had accessed data related to all users of Dropbox Sign, such as emails and usernames, in addition to general account settings,\" Dropbox told the SEC.\n\nIn some cases, the threat actor accessed \"phone numbers, hashed passwords, and certain authentication information such as API keys, OAuth tokens, and multi-factor authentication.\"\n\n\"This breach is especially significant since API keys and OAuth tokens were compromised,\" said Ray Kelly, Fellow, Synopsys Software Integrity Group. \"Often times, API keys are static and do not change so that organisations can automate their processes around their services. When these keys are compromised, a malicious actor can gain access to services that can be sensitive or cause monetary consequences for the victim.\"\n\nDropbox disclosed that the eSignature platform's security breach also exposed the names and email addresses of individuals \"who received or signed a document through Dropbox Sign but never created an account.\"\n\nHowever, Dropbox's investigation determined that the threat actor never \"accessed the contents of users' accounts, such as their agreements or templates, or their payment information.\"\n\nBusinesses use eSignature platforms such as Dropbox Sign to send highly confidential documents such as agreements, contracts, and transactions. Exposing that information could severely affect their operations and expose them to various cyber risks.\n\n\"This breach of Dropbox Sign customer information and authentication information creates risk for users of that system,\" said Jason Soroko, Senior Vice President of Product at Sectigo. \"People who use e-signatures are typically trained to follow processes and, unfortunately, this can be an advantage for the attackers who now have their contact information.\"\n\nNathaniel Jones, the Director of Strategic Threat and Engagement at Darktrace warned that the Dropbox Sign security breach could extend beyond the impacted users.\n\n\"The implications could extend further into corporate ecosystems: employees reuse passwords all the time for the many apps and tools they log into, so the compromised details may have opened entry points across other cloud services,\" noted Jones.\n\nMeanwhile, Dropbox has hired leading forensic experts to assist in understanding the scope of the eSignature platform's security breach. It has also notified law enforcement and privacy regulatory authorities.\n\nThe company will also contact impacted eSignature users and provide \"step-by-step instructions\" to secure their information.\n\nOther Dropbox services not impacted by security breach\n\nDropbox has not disclosed the number of users impacted by the eSignature security breach. In 2022, the company had 17.37 million paying customers, primarily small and mid-sized businesses, and 700 million registered users.\n\nNevertheless, the cloud storage services provider claims that the security breach was limited to the Dropbox Sign infrastructure, which is separate from other Dropbox services.\n\n\"Additionally, we believe this incident was limited to Dropbox Sign infrastructure and there is no evidence that the threat actor accessed the production environments of other Dropbox products. We are continuing our investigation,\" said the company.\n\nSubsequently, the incident would unlikely have any material impact on the company's financial condition or the results of its operations. However, Dropbox anticipates \"potential litigation, changes in customer behavior, and additional regulatory scrutiny.\"\n\nThe cloud storage services provider also deeply regretted shattering its customers' trust after failing to protect their information.\n\n\"We hold ourselves to a high standard when protecting our customers and their content. We didn't live up to that standard here, and we're deeply sorry for the impact it caused our customers,\" the company apologized.\n\nTwice in two years, Dropbox has become the victim of a cyber attack. In November 2022, the cloud storage provider leaked 130 GitHub source code repositories after it fell victim to a phishing attack.", "source": {"uri": "cpomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CPO Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alicia_hope@cpomagazine.com", "name": "Alicia Hope", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dropbox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OAuth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloud storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data breach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hash function"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-factor authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email address"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Repository (version control)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_hosting_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "File hosting service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GitHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products and Tools", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.cpomagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dropbox-sign-esignature-platforms-security-breach-impacts-all-users-even-those-without-accounts_1500.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554997", "eventUri": "eng-9554997", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

As appropriate, we are also notifying regulatory authorities and users with respect to unauthorized access to personal information.\"\n\nThe hack reportedly exposed data related to users of Dropbox Sign, including their emails and usernames, and general account settings. Dropbox clarified that users that created a Dropbox Sign or HelloSign account but did not set up a password through them (e.g. \"Sign up with Google\") were not exposed.\n\nAdditionally, the company said it found no evidence of unauthorized access to the contents of customer accounts or their payment information.\n\n\"As of the date of this filing, the incident has not had, and we do not believe it is reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our overall business operations, given our current understanding that this incident is limited to the Dropbox Sign infrastructure,\" the company wrote in the filing. \"We have not determined that the incident is reasonably likely to materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.

They should change their passwords and enable MFA immediately.\"\n\nKay attributes the conditions for the hack to their acquisition of HelloSign in 2019.\n\n\"This looks like a classic case of breach through acquisition,\" he said. \"When a large company buys a smaller one, it can throw up major security risks. The most common scenarios are that the acquired company has vulnerabilities, limited security capabilities, or there are compatibility issues as products, technologies, services and teams are integrated.

Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\n\"In Q1, our core business delivered in-line revenue and better than anticipated profitability ,\" said Dropbox Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Drew Houston.\n\nFounded by the long-serving CEO Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi in 2007, Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) provides a file hosting cloud platform that helps organizations collaborate and share documents.\n\nThe catch phrase \"digital transformation\" originally referred to the digitization of documents within enterprises. The growth of digital documents has spurred an explosion of collaboration within and between businesses, which in turn is driving the demand for e-signature and content management platforms.\n\nAs you can see below, Dropbox's revenue growth has been unremarkable over the last three years, growing from $511.6 million in Q1 2021 to $631.3 million this quarter.\n\nDropbox's quarterly revenue was only up 3.3% year on year, which might disappoint some shareholders. On top of that, the company's revenue actually decreased by $3.7 million in Q1 compared to the $2 million increase in Q4 CY2023.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts covering the company were expecting sales to grow 1.6% over the next 12 months before the earnings results announcement.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we've identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nDropbox reported 18.16 million customers at the end of the quarter, an increase of 40,000 from the previous quarter. That's a little better customer growth than last quarter but a bit below what we've typically seen over the last year, suggesting that the company may be reinvigorating growth.\n\nWe were impressed by Dropbox's strong growth in customers this quarter and strong beat on operating profit. We were also glad its gross margin improved. On the other hand, its billings unfortunately missed analysts' expectations. Overall, this quarter's results seemed fairly positive and shareholders should feel optimistic. The stock is up 2.7% after reporting and currently trades at $23.75 per share.\n\nDropbox may have had a good quarter, but does that mean you should invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

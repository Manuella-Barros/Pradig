He also received a diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome and went into full-body paralysis days later.\n\n\"After 8 long days in the Pediatric ICU we are officially HOME!\" Freedie and Chelsea began their Instagram caption. They noted that the three-year-old \"still has a long road ahead of him to regain his strength and relearn how to walk\" but they are grateful that their family is all together once more.\n\n\"Thank you God for this miracle. Also, thank you to our incredible team of doctors and angel nurses for taking such good care of our boy. And to our village for helping so much with Charlie and Brandon,\" the pair added.\n\nAmong the photos featured in the post was one of Chelsea, Freddie and Max in a hospital bed.\n\nA picture of a notebook that had \"prayers for Max\" written on the cover was also shared. Chelsea said in a post on her Instagram Stories that it was gifted to Max from \"our whole Dodgers Family\" and was filled with \"prayers and well wishes.\"\n\nThe Instagram post also included a video of Max being embraced by his brothers, Charlie, 7, and Brandon, 3, back at home.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nLast month, Freddie found out that Max was rushed to the emergency room in pain and was unable to \"sit, stand or walk\" because of it.\n\nThe toddler had \"stopped eating or drinking and was very lethargic,\" according to Chelsea's Instagram Story at the time. He was eventually diagnosed with his health condition, which is caused by the hip joint's lining becoming inflamed.\n\nEarlier this month, Chelsea shared an update about Max's health condition on Instagram, which included his follow-up diagnosis. \"Last Friday, Max rapidly declined and went into full body paralysis. We are very fortunate to have gotten him to the hospital in time so they could reinforce his lungs,\" she began.\n\n\"Freddie was in Houston at the time and rushed to the first flight back home. After many tests, Max is battling a severe case of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. A rare neurological condition that is especially rare in children,\" Chelsea continued.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome occurs when the \"body's immune system attacks the nerves.\" The exact cause isn't known.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nAhead of his ICU release, in an Instagram Stories update from Aug. 3, Chelsea said that his feeding tube came out the day before. \"I am so proud of Max,\" she wrote.\n\n\"The first few days we had so many scary set backs but he has been improving so quickly.

Roberts' update was a positive one after he previously said Friday that the All-Star first baseman would not be joining them for their series against the Oakland Athletics in Oakland.\n\nFreeman has missed the Dodgers' last eight games as he was placed on the family emergency list to be with his son.

He was eventually diagnosed with his health condition, which is caused by the hip joint's lining becoming inflamed.\n\nEarlier this month, Chelsea shared an update about Max's health condition on Instagram, which included his follow-up diagnosis. \"Last Friday, Max rapidly declined and went into full body paralysis. We are very fortunate to have gotten him to the hospital in time so they could reinforce his lungs,\" she began.\n\n\"Freddie was in Houston at the time and rushed to the first flight back home. After many tests, Max is battling a severe case of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. A rare neurological condition that is especially rare in children,\" Chelsea continued.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome occurs when the \"body's immune system attacks the nerves.\" The exact cause isn't known.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nAhead of his ICU release, in an Instagram Stories update from Aug. 3, Chelsea said that his feeding tube came out the day before. \"I am so proud of Max,\" she wrote.\n\n\"The first few days we had so many scary set backs but he has been improving so quickly. I cannot believe it.

And to our village for helping so much with Charlie and Brandon.\"\n\nGuillain-Barre syndrome is a neurological condition in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves, according to the Mayo Clinic.. It can cause weakness, numbness or paralysis, which is what happened with Max Freeman. Though it's a rare condition in children, Guillain-Barre syndrome typically requires treatment in a hospital. And in its most serious form, the condition is a medical emergency.\n\nNo cure for the disease is yet known. However, most people recover completely, even if recovery can take up to several years.

I just don't feel it's right.\"\n\nThe Dodgers have relied on Cavan Biggio at first base during Freeman's time away.\n\nFreeman's wife, Chelsea, provided an update on Max's status and revealed he is battling Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare neurological disorder.\n\n\"Last Friday, Max rapidly declined and went into full body paralysis,\" the Freemans shared in a social media post.\n\nThe statement added there \"is going to be a journey to recover\" but that the family has \"faith that he will be completely healed.\"\n\nThe post also noted tests determined Maximus is battling a \"severe\" case of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, but the family was \"been blown away by his improvements in the last 48 hours.\"\n\nProgress Max has made includes being excavated from a breathing tube and getting taken off a ventilator on Wednesday afternoon. The 3-year-old remains hospitalized.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, the syndrome is \"a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves. It can cause weakness, numbness or paralysis.\"", "source": {"uri": "s22927.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_moreno@s22927.pcdn.co", "name": "Matthew Moreno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan_Biggio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cavan Biggio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventilator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurological disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayo Clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paralysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Genetic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Genetic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Congenital_Anomalies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Congenital Anomalies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://dodgerblue-com.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Freddie-Freeman-10.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790268", "eventUri": "eng-9790268", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The left-handed batter was just named an All-Star for the eighth time in his career, and he's already produced two grand slams this year.\n\nAs for his team, the Dodgers presently hold the top spot in the NL West (65-47). However, they've been going through a slump as of late; the team has only secured four wins in their last 10 games.\n\nFreeman's absence is arguably a reason, and the effects of the injury bug could also play a part. Looking at key pieces, Mookie Betts and Max Muncy are still recovering from their respective injuries. At the mound, Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Walker Buehler are also hurt, putting a dent in the starting rotation.\n\nNevertheless, the Dodgers are now on a two-game winning streak.

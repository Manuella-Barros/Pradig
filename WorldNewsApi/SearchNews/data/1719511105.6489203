{"id": 223733798, "title": "Joao Cancelo faces Man City transfer uncertainty with Barcelona manager decision imminent", "text": "Joao Cancelo, currently on loan at Barcelona from Manchester City, seems likely to face an uncertain future heading into the summer transfer window given the Spanish club's tumultuous appointment of a new manager. Having burnt bridges at his parent club, the Portuguese full-back has so far spent time away from the Etihad Stadium as a loanee to Bayern Munich during City's treble-winning campaign, then to Barcelona throughout this season. As part of Xavi Hernandez's side he has made 41 appearances, registering eight goal contributions. As only a season-long stay, Cancelo would then be in line to return to his parent club, where he still has another three years on his contract. As this appears unlikely given what has happened, exit discussions would need to take place yet again.

This has ultimately led to months of contrasting rumours, the latest of which state that the defender will not be returning to Camp Nou. Spanish publication SPORT claim that with it now confirmed Xavi will not continue at Barca's helm, his expected replacement Hansi Flick is not a fan of Cancelo. The German does not believe he possesses the correct the defensive capabilities to function as part of his system, therefore would rather seek out alternatives in the transfer market. The only hitch in Flick's plan would seem to be the preference for the club itself to use the loan market as opposed to make permanent signings. This is a stark change to the stance just two weeks ago. Xavi had announced his decision to leave his post earlier in the year, but had since been convinced to stay by the board. With trust between the two strong, continuity had practically assured a second loan for Cancelo, but now that avenue would close under Flick with Barca to make the managerial change once the season is complete. Secondly, this marks a huge turnaround in perceptions of Cancelo, who as the most expensive player in his position to date was once regarded at the very top when he acted as a vital cog in Pep Guardiola's title-winning squads of 2020/21 and 2021/22. Lastly, it should mean City will be on the lookout for potential suitors to either organise a third successive loan or better yet recoup as much of the \u00a360m they forked out in 2019.", "summary": "The latest Manchester City transfer news as Spanish media provide clarity on the status of Joao Cancelo heading into the summer window", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/joao-cancelo-faces-man-city-29242941", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29242948.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154009810.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:09:39", "author": "James Quinlan", "authors": ["James Quinlan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.443}

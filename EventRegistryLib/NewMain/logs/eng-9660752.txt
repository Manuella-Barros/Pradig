strengthening the country's internal security.\n\nAustralia has announced a package of initiatives aimed at strengthening Papua New Guinea's internal security and law and justice priorities under a major bilateral security agreement.\n\nA delegation of Australian officials -- including Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong and Minster for International Development Pat Conroy -- are in PNG to attend the 30th Ministerial Forum.\n\nThe measures agreed upon today will be delivered under a long-discussed bilateral pact reached last year while Prime Minister James Marape was visiting Australia.\n\nSenator Wong said the two nations shared inextricable ties.\n\n\"A stronger and safer Papua New Guinea is good for PNG and it is good for Australia,\" she told a press conference.\n\nAustralia will give additional support for stability in the PNG Highlands as part of the agreement, including a new program to help PNG improve weapons management.\n\nIt comes more than a year after one of PNG's worst massacres, which left at least 49 people dead and drew attention to the stacks of illegal firearms and ammunition making their way through the region.\n\nAs well as the weapons management program, Australia will provide support for PNG's legal system to help it investigate and prosecute financial crime and assist with making its correctional facilities safer and more secure.\n\nThe new initiatives also include investments in programs to improve access to justice for young people and remote and regional communities and the supply of 12 armoured LandCruisers to Papua New Guinea's Defence Forces.\n\nUnder a swathe of announcements made on Wednesday, Australian and Papua New Guinean ministers agreed to the opening of an Australian-supported refurbished Air Transport Wing hangar in Port Moresby to accommodate aircraft supplied by Australia.\n\nIt follows the gifting and commissioning of a large police patrol vessel to PNG yesterday -- the largest in the country's fleet -- which will be used to combat trans-border organised crime, particularly in the Torres Strait Region.\n\nPNG's Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchencko said the security cooperation was in both countries' interests.\n\n\"A strong, resilient, safe, prosperous Papua New Guinea will equate to the same in Australia,\" he said during a bilateral meeting with Senator Wong.\n\n\"We look forward to this very important 30th ministerial dialogue between Australia and Papua New Guinea to continue strengthening our relationship, taking our levels higher and higher than they've ever been before.\"\n\nAustralia will also help develop a labour mobility plan to boost PNG's participation in the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme and support PNG's ambition of sending 8,000 workers overseas by 2025.\n\nIn his closing remarks, Mr Marles acknowledged the forum was being held in the shadow of the landslide tragedy in Enga Province last month.\n\nHe said the Australian delegation will travel to the area tomorrow.\n\n\"This meeting has happened with a heavy heart and we stand ready to provide assistance,\" he said.\n\nAustralia's finalisation of the bilateral security agreement with PNG last year came after China signed a police cooperation deal with PNG's neighbour, Solomon Islands.\n\nMininster Tkatchencko yesterday reiterated that his country was not considering similar policing and security offers made by China to PNG.\n\n\"We have chosen not to entertain that at all, made that very, very clear,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to now strengthen our partnership with Australia, who is our traditional partner.\"\n\nIn November, Mr Marape told the ABC his country was caught in a \"confluence of interests\" in the region, but said PNG's relationship with Australia ranked as number one.", "source": {"uri": "home.nzcity.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZCity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Papua New Guinea\u00b4s government has told the United Nations it thinks more than 2,000 people were buried.\n\n\"Road access is critical for essential services as well as food and fuel supply chains,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a written media statement on Thursday which coincided during a visit to the site of the landslide in Mulitaka with PNG Defence Minister Dr Billy Joseph and Enga province's Governor Peter Ipatas.\n\n\"The additional support of $2 million announced today is in response to PNG\u00b4s request to restore connectivity of the Highlands Highway - the transport artery of the region,\" she added.\n\nWong said the financial aid would also support local healthcare services and the provision of more than one thousand learning packs for children.\n\nThursday's announcement builds on Australia\u00b4s initial assistance of $2.5 million for emergency supplies, support for humanitarian partners and the deployment of technical experts including a Disaster Assistance Response Team in the days after the landslide on May 24.\n\n\"Australia and Papua New Guinea are close neighbours, friends and equals,\" Wong said.\n\n\"We stand ready to provide further assistance to the people and Government of Papua New Guinea.\"\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Richard Marles and Wong, with other senior government officials are currently in PNG for a ministerial forum, the most significant such bilateral gathering for Australia amongst the South Pacific island nations.\n\nPNG has a population of nearly 10 million people and is the most populous Pacific Island nation.\n\nDuring the visit, they unveiled a comprehensive aid package aimed at bolstering PNG's internal security and advancing law and justice priorities under a bilateral security agreement established last year as part of Australia's attempts to ward of growing Chinese influence in the region.\n\nKey components of the package involve supporting a weapons management program and enhancing PNG\u00b4s legal framework to combat financial crime.\n\n\"A safe and secure Papua New Guinea is good for Papua New Guinea, it\u00b4s good for Australia and it\u00b4s good for the region,\" Wong said Thursday on Channel Nine's Today show.\n\n\"So, we have an interest, Australians have an interest in making sure we work with Papua New Guinea, our closest neighbour, to ensure security and stability,\" she added.\n\nAlready this year, PNG has been beset by deadly riots in its two largest cities, Port Moresby and Lae, while long-running tribal fueds led to at least 26 men being killed in an ambush in February, as well as a clash between two rival clans that killed eight last month.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

initiatives to improve PNG internal security, law and justice", "body": "Australia has announced a package of initiatives aimed at strengthening Papua New Guinea's internal security and law and justice priorities under a major bilateral security agreement.\n\nA delegation of Australian officials -- including Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, Minister for Foreign Affairs Penny Wong and Minster for International Development Pat Conroy -- are in PNG to attend the 30th Ministerial Forum.\n\nThe measures agreed upon today will be delivered under a long-discussed bilateral pact reached last year while Prime Minister James Marape was visiting Australia.\n\nSenator Wong said the two nations shared inextricable ties.\n\n\"A stronger and safer Papua New Guinea is good for PNG and it is good for Australia,\" she told a press conference.\n\nAustralia will give additional support for stability in the PNG Highlands as part of the agreement, including a new program to help PNG improve weapons management.\n\nIt comes more than a year after one of PNG's worst massacres, which left at least 49 people dead and drew attention to the stacks of illegal firearms and ammunition making their way through the region.\n\nAs well as the weapons management program, Australia will provide support for PNG's legal system to help it investigate and prosecute financial crime and assist with making its correctional facilities safer and more secure.\n\nThe new initiatives also include investments in programs to improve access to justice for young people and remote and regional communities and the supply of 12 armoured LandCruisers to Papua New Guinea's Defence Forces.\n\nUnder a swathe of announcements made on Wednesday, Australian and Papua New Guinean ministers agreed to the opening of an Australian-supported refurbished Air Transport Wing hangar in Port Moresby to accommodate aircraft supplied by Australia.\n\nIt follows the gifting and commissioning of a large police patrol vessel to PNG yesterday -- the largest in the country's fleet -- which will be used to combat trans-border organised crime, particularly in the Torres Strait Region.\n\nPNG's Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchencko said the security cooperation was in both countries' interests.\n\n\"We look forward to this very important 30th ministerial dialogue between Australia and Papua New Guinea to continue strengthening our relationship, taking our levels higher and higher than they've ever been before.\"\n\nAustralia will also help develop a labour mobility plan to boost PNG's participation in the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme and support PNG's ambition of sending 8,000 workers overseas by 2025.\n\nAustralia's finalisation of the bilateral security agreement with PNG last year came after China signed a police cooperation deal with PNG's neighbour, Solomon Islands.\n\nMininster Tkatchencko yesterday reiterated that his country was not considering similar policing and security offers made by China to PNG.\n\n\"We have chosen not to entertain that at all, made that very, very clear,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to now strengthen our partnership with Australia, who is our traditional partner.\"\n\nIn November, Mr Marape told the ABC his country was caught in a \"confluence of interests\" in the region, but said PNG's relationship with Australia ranked as number one.", "source":

Papua New Guinea's government has told the United Nations it thinks more than 2,000 people were buried when the mountainside tumbled onto the settlement of Yambali as people slept.\n\n\"Road access is critical for essential services as well as food and fuel supply chains,\" Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said in a statement that coincided with a visit to the site of the landslide with Papua New Guinea's Defense Minister Billy Joseph and Enga Gov. Peter Ipatas.\n\n\"The additional support of $2 million announced today is in response to PNG's request to restore connectivity of the Highlands Highway - the transport artery of the region,\" Wong added.\n\nWong said the aid would also support local health care services and the provision of more than 1,000 learning packs for children.\n\nAustralia's initial assistance of $2.5 million provided emergency supplies, support for humanitarian partners and disaster responders and technical experts in the days after the landslide on May 24.\n\nPNG security supportFeatured Local Savings\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Richard Marles and Wong, with other senior government officials are in Papua New Guinea for a ministerial forum, the most significant such bilateral gathering for Australia among South Pacific island nations.\n\nPNG has a population of nearly 10 million people and is the most populous Pacific island nation.\n\nDuring the visit, they unveiled a comprehensive aid package aimed at bolstering Papua New Guinea's internal security and advancing law and justice priorities under a bilateral security agreement established last year as part of Australia's attempts to ward of growing Chinese influence in the region.\n\nKey components of the package involve supporting a weapons management program and enhancing PNG's legal framework to combat financial crime.\n\n\"A safe and secure Papua New Guinea is good for Papua New Guinea, it's good for Australia and it's good for the region,\" Wong said Thursday on Channel Nine's Today show.\n\n\"So, we have an interest, Australians have an interest in making sure we work with Papua New Guinea, our closest neighbor, to ensure security and stability,\" she added.\n\nAlready this year, PNG has been beset by deadly riots in its two largest cities, Port Moresby and Lae, while long-running tribal feuds led to at least 26 men being killed in an ambush in February, as well as a clash between two rival clans that killed eight last month.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gazette.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

under a significant bilateral security agreement.\n\nA delegation of Australian officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, Foreign Minister Penny Wong and International Development Minister Pat Conroy is currently in PNG to participate in the 30th Ministerial Forum.\n\n\"This is the only country with whom we have this type of ministerial engagement and it reflects who we are to one another,\" Wong said at a news conference.\n\nAustralia will provide additional support to enhance stability in PNG Highlands as part of the agreement, including a new program to assist the country in improving weapons management.\n\nThe initiative follows a period of heightened concern about illegal firearms and ammunition in the region, exacerbated by one of PNG's deadliest massacres more than a year ago, which resulted in at least 49 fatalities.\n\n\"A stronger and safer Papua New Guinea is good for PNG and it is good for Australia,\" Wong added.\n\nAustralia will also provide support for PNG's legal system to help it investigate and prosecute financial crime and assist with making correctional facilities safer and more secure.\n\nThe initiatives include investments in programs to improve access to justice for young people and remote and regional communities, and the supply of 12 armored Land Cruisers to PNG's defense forces.", "source": {"uri": "yenisafak.com",

The mine employs about 2,000 local workers.\n\nIt remains unclear how many people died in the landslide on May 24, with the national government and a U.N. estimate putting the death toll at about 670.\n\nAustralia's Foreign Minister, Penny Wong, said in an ABC interview on Thursday that Australia was \"in a permanent contest in the Pacific\", referring to its rivalry with China for security ties, and wanted to ensure stability in PNG.\n\n($1 = 1.4984 Australian dollars)\n\nReporting by Kirsty Needham in Sydney; additional reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne.

Several of Australia's most senior government ministers have travelled to our closest neighbour to meet with their counterparts, with concerns over China's growing influence in the region front of mind following Beijing's attempt to woo the strategically-placed country. For more let's cross live now to our Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who is in Port Moresby. Morning to you, thanks so much for being with us. So given the new security initiatives that you announced \u2011\u2011\n\nPenny Wong, Foreign Minister: Good morning, good to be with you.\n\nWright: Thank you. Can we count on PNG do you think to be on our side if there is a dispute in the South Pacific?\n\nForeign Minister: Look, we're here as a ministerial delegation with, you know, our closest neighbour, a country that has fought with us, a country, you know, who became independent as a result of the actions of Australia alongside Papua New Guinea. So we have a long\u2011standing history, a very close relationship and that's reflected in the forum that we have had.\n\nOf course, what I've said already is, you know, we're in a permanent contest in the Pacific and so what that means is Australia has to continue to step up, we have to continue to be a more engaged, more involved partner in the Pacific.\n\nWright: Yeah, okay. Let's talk about these interesting comments yesterday from your counterpart from PNG, that the Foreign Minister there, hoping to send more temporary workers to Australia, but the Foreign Minister said that we have to make sure that Australia doesn't get any of their riff\u2011raff problems. How do we ensure that?\n\nForeign Minister: Well, we know that, you know, workers coming to Australia from Papua New Guinea and from other countries in the Pacific is good for us. You know, a lot of those workers do things such as fruit picking, very important for the Australian economy, particularly the agricultural sector. But we want to make sure that, you know, it's sustainable. We want to make sure that those workers are supported and that they have the skills that employers need. I think what Justin Tkatchenko was saying is that we want to make sure that, Papua New Guinea wants to make sure that the workers that they give us reflect the sorts of needs of the Australian industry.\n\nWright: Yeah, okay. There's been plenty of discussion following Australian journalist Cheng Lei's treatment by Chinese officials during the Chinese Premier's recent visit here in Australia. Have we received any kind of apology from Beijing? Because Cheng Lei also says she was blocked from another press event, this time between Peter Dutton and China's Premier? If that is the case this is an outrageous situation.\n\nForeign Minister: Well, I think let's be very clear. What we say is, you know, we believe in freedom of the press. I've spoken to Cheng Lei. I've made clear to her, as has the Prime Minister publicly, you know, she has our support and that's why the Prime Minister raised this matter directly with Premier Li personally before he left. You know, obviously freedom of the press matters in Australia and we're very supportive of Cheng Lei. As you know we worked very hard to support her and we're so pleased that she was able to come back home to Australia to be with her kids.\n\nWright: Yes, which is wonderful, but this is how she was treated by Chinese officials. We're looking at vision right now inside the Parliament House, our Parliament House. And then yesterday she says she that she was pre\u2011approved to be at this event and then was blocked from attending. I mean viewers are quite rightly absolutely outraged by this.\n\nForeign Minister: And freedom of the press matters and certainly I haven't seen the second event, but I certainly saw the footage of the first event at Parliament House and that was the wrong thing to do. That should not have happened. We were very pleased that she could attend the press conference but concerned about what has occurred, so it is a good thing the Prime Minister has raised this directly with Premier Li.\n\nWright: Yeah, all right. Foreign Minister Penny Wong, we really appreciate your time this morning from PNG.

I would like to extend my warm thanks to everyone in attendance for today's event.\n\nCommissioning of the PPV Minigulai\n\nIn December last year I had the great pleasure of meeting with Prime Minister Marape, Mr Tkatchenko and Mr Tsiamalili in Canberra following the signing of the historic Bilateral Security Agreement. And it was great to see Prime Minister Marape again in February this year in Canberra where we were honoured to have him address the Australian Parliament - the first leader of a Pacific island nation to do so.\n\nIt is an honour for me to meet with you again today in your beautiful country. And it is my great pleasure to be here to present the Police Patrol Vessel Minigulai to the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, on behalf of the Australian Federal Police.\n\nPapua New Guinea is Australia's closest neighbour and our deeply respected friend, and today we have the opportunity to celebrate the long partnership between our independent and democratic nations.\n\nIn 1973, the then Prime Minister of Australia and great supporter of independence - Gough Whitlam - affirmed to the Papua New Guinea Government:\n\nIn Australia you have an assured friend and I believe we shall forge a true partnership to the great advantage of both our countries and for the welfare of both our peoples.\n\nThese words were, in fact, a prophecy.\n\nThese words foretold the links, strong and true, between our nations. Links that grow in strength, and in diversity, by the day.\n\nPrime Minister Whitlam, and your revered first Prime Minister and father of the nation, Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare - these great men lived those words.\n\nThey showed us the benefit of working together - steadfastly - towards a common goal and the common interests of our nations.\n\nThe links that we share, and our nations' steadfast friendship, are embodied today in our work to strengthen our economies, and forge greater opportunities for our peoples.\n\nIn our shared experience as vast countries rich in national resources - and rich in challenging and rugged terrain.\n\nIn our desire to share our cultural heritage with each other. In our peoples' love of sport.\n\nAnd in our efforts to mutually support the security of our countries, and our region.\n\nOur links, our friendship, and our steadfast work together are embodied in the Bilateral Security Agreement signed by our Prime Ministers last year.\n\nPrime Ministers who themselves, if I may say, Prime Minister Marape - carry on the tradition of genuine friendship and deep respect between our countries.\n\nThrough the Bilateral Security Agreement, Australia and Papua New Guinea committed to deepening our security cooperation right across the spectrum, from traditional areas such as policing and national security, right through to climate change, cyber security, gender-based violence and critical infrastructure.\n\nThis agreement represents an enhanced enduring partnership that equips us to tackle new and emerging security challenges.\n\nMost relevantly for us here today, through the Bilateral Security Agreement we committed to deepening our ties and our work together in policing.\n\nThe commissioning of PPV Minigulai is another milestone in the long relationship between Australia and Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe commissioning of this vessel - with the support of both the AFP and Tasmania Police - highlights the enduring collaboration between our law enforcement agencies to combat transnational and organised crime.\n\nThis commissioning further demonstrates Australia's commitment to assisting the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary to address transnational crime, and to support joint cross-border operations. through the expanded Papua New Guinea - Australia Policing Partnership.\n\nThe AFP's partnership with the RPNGC is its largest bilateral partnership across the globe.\n\nThis is a clear demonstration of the strength of our ties, and the depth of our work together - in policing as in so many areas across government and our nations.\n\nRPNGC Officer Cadet Program\n\nThe Australian Federal Police, the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary and Queensland Police Service recently launched a groundbreaking training program for RPNGC Police Officer Cadets.\n\nOver the next four months, more than 60 RPNGC cadets will travel to Australia to undertake training with the Queensland Police Service and attend the Australian Institute of Police Management where they will have the opportunity to develop their leadership capabilities.\n\nThese cadets are the future leaders of the RPNGC and it is fantastic to be able to give them the opportunity to travel to Australia and experience our diverse operational environment.\n\nLess than lethal use of force capability uplift\n\nThe AFP, through the PNG-Australia Policing Partnership Program, has commenced provision of less than lethal use of force training and provision of less than lethal munitions and equipment to the RPNGC.\n\nThis program under the Bilateral Security Agreement addresses a capability gap for the RPNGC when responding to incidents such as civil disorder or armed offenders, ensures the RPNGC uses commensurate force when resolving civil disorder incidents.\n\nThe training has been delivered to the RPNGC Sector Patrols in Port Moresby, is now being delivered in Lae, and will roll out to other Provincial centres such as Mt Hagen and Kokopo in the near future.\n\nThis is the first time the AFP has delivered this training and provided less than lethal use of force capabilities to the RPNGC.\n\nProvision of police housing to RPNGC\n\nThe AFP has agreed to support the RPNGC with the construction of police housing across priority provinces commencing with the construction of police barracks-styled accommodation in Port Moresby, Kokopo and Mount Hagen as the first phase of the initiative.\n\nThis will allow RPNGC recruits to be placed in regional centres upon graduation.\n\nThere will be ongoing consultation and prioritisation with the RPNGC as the AFP construct and deliver more housing over the coming years.\n\nBomana Police Training College\n\nI am pleased that Australia - through the AFP - is continuing to invest in the Bomana Police Training College, which I look forward to visiting later today.\n\nI thank Papua New Guinea - and the RPNGC - for offering to open the Training College to other Pacific police forces.\n\nThis is a further example of how Papua New Guinea and Australia will continue to support the development of regional policing.\n\nAustralia is investing in police barracks and housing across the country, to support your recruits and officers in their challenging and valuable work.\n\nI am proud that working together, the RPNGC, the AFP and our Pacific partners in the Solomons International Assistance Force, supported our friends in the Solomon Islands to deliver a wonderful Pacific Games in 2023, and smooth joint elections in 2024.\n\nAs the Attorney-General and First Law Officer of Australia I am also pleased that Australia is working with Papua New Guinea to support the broader system of law and justice.\n\nEffective legal frameworks are critical to the ultimate success of the work of law enforcement.\n\nEffective laws, effective prosecutions, and courts that can progress matters in a swift and orderly fashion - supporting your hard work deterring, detecting and investigating criminal activity.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs my remarks draw to a close today, I would like to echo the words of the Australian Prime Minister on the historic occasion of Prime Minister Marape's address to the Australian Parliament in February this year:\n\nAustralians will never forget what the people of Papua New Guinea did for us in the past. Let us never doubt what we can achieve together in our future.\n\nI look forward to the PPV Minigulai supporting the RPNGC's hard work protecting the safety and security of Papua New Guinea, and of our region.\n\nAs the Attorney-General of Australia, I look forward to continuing to work with you - as those who came before us did - to support the peace, prosperity and resilience of our countries and across our region.\n\nThank you.\n\n/Public Release.

Among them is Foreign Minister, Penny Wong, who joins us now from Enga Province. Good morning to you, Foreign Minister, great to see you.\n\nPenny Wong, Foreign Minister: Good to be with you.\n\nBridget Brennan: Just tell us about the purpose of this visit of this very high\u2011level delegation, I believe it's one of the largest delegations you've taken to PNG. What's the purpose of this trip?\n\nForeign Minister: Well, Papua New Guinea is the only country where we have this type of engagement, multiple ministers sitting down with their counterparts in this ministerial forum, and as you said in the introduction, this is one of the most senior delegations Australia has ever sent, with a number of cabinet ministers and ministers who work in areas that are relevant to the Pacific.\n\nSo, it's very important, because this is our closest neighbour, we have a long\u2011standing history with Papua New Guinea, and Papua New Guinea's stability and security is good for Australia, it's good for Papua New Guinea, and it's also good for the region.\n\nBridget Brennan: Last year, the Prime Minister, James Marape said that PNG was caught in a confluence of interest in the region, and we know there are competing interests and competing demands for attention in the Pacific. How is Australia faring in terms of our relationship with PNG given China's influence in the region?\n\nForeign Minister: Look, I said a few days ago that we are in a state of permanent contest in the Pacific, and I meant it. The, you know, ability to be, or the opportunity to be the only partner of choice was lost under Peter Dutton and the Liberals. We are now in a permanent contest, and what we have to do to assure Australia's interests is to keep engaging with Papua New Guinea and other members of the Pacific Islands Forum, to keep ensuring we work with them to assure their security needs, because our view, as is the view of the leaders of the Pacific is that if security is provided within the Pacific family, on that path is security and stability for all.\n\nBridget Brennan: We saw a devastating toll from that landslide a few weeks ago, and I know Australia offered a lot of support after that event. Will you be able to speak to communities affected and have a look at some of the aid that's gone in that region?\n\nForeign Minister: Look, I hope so. We are going to Enga Province today, which is where this, you know, horrific landslide occurred. As you said, we offered support immediately, we provided an initial $2.5 million in humanitarian assistance, we've sent a team in to assess damage and to give the advice to the Papua New Guinean Government about the extent of the damage and risk and what more needs to be done.\n\nBut there is a lot of rebuilding, potentially relocation, which will have to occur, and what I said to Prime Minister Marape last night at dinner is that we will work with them on working out how we provide the solutions and the assistance to the people of this province and this village.\n\nOur condolences go to all those who have lost someone, and there have been many people who have been grieving for weeks now.\n\nBridget Brennan: Penny Wong, Peter Dutton said his plan towards nuclear energy in Australia is a pragmatic solution to keep the lights on. What's your assessment?\n\nForeign Minister: It's a risky and expensive gamble that won't work. I mean that's the reality. I mean this is decades of subsidy from Australians on, you know, infrastructure and technology we don't have in order to deliver higher electricity prices.\n\nYou know, we've seen what happens when the Coalition, you know, does this. They are so allergic to renewables. We saw under them power exit the system because they gave the private sector no certainty, no one was investing in energy, and now he wants to delay for decades and ensure that taxpayers stump up the money to build these plants. It's just risky, expensive, and it won't work.\n\nBridget Brennan: Peter Dutton points to countries like France. I believe France is using about 70 per cent of its energy mix from nuclear alongside renewables. He says that's an example for Australia to move towards our commitment to meet those 2050 targets. What do you make of that?\n\nForeign Minister: Well, I'd say to him that France has had nuclear energy for a very, very long time. The problem we have here is \u2011 and this is \u2011 I know this has been an obsession of the Coalition for decades, John Howard commissioned a study to look at nuclear power, and it was found to be, you know, many, many decades of subsidy from taxpayers before you'd actually get anything, and even then it would be the most expensive form of power, leaving aside all of the risks that people are concerned about. So yet again we see Peter Dutton putting up something that is not going to help Australian households which won't deliver power in any timeframe that matters and will deliver more expensive power after people have had to subsidise it for decades. So I just think this really is no plan, worse than no plan actually, it's a risky gamble from Peter Dutton.\n\nBridget Brennan: Let's go to Gaza where the UN has reconfirmed it is the most dangerous place in the world to be an aid worker; hundreds of thousands of people facing famine conditions. Do you continue to have a dialogue with the Israeli Government about your concerns about the way in which this conflict is being carried out?\n\nForeign Minister: We've been very clear about our position, whether it's in our engagement with Israel, whether it's in our voting position in the United Nations, whether it's in my public statements or the Prime Minister's public statements, we've been very clear, and what we \u2011 what I say is this: President Biden has put out a ceasefire plan, but all parties should agree to it, we should have a ceasefire, hostages should be released, aid should flow and civilians should be protected. The cost of this conflict has been catastrophic, and what is occurring in Gaza is horrific, and we have to find a pathway out. The American President has put on the table a pathway out, and all parties should back it in.\n\nBridget Brennan: Thanks very much, Penny Wong, for your time this morning. I wouldn't mind a bit of your weather this morning. Pretty freezing here in Melbourne. Have a good trip.\n\nForeign Minister: It's pretty warm here, yeah, it's not \u2011 we're looking forward to getting back to Australia, but it's going to be chilly. Thanks very much.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi

Do you continue to have a dialogue with the Israeli Government about your concerns about the way in which this conflict is being carried out?\n\nForeign Minister: We've been very clear about our position, whether it's in our engagement with Israel, whether it's in our voting position in the United Nations, whether it's in my public statements or the Prime Minister's public statements, we've been very clear, and what we \u2011 what I say is this: President Biden has put out a ceasefire plan, but all parties should agree to it, we should have a ceasefire, hostages should be released, aid should flow and civilians should be protected. The cost of this conflict has been catastrophic, and what is occurring in Gaza is horrific, and we have to find a pathway out. The American President has put on the table a pathway out, and all parties should back it in.\n\nBridget Brennan: Thanks very much, Penny Wong, for your time this morning. I wouldn't mind a bit of your weather this morning. Pretty freezing here in Melbourne. Have a good trip.\n\nForeign Minister: It's pretty warm here, yeah, it's not \u2011 we're looking forward to getting back to Australia, but it's going to be chilly. Thanks very much.\n\n/Public Release. This material from the originating organization/author(s) might be of the point-in-time nature, and edited for clarity, style and length.

They have been cringing under the big red pebble in the desert for some time now, figuring out ways to counter the red dragon as it eyes their domain in the Pacific and maybe even the Southern Ocean.\n\nIt is palpable in the way they behave. Behind the calm and stoicism of Senator Penny Wong is a mask of fear. One has to feel for her. She is the 'nambawan' diplomatic foot soldier of Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\n\nTrusted, unwavering, fearless, intelligent, and warm but firm. and Albo is fortunate to have the Iron Lady from Down Under as his globetrotting Foreign Minister.\n\nThis week in Moresby, she hung out a sign that reads in PNG's Tok Pisin 'Yumi Stap Wantaim' which loosely translates as 'We are Together' or 'We Stay Together'.\n\nIt might placate a few but most hardline PNG politicians like Trade Minister Richard Maru have a dim view of staying with Australia especially when trade agreements with PNG are lopsided towards Australia's favour.\n\nThis is where the Yumi Stap Wantaim signage is delusional, and made more intense by PNG's cynicism toward its former political master. Many senior politicians won't say it but it is well known that many question trade imbalance, boomerang aid, and even Australia's discriminatory travel bans on Papua New Guineans.\n\nPNG's Pangu Pati, which wrestled independence from Australia in 1975 has always preached Friends to all, Enemies to none in its search for trade partners far and wide.\n\nThis openness and leaning towards China's Road and Belt highway are of no comfort to those who chart the course of Australia in the Pacific turf and seaweed war.\n\nSo the mood this week in the Australian PNG Ministerial Forum in Port Moresby has been quite frankly of a voracious fear factor masked by larrikin Aussie banter.\n\nThe leaders are there but their thoughts are not on the same level. Australia needs to up its game.\n\nBesides trying to progress development issues both political, social, cultural, economic between both countries including donating police boats, promises of police houses, to massive aid for humanitarian relief in Mulitaka, an NRL team for PNG, the Marape government's stance on continuing to court China does not seem to have softened.\n\nThe PNG Government abides by its local 'wantok' system. You scratch my back, I scratch your back. Chinas been doing a lot of scratching and those in Canberra with antennas aloft have been worried.\n\nPNG is simply following its stated mantra of Friends to All. The last time a chinaman played scratch lotto in Port Moresby in April, Albo was busy scratching Marape's back on the Kokoda Track, reminding Marape that Kokoda is hallowed turf and no chinaman died there defending PNG and Australia.\n\nIts time Wong changed tactics, she needs to put her tiger on the hill. It's time to be forthright with Papua New Guinea politicians. Call them out Penny.\n\nYou know, we know, the country knows, the world knows, it's not the Chinese, it's the PNG politicians themselves who need to be told that 'hey you cannot hold your country to ransom'.\n\nWong and team need to play hardball with PNG. Wong knows that it is corruption at the highest levels that is the real threat to PNG and Australia. PNG does not progress because corruption is no longer an eight-legged fish.\n\nIt has grown to 118 legs. That is the key problem. We cannot live together with that level of poison.", "source": {"uri": "postcourier.com.pg", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Seven Australian ministers and the country's police chief are in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to hold security and trade talks amid competition with China for policing ties in the Pacific Islands, and to underscore Australian humanitarian assistance after the disaster last month.\n\n\"It was moving to see so many people in such a dire situation,\" Australia's Minister for Pacific, Pat Conroy, said in an ABC Television interview, after visiting the site with PNG Defence Minister Billy Joseph and the delegation. Australia will provide assistance for health clinics, and education packs for thousands of survivors who must move from villages where mountainsides collapsed.\n\nPNG had requested A$2 million to \"start the work to open up the national highway there to the Porgera gold mine, which is obviously an incredibly important source of jobs and revenue for the people of Enga province\", Conroy said. The Porgera mine, about 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the landslide, is an underground mine jointly run by Canada's Barrick Gold (ABX.TO) and China's Zijin Mining Group (601899.SS), with the Papua New Guinea government holding a 51% share.\n\nThe mine was re-started this year after being in dispute for four years as PNG sought to boost returns to tribal landowners, and had been expected to reach full production this year. Barrick did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPNG Prime Minister James Marape said in April the reopened mine was expected to return to its status as one of the world's largest gold mines, becoming a significant contributor to the national treasury and generating income for Enga province. The mine employs about 2,000 local workers. It remains unclear how many people died in the landslide on May 24, with the national government and a U.N. estimate putting the death toll at about 670.\n\nAustralia's Foreign Minister, Penny Wong, said in an ABC interview on Thursday that Australia was \"in a permanent contest in the Pacific\", referring to its rivalry with China for security ties, and wanted to ensure stability in PNG.

China will continue to assert its interests,\" she said. \"How we deal with that is to assert ours and we do so both in the bilateral relationship but also in the way we engage in the region and the way we engage with other powers.\"\n\nMeg Keen, director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based research organization, told VOA that both Canberra and Washington want to limit Beijing's influence in Papua New Guinea.\n\nChina has already sent police to neighboring Solomon Islands and Kiribati, insisting it has a plan to help Pacific Island countries maintain social order.\n\nAustralia has, however, said that Beijing should have \"no role\" in policing the Pacific Islands, and that the Canberra government will train more local security forces to fill gaps.\n\nKeen said China has strategic ambitions in the Pacific region.\n\n\"China is in a competition with Taiwan for recognition and since 2019 it has been able to win the support away from Taiwan of three countries in the region. That is significant. Kiribati is one of those,\" Keen said. \"So, while these are small countries they have enormous ocean territories. They sit in a very strategic place between the United States, Australia and Asia.\"\n\nThis week, the Chinese Premier Li Qiang held talks with senior government officials in Australia.\n\nIt was a further sign that bilateral relations, which have been strained over various geopolitical and trade disputes, are improving.\n\nHowever, differences between the two sides remain over human rights, the South China Sea, allegations of cyber espionage and, increasingly, over Beijing's ambitions in the Pacific, a region Australia has traditionally considered to be its sphere of influence.", "source":

PNG welcomed Australia's ongoing support for PNG's electoral reform priorities, as recommended by the Special Parliamentary Committee on the 2022 National General Election and endorsed by the PNG Parliament.Ministers recognised that because their security interests are shared including by virtue of geographic proximity, decisions taken by one country affect the security of the other.

CSEP Pillar 3 - Economic Partnership for ProsperityMinisters welcomed the progress to ensure a mutually beneficial Australia-PNG Economic Partnership, following Leaders' commitment to explore ways to boost economic growth and resilience, business ties, trade and investment.

Reflecting the significant role of business and industry, and the importance of Australia's AUD26 billion worth of investments in PNG (2023), Ministers encouraged the business communities to consider the opportunities that PNG offered, including in downstream processing of agriculture, fisheries and forestry products, and the green economy. Consistent with the agreement in 2011, Ministers agreed senior officials and senior business representatives from both countries would meet ahead of the next Australia-PNG Business Dialogue to discuss and advise on opportunities and challenges in the business relationship.PNG welcomed Australia's support for its priorities around the 13 year Budget Repair Plan. Ministers noted Australia's cumulative budget loan support since the pandemic of over AUD2.5 billion, or PGK6.2 billion, linked to PNG's own economic reform agenda. PNG is expected to repay PGK510 million in interest and principal of this vital budget support in 2024. With the declining need for budget support due to budget repair, Ministers agreed to examine if there were other ways of supporting PNG's fiscal reform efforts. Ministers welcomed PNG's ongoing commitment to its IMF Extended Credit Facility and Extended Fund Facility Program, noting that PNG's commitments on debt sustainability through this program are important when considering the large pipeline of infrastructure financing proposals.Ministers welcomed ongoing cooperation on critical infrastructure investments including AUD200m of infrastructure delivered this year, and Australia's commitment to over AUD2\u202fbillion of infrastructure investment delivered through the PNG-Australia Economic Partnership (transport, telecommunications, electrification, social infrastructure and State-Owned Enterprise reform) and the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility (ports, energy, telecommunication and roads). The AIFFP pipeline includes approximately AUD1 billion in grants and loans to support major capital projects in ports (AUD621 million), roads (AUD76 million) and electrification (AUD306 million) across PNG.

Ministers also agreed to cooperate to strengthen PNG's public procurement processes, particularly in tendering.Ministers highlighted progress on agricultural cooperation and recognised strong biosecurity systems and protocols as an essential prerequisite for boosting agricultural trade. PNG welcomed Australia's commitment to a biosecurity twinning program between Australia's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and PNG's National Agriculture Quarantine Inspection Agency (NAQIA) and support for the construction of a PCR laboratory at NAQIA to enhance biosecurity testing. Ministers recognised the importance of effective domestic and international agricultural supply chains in supporting food security and creating export opportunities.Ministers welcomed the achievement of all visa-related commitments made at the 29th Ministerial Forum. PNG welcomed Australia's processing of at least 75 per cent of completed Papua New Guinean visitor visa applications within 14 days. PNG welcomed Australia's establishment of the new Pacific Service Centre including the re-establishment of a visa processing capability in PNG with resources to facilitate and expedite visa processing and the improved and streamlined biometrics collection processes and arrangements.

Ministers noted the importance of expanding opportunities for Papua New Guineans to enter the Australian labour market. Ministers agreed to cooperate to ensure integrity and minimise fraud or other compromises of their visa systems.Ministers committed to growing and strengthening PNG's participation in the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme, recognising the benefits for the PNG economy and communities and Australian employers.

The Ministerial forum comes at a critical time, with Australia hoping to maintain its position as a dominant trade and security partner in the Pacific. Foreign Minister Penny Wong is the co-chair of the forum. She joins me now on her way out of Australia. Minister, welcome to you.\n\nPenny Wong, Foreign Minister: Good evening. Good to speak with you. I'm about to head off.\n\nAndy Park: Okay, let me know if they put the seatbelt sign on. You're about to fly to the Pacific, where there are really competing interests escalating and the Chinese Premier is in Australia. This is not ideal timing, you might say?\n\nMinister Wong: Well, I think this is a very good time to go to Papua New Guinea for the Ministerial forum. I'm very pleased to be doing that. And also it was a very important visit that we see and saw by the Chinese Premier, the first visit in seven years. But tonight I'll be flying to Papua New Guinea, be joined by six of my colleagues. It's a very senior Ministerial representation. We haven't seen this, certainly under the Coalition Government, and that's because we understand that Australia's stability and security requires our deep engagement in the Pacific with other pacific nations. And Papua New Guinea is just so important to Australia.\n\nAndy Park: Just want to talk a bit more about the Chinese delegation's visit to Australia. I mean, how would you characterise this trip? Are you confident that Australia's interests have been at the forefront as relations get back on track?\n\nMinister Wong: Well, Australia's interests are always at the forefront for us and obviously China's interests are what they seek to press. I mean, that is the nature of international relations, the nature of diplomacy. As I've said previously, we don't expect China to stop being China. China will continue to assert its interests. How we deal with that is to assert ours and we do so both in the bilateral relationship, but also in the way we engage in the region and the way we engage with other powers. So, I think it's been very good to see impediments on trade removed. Obviously, we took the opportunity to raise some of the difficult issues in the relationship and the Prime Minister today has done that as well.\n\nAndy Park: Such as the case of the jailed Australian academic Yang Hengjun. What assurances was Australia given in this case? What assurances did the Chinese Premier give our Prime Minister?\n\nMinister Wong: Well, as you know, we have raised both publicly and privately Dr Yang's sentence. I have said very clearly our response to his suspended death sentence. We have pressed for his appropriate treatment and appropriate medical treatment. And the Prime Minister raised Dr Yang with the Premier, as did I. I'm obviously not going to go into all the details. We will continue to press for him to get appropriate medical treatment. And we will continue to press for his return to his family, just as we did with Cheng Lei.\n\nAndy Park: Minister, the Prime Minister has said that one of the practical measures addressed yesterday morning was improving military to military communication to avoid conflicts. I mean, there really have been some dangerous and unfortunate encounters, like in the airspace over the Yellow Sea. How is this issue ironed out? Is it the military speaking to each other? Is it having a red phone? I don't know. How is it simple enough for us to understand what's at stake and how to improve it?\n\nMinister Wong: Well first, Australia's position is very clear. We will continue to fly and sail in international airspace and international waters. I've made that clear publicly and I've made that clear to my counterparts. Secondly, we expect all countries to observe the international rules and norms that govern behaviour in those airspaces and on international waters. Third, for the last two years, one of the things I've been speaking about is the importance of dialogue and engagement, particularly in the context of increasing military activities. And one of the things we have to try and avoid is escalation or miscalculation. We also want to ensure we don't see unsafe or unprofessional interactions. So, it is a useful thing, an important step, to have military to military engagement. That is one of the ways you can deescalate and avoid there being a miscalculation or a mistake, but also as a matter of principle, Australia's position is very clear. We observe international law. We expect all militaries to behave professionally. We will continue to fly and sail in international waters and airspace.\n\nAndy Park: Speaking of potentially unprofessional interactions, the Chinese official looking to block Sky News journalist Cheng Lei and the view of her at the press conference yesterday, the Opposition Leader, Peter Dutton, has criticised Anthony Albanese for, quote, 'not standing up for our country', in terms of his response to that event. The Government has complained to the Chinese Embassy. Should it have gone further?\n\nMinister Wong: Well the fact is Prime Minister Albanese raised this matter with the Chinese Premier Li directly this morning. And that demonstrates why engagement is important. We are going to have things on which we disagree, on things in which we disagree very deeply because of who we are. And freedom of the press is very important to Australia. So, the Prime Minister has raised the matter with the Chinese Premier and I have to say the Prime Minister and I understand the importance of standing up for Cheng Lei, that's why we worked for two years to secure her return home. So, you know, Australia has tried it Mr Dutton's way. You know, it got us nowhere. We know that Mr Dutton's focus is always on what is a domestic political fight, not actually on getting outcomes for Australians. That's what we're focused on.\n\nAndy Park: Minister, this visit to Papua New Guinea, you'll be co-chairing the Ministerial forum, the Defence Minister, the AG will also be there, Agriculture Minister Murray Watt and Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil. What are you hoping to achieve in this visit?\n\nMinister Wong: Well, the Ministerial forum is a really important opportunity to make sure we continue building the relationship, that we look at what we've previously agreed, how that's being implemented and where we can go further. And obviously, whether that's in terms of people to people links, the economic engagement, the security engagement, in terms of agriculture, trade, all of these things. What we will be doing is working through a whole range of the dimensions of our relationship and see what more we can do. So, I'm really pleased that so many of my colleagues are coming with me and with the Deputy Prime Minister.

The separate agreements between PNG and two rival partners, Australia and China, will have some superficial upsides for all parties. But the devil in the details of each arrangement lays bare the stark reality that both countries are getting it wrong, and that all three will likely suffer the consequences.\n\nIn April, during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's high level visit to Papua New Guinea, the two sides sealed new deals improving PNG's access to China's market. In particular, two separate agreements will allow direct exports of PNG's unroasted coffee and cocoa beans to mainland China. Both governments also pledged to push forward negotiations on a broader free trade agreement.\n\nCalling the agreements \"a huge success,\" PNG's Foreign Affairs Minister Justin Tkatchenko boasted that the deals will benefit \"over 80 percent of our people that live off the land and [allow] the farmers to become self-reliant.\"\n\nThe geopolitical underpinnings of the breakthrough are clear. Tkatchenko noted pointedly at the press conference to announce the signing: \"I want to take this opportunity to reassure Foreign Minister Wang Yi of Papua New Guinea's support to the 'One China' policy since both countries established diplomatic relations in 1976.\"\n\nDuring Wang's visit, China and PNG also signed a funding agreement toward information communication technology (ICT) cooperation between the two countries, which continues Beijing's increasing control over PNG's communications infrastructure.\n\nFor PNG, a \"Look North Policy\" has redirected its foreign energies away from traditional partners like Australia and New Zealand and toward Asia. It is part of the Marape government's vision to increase PNG's economic independence through a wider reach into more lucrative and populated markets.\n\nWhile Beijing has been following the kind of tied investment and loans and program-aid approach embodied in the latest deals - and in keeping with its aggressively pro-China Belt and Road Initiative - Australia has been taking a different route.\n\nSoon after Wang's visit to Port Moresby, Australia announced an AU$600 million budgetary assistance package for PNG.\n\nAustralia has been willing to prop up PNG's government coffers in unrestricted aid injections such as this for some time. Over the last four years, Canberra has provided AU$2.56 billion in budget support funds, untied to program or sector outcomes. Each has been a retrospective fix for budgetary shortcomings in PNG's bottom line the previous year.\n\nAustralia's money has little or no accountability mechanisms, even self-serving ones, and no real Australian private sector involvement.\n\nWhile both Chinese and Australian approaches are clearly and significantly different, both are in fact joined in terms of their negative outcomes for PNG.\n\nEvents this year have provided stark proof.\n\nIn January, PNG erupted in a wave of public protest against proposed public service pay cuts and widespread tax rate increases. While the uprising was a reaction to these actions, more general concerns like high unemployment, cost of living, high crime rates, and government corruption were soon referenced. PNG was in a state of emergency for two weeks and at least 22 people were killed in a week of chaos in the country.\n\nThen, on May 24, a devastating landslide in PNG's Enga province, north of Port Moresby, buried more than 2,000 people from Yambali village.\n\nIn contrast to the Marape government's quick efforts to quell riots in Port Moresby in January, central government action after the landslide was tragically absent. Relief and support were slow to materialize, leading to claims the government was more concerned about ongoing political battles in the capital.\n\nThese two examples embody a country in crisis. Even as trade deals are done with Beijing, and government coffers are filled by Canberra's generous handouts, New Guineans are questioning who is actually benefiting from the supposed progress.\n\nCriticisms not only of the current government, but of the prevailing economic and political system, are building. Many consider the country's leaders to be interested only in their own power and wealth. Faith in the PNG's leaders is low.\n\nWhile Australia and China have very different approaches in PNG, they are united in finding ways to alienate the very people they should be working with: New Guineans themselves.\n\nIt's clear that PNG's political elite has been distracted by the region's geostrategic tensions. Like many in the Indo-Pacific region, PNG's leaders have been caught up in playing one superpower against the other, directly as well as through allies like Australia.\n\nFor Australia and its partners in the region, the only sustainable direction is to redress this top-heavy approach. This means working more accountably, transparently, and directly with the people of PNG and devising ways to bring them and Australians together. Unless major powers like Australia, and local regional governments like PNG's, can get back to the business of actual government and leadership, the region, as well as specific populations will suffer.\n\nFor Canberra, a \"Third Way,\" favoring a people-centered relationship between Australians and New Guineans will almost certainly provide not only greater regional stability but plenty of popular support too.\n\nBut that would require new thinking, and that is a rare commodity in the current Indo-Pacific environment.", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Mark Dreyfus KC MP.\n\nAs part of the RPNGC capability uplift, the AFP, through the PNG-Australia Policing Partnership (PNG-APP) will work closely with the RPNGC Water Police Directorate to train its members in the vessel's operation.\n\nPPV Minigulai will assist RPNGC in the fight against transnational crime and will enable the RPNGC to deliver policing services to remote coastal communities across PNG.\n\nAFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw said the AFP was proud to support the commissioning of PPV Minigulai for the RPNGC.\n\n\"Police Patrol Vessel Minigulai will provide border protection, greater rescue capability and marine enforcement,\" Commissioner Kershaw said.\n\n\"This is an important tool in the fight against transnational organised crime, and we look forward to continuing to work closely with the RPNGC to help keep communities safe.\"\n\nRPNGC Commissioner David Manning said the PPV Minigulai is an important mechanism to strengthen the rule of law in remote communities and ensure the RPNGC maintain an effective presence across the maritime arena.\n\n\"This new Police Patrol Vessel is the largest maritime asset in the RPNGC fleet, and will ensure the RPNGC continues to develop capacity, going from strength-to-strength to deliver an effective policing service to communities across our Country,\" Commissioner Manning said.\n\nWhile in Port Moresby, Mr Dreyfus joined Commissioner Kershaw and RPNGC Commissioner David Manning on a tour of the Bomana Police Training College which will be the site of a new Recruit and Investigations Training Centre.\n\nThe new training centre will be delivered as part of the PNG-Australia Bilateral Security Agreement and will provide a regional centre of excellence to support the development of key capabilities by police forces across the Pacific.\n\nRPNGC officers also demonstrated less than lethal use of force training to the visiting delegation.\n\nThe AFP, through PNG-APP has been training RPNGC officers in less than lethal use of force as well as providing less than lethal munitions and equipment.\n\nThis addresses a capability gap for the RPNGC when responding to incidents such as civil disorder or armed offenders.\n\nThe training has been delivered to RPNGC officers based in Port Moresby and is now being delivered in Lae. Training will be rolled out to other Provincial centres including Mount Hagen and Kokopo in the near future.\n\nAlso as part of Australia's commitments under the PNG-Australia Bilateral Security Agreement, the AFP is supporting the RPNGC with the construction of police housing across priority provinces commencing with the construction of police barracks-styled accommodation in Port Moresby, Kokopo and Mount Hagen.\n\nThis will allow RPNGC recruits to be placed in regional centres upon graduation.\n\nCommissioner Kershaw and Commissioner Manning today also signed an extension of the Advisory Deployment of Australian Federal Police Memorandum of Understanding which will see AFP Advisors continue to work closely with their RPNGC counterparts until at least June 2027.\n\nCommissioner Kershaw said the AFP is committed to maintaining and enhancing its relationship with the RPNGC.\n\n\"The AFP and RPNGC has a longstanding and positive relationship working together on law enforcement cooperation activities,\" Commissioner Kershaw said.\n\n\"We look forward to continuing to work closely with the RPNGC to ensure they are equipped with the support and tools needed to deliver effective policing services for their communities and the wider region.\"\n\nCommissioner Manning said the continuation of the PNG-Australia Policing Partnership is an indicator of the strength and maturity of the relationship between the RPNGC and AFP.\n\n\"As longstanding partners, the RPNGC and AFP share a common view of the importance of ensuring police forces have the tools they need to meet the needs of their communities,\" Commissioner Manning said.\n\n\"Through the PNG-Australia Policing Partnership we are seeing a partnership that support us deliver region-leading training and capabilities to our police force, as well as support similar capabilities for police forces across our region.\"\n\n/Public Release.

Round 5 of the series will be held on June 14-15 and is being hosted by Temple Motorcycle Club in collaboration with Motorsport Enterprises. The event will feature some of Northern Ireland\u2019s top short circuit teams and riders including the likes of Korie McGreevy, Andy Reid, Ross Irwin and Jonny Campbell. In what will hopefully become the new normal at short circuit motorcycle race meetings, Round 5 of the Ulster Superbike Championship will be a two-day event incorporating Superbike, SuperSport, Supertwin, Classics and Sidecar classes.

He is currently dominating the USBK Championship following an impressive start to the series. Meanwhile, Irwin on his Magic Bullet Honda Fireblade, currently sits in third place in the Superbike Championship, while Ajay Carey has had a slower start to the season after having shoulder surgery. JMcC Roofing Team Rider Dean McMaster is another big fan of the Ulster Championship and brings plenty of experience from his road racing circuit this year. The JMcC Roofing Race Team has worked hard this season and proved themselves to be up for any challenge. Teammate and former BSB star Reid is chomping at the bit to get back in the saddle for Round 5, and hopes are high that his ZX10 Kawasaki will carry him into a 2024 USBK podium position. Andrew Smyth, MPW Kawasaki racing in the Supersport class on his Kawasaki 636, is currently sitting comfortably in fourth position and is looking forward to the two-day race meeting at Kirkistown in June, appreciating the value of the extra track time to fine tune his bike and ensure optimum performance when it matters most. With MacAdoo Racing Rider McGreevy pushing podium positions, Lisburn \u2019s Ryan Gibson, and Spence Engineering rider Aaron Spence all competing for pole positions, the heat is on, and every second will count. Up for grabs over the two days are substantial monetary prizes and a host of silverware. Sponsor SBT (Simple Business Telecom) Ireland will massively bolster the prize funds for the Superbike Races overall. Motorsport Enterprises themselves organising a 'shoot out\u2019 across the two days of racing, awarding the Top 15 Superbikes and Supersports the opportunity to win the \u2018Fastest Lap of the Meeting\u2019 Cup. Road Racing Ireland will present a trophy for \u2018Rider of the Meeting\u2019 and \u00a3100 prize money. The Philip Wylie Trophy will also be awarded to \u2018Best Newcomer\u2019 on the day. One of the organisers said: \"There is no doubt the June event at Kirkistown is one to be marked down in the racing calendar as \u2018Not To Be Missed'.

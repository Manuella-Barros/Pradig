{"id": 225127572, "title": "Tyre Nichols Case: Defense Lawyers Try To Introduce Damaging Evidence To Jury", "text": "Source: Memphis Police Department / Memphis Police Department UPDATED: 9:30 a.m. ET, May 29, 2024 The fight to get justice for the deadly police beating of Tyre Nichols continues. A federal judge heard arguments this week about whether the jury in the trial against the officers who killed Tyre Nichols should hear evidence found in his car the night he was killed by police in 2023. According to AP, on Tuesday, defense attorneys asked the judge if jurors could be introduced to evidence that Nichols had a hallucinogenic drug and stolen credit cards in his car when Memphis police pulled him over. Lawyers for the officers tried to convince the court that items discovered in Nichols\u2019 car after police beat him explain why he didn\u2019t pull over right away when police stopped him. The lawyers also claimed that the drugs found in the vehicle were the reason Nichols tried to run after officers pulled him out of his car. Officers would later catch up to Nichols and brutally beat him to death, just steps away from his house. From AP: Defense attorneys argued that the evidence is relevant because it explains why he evaded officers and was able to resist attempts by the officers to subdue him while corroborating the officers\u2019 perceptions of Nichols\u2019 demeanor. After the beating, officers speculated that Nichols was on drugs, which they believed influenced his behavior, the attorneys said. ___ Prosecutor Forrest Christian disagreed with the defense attorneys claiming the officers didn\u2019t know about the items in the car and didn\u2019t have them when he was being beaten. \u201cIt\u2019s just a character attack,\u201d Christian told the court. Defense attorney Martin Zummach pushed back, saying no evidence should be kept from the jury. \u201cLet the jury have all the facts,\u201d Zummach said. Tennessee Bill Reversing Traffic Stop Reforms After Tyre Nichols\u2019 Police Beating Death Signed Into Law A bill that repeals police traffic stop reforms adopted after the beating death of Tyre Nichols was signed into law on Thursday by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, potentially clearing the way for more innocent drivers to be legally brutalized by law enforcement. Lee, a Republican, signed the GOP-led legislation, the Associated Press reported. The bill was signed into law despite Nichols\u2019 parents speaking out about the legislation and pleading with lawmakers to keep the civil protections in place established after the unarmed 29-year-old Black man pulled over at a traffic stop for \u201creckless driving\u201d was beaten to death by five Memphis police officers who have all been charged with murder and federal civil rights charges. The new law enables police across the state to keep making such pretextual traffic stops for minor driving violations that data shows disproportionately affect Black drivers. \u201cI think what\u2019s most important for us to remember is that we can give law enforcement tools, but we\u2019ve got to hold law enforcement to a standard of using those tools appropriately, where there\u2019s an appropriate interaction with the public,\u201d Lee previously said about the bill. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we understand has happened all the time, and certainly their family would attest to that.\u201d Bill Undoing Traffic Stop Reforms After Police Beating Death Heads To Governor A bill expected to undo significant police reforms centered on the type of pretextual traffic stop that got Tyre Nichols beaten to death was passed on March 14 in the Tennessee state Senate. The development came a week after the state\u2019s House of Representatives voted to advance it. Now, the bill heads to the governor\u2019s desk, where it will likely be signed into law. Fox 13 reported: SB2572 passed the Tennessee Senate 26-6 on Thursday, March 14. If signed into law, the bill would \u201cprohibit a local governmental entity or official from adopting or enacting a resolution, ordinance, or policy that prohibits or limits the ability of a law enforcement agency to conduct traffic stops based on observation of or reasonable suspicion that the operator or a passenger in a vehicle has violated a local ordinance or state or federal law.\u201d Lawyers for Nichols\u2019 mother and stepfather, RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, said they were unsuccessful in convincing Republican State Sen. Bret Taylor to delay Thursday\u2019s vote. The following statement from RowVaughn and Rodney Wells was sent to NewsOne following the Senate passing SB2572: \u201cThe city of Memphis worked tirelessly to get ordinances passed in Tyre\u2019s name, so this bill hurts us deeply. Local Memphis leaders tried to speak with the state legislators pushing for this legislation, but they were brushed off \u2013\u2013 as were we. \u201cThis legislation was clearly targeted to take down the ordinances named after our son, and while we miss him dearly, this is about so much more than Tyre. There are many other Memphians that have experienced pretextual stops with police that ended with violence. Our goal was to create something in Memphis that could protect our community, but even after doing so, our success is fleeting. \u201cWe wish that instead of this political sabotage, we could have come together to discuss what is working and what isn\u2019t. Compromise could have happened, but we were never given the opportunity to try.\u201d Bill Advances Threatening Traffic Stop Reforms Enacted After Police Beating Death The family of Tyre Nichols sounded the alarm around proposed legislation that would undo existing police reform measures in Memphis after the bill on March 8 advanced closer to becoming law. The police reforms being threatened were installed after Nichols died following his brutal arrest during a traffic stop \u2014 the same kind of pretextual traffic stop at the center of the proposed legislation. Representatives for Nichols\u2019 family previously said that SB2572 would \u201cnullify\u201d legal measures put in place following Nichols\u2019 death on Jan. 10, 2023, including the Data Transparency Act and the Tyre Nichols Driving Equality Act. On Thursday, they reiterated that stance in a statement emailed to NewsOne: \u201cWe continue to urge the Tennessee Senate to reject SB2572 and preserve the essential police reforms that honor the memory of Tyre Nichols and serve to protect communities across our state. The proposed legislation represents a dangerous step back in the fight for accountability, transparency, and justice within law enforcement. We are moving dangerously backwards with this legislation and others like it, including those that eliminate DEI policies and efforts that were created in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder. \u201cThe Memphis ordinances, which we view as part of Tyre\u2019s legacy, were crafted with the goal of preventing future tragedies and fostering trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. SB2572 not only undermines these efforts, but also disregards the collective voice of the people who tirelessly advocated for change. \u201cWe call on Tennessee lawmakers to live up to the oath of their offices by prioritizing the safety and well-being of all citizens \u2013\u2013 they must reject SB2572 and uphold the integrity of our local police reform ordinances. Our resolve remains unwavering, and we will continue to fight for justice in Tyre\u2019s name \u2013\u2013 we hope our state senators will do the same.\u201d New Tennessee Bill Would \u2018Nullify\u2019 Police Traffic Stop Reforms Enacted After Beating Death Tyre Nichols\u2018 family is encouraging legislators in Tennessee to reject a bill that would undo police reform measures in Memphis, where four former police officers stand accused of murdering the unarmed driver by brutally beating him more than a year ago. Representatives for Nichols\u2019 family say that SB2572 would \u201cnullify\u201d legal measures put in place following Nichols\u2019 death on Jan. 10, 2023, including the Data Transparency Act and the Tyre Nichols Driving Equality Act. The Data Transparency Act maintains updated information about traffic stops in real time. The Tyre Nichols Driving Equality Act was enacted to prevent pretextual traffic stops like the one that led to Nichols\u2019 death. SB2572 would also allow police officers to resume using unmarked cars for traffic stops, such as what happened to Nichols. Allowing SB2572 to pass would make a \u201cmockery\u201d of Nichols\u2019 killing, his family said. \u201cThe current bill SB2572 that should be voted on next week in the Tennessee Senate would be a mockery and directly contradict that earlier resolution and further unjustly and unlawfully ratify the actions of the police officers and the City of Memphis as to their roles in Tyre\u2019s death,\u201d Nichols\u2019 family said this week in a statement emailed to NewsOne. Nichols\u2019 mother made a similar plea to Tennessee lawmakers. \u201cThis legislation would remove critical reforms the Memphis community fought for on behalf of my son Tyre, and would be a devastating step backwards,\u201d RowVaughn Wells said. \u201cOur communities deserve law enforcement that is held to the highest standard of integrity and accountability to begin to restore trust. We urge lawmakers to vote \u2018no\u2019 to SB2572.\u201d Federal trial pushed back for ex-cops accused of murder The federal trial for the four ex-Memphis police officers charged in the beating death of Nichols has been pushed back four months, the Associated Press reported in February 2024. Previously U.S. District Judge Mark Norris changed the trial date for the former cops from May 6 to Sept. 9 after defense lawyers requested more time to prepare for court. Lawyers said they needed more time to review more than 800 gigabytes of video, documents as well as other evidence in the case. \u201cThis case has a number of moving parts,\u201d Stephen Ross Johnson, the lawyer for former officer Emmitt Martin, told the court. \u201cWe just need additional time.\u201d Source: Lucy Garrett / Getty More video footage surfaces Last month, officials in Memphis released hours of more video footage from the fatal police beating of Nichols more than a year ago. Portions of the dozens of videos recorded by police body cameras show officers involved, including the five former cops charged with Nichols\u2019 brutal murder following a traffic stop, according to the Memphis Commercial Appeal, which reviewed the footage. The previously unreleased video also shows police trying to criminalize Nichols and claiming without proof the 29-year-old was on drugs after officers said they tasered him without achieving the desired effect. More from the Memphis Commercial Appeal: Footage from officer Chris Wilson\u2019s body-worn camera showed officers move Nichols from below a street sign, leaning him up against a car. Demetrius Haley, one of the five ex-MPD officers who has been criminally charged, begins explaining what he saw to other officers who had just made the scene. \u201cThat man got Tased, with the prongs running down f\u2013king Ross,\u201d Haley said. \u201cHe on something bad. We did him up, won\u2019t stop. We did it again, won\u2019t stop. I\u2019m talking about finna take folks out in oncoming traffic and everything.\u201d After a brief pause, Haley walks off camera, shaking his head, and said, \u201cF\u2013k, mane.\u201d Wilson, who is not facing criminal charges, then walks over to former officer Justin Smith, asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s up man? Good?\u201d before giving him a fist bump. While standing over Nichols, officers can be heard speculating that Nichols is \u201chigh as a kite,\u201d before talking about the force they used on him. \u201cIt was just a traffic stop,\u201d one officer, who cannot be seen on camera, said. \u201cShit, the motherf\u2013ker get out the car, and we were like, \u2018mane, bruh, chill.\u2019 Motherf\u2013ker started fighting.\u201d A previously released video showed Nichols trying to speak with officers before one pulled him from the car and took him to the ground during that initial traffic stop. \u201cHe strong as a motherf\u2013ker,\u201d former officer Tadarrius Bean said to some of the bystanders as EMTs evaluated Nichols. Attorneys representing Nichols\u2019 family said they have also obtained the footage. \u201cAs our legal team reviews the new body cam videos of Tyre Nichols\u2019 horrific death at the hands of Memphis Police, we expect the videos to affirm what we have said from day one: that there was absolutely no justification for the officers\u2019 brutal and inhumane actions,\u201d attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said in a statement emailed to NewsOne. \u201cWe will continue our unflinching look at this tragedy and stand strongly with Tyre\u2019s family in their continued grief and fight for justice.\u201d The dozens of videos released on Tuesday can be viewed by clicking here. Memphis officials said they would be releasing additional documents in the case in the coming weeks. Source: CHENEY ORR / Getty Tyre Nichols\u2019 legal team hopes DOJ can reign in specialized police units\u2019 terror On Jan 10, 2024 \u2014 exactly one year since the tragic killing of Tyre Nichols at the hands of Memphis Police \u2014 the DOJ announced a new publication called Considerations for Specialized Units: A Guide for State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies to Ensure Appropriateness, Effectiveness, and Accountability. According to DOJ, the guide, which was commissioned after the killing of Tyre Nichols, is designed to support law enforcement agencies and communities across the country as they assess the appropriateness of the use of specialized units, and, where units are deemed appropriate, ensure the necessary management and oversight of such units to advance effective and just policing practices. The guidance from the DOJ looks at four main stages of specialized units: formation, personnel selection and supervision, management and accountability, and community engagement. \u201cAfter the tragic death of Tyre Nichols and public scrutiny of the SCORPION unit, we made it a priority at the Justice Department to develop a practical resource for law enforcement and community leaders assessing the use of specialized units in police agencies,\u201d said Associate Attorney General Gupta. Attorneys for the family of Tyre Nichols said they hope police nationwide take heed of the new DOJ guidelines. \u201cWe, along with the family of Tyre Nichols, are thankful for the diligent work done by the Department of Justice, and specifically Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, in addressing this matter,\u201d attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said in a statement emailed to NewsOne. \u201cWe hope this guidance provides police departments with a clear outline of when these specialized units may be appropriate, when they most certainly are not appropriate, and how to properly staff them with officers who will properly execute their explicit duties.\u201d Candlelight Vigils To Honor Tyre Nichols Source: JIM WATSON / Getty On Jan. 7, more than 100 people gathered for two solemn candlelight vigils to honor his memory and continue the call for justice. During the vigil in Memphis, Nichols\u2019 mother, stepfather and three siblings talked about his legacy and how hard the past year has been without Tyre. The Memphis candlelight vigil occurred on Castlegate Lane and Ross Road and the vigil in his hometown of Sacramento took place at the Tyre Nichols Skatepark. His mother, RowVaughn Wells wore the sneakers she bought him the last Christmas they spent together as she recalled the agony of not having her son with her during the holidays. \u201cRegardless of wherever my kids are, they\u2019re going to call me, they\u2019re going to come by if they\u2019re close enough,\u201d Wells said during the vigil. \u201cThis year, I didn\u2019t get that from Tyre. I didn\u2019t get a phone call. I didn\u2019t get a text message. I didn\u2019t get a \u2018Merry Christmas.\u2019 I didn\u2019t get none of that from my baby this year. \u201cThat\u2019s the most hurtful thing because he used to try to be the first one to call,\u201d Wells said. \u201c\u2018Mama, was I the first one to call you today?\u2019\u201d Source: Twitter / Twitter On Jan. 7, 2023, Tyre Nichols tragically lost his life following a violent beating by five Memphis Police Officers. Those officers are set to start their trial in May. \u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we approach the one-year commemoration of the horrific beating death of Tyre Nichols by members of the Memphis Police Department,\u201d attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said in a statement to NewsOne. \u201cWhat happened on January 7, 2023, was an unspeakable and inhumane tragedy that needlessly took the life of a gentle and peaceful person who was loved by so many. We extend our continued condolences to his beautiful family. We also see this weekend as one that provides hope, as the family is touched by the many gestures in Memphis and around the world to remember Tyre\u2019s generous spirit\u201d Crump and his legal team also said they aren\u2019t stopping the fight for justice for Tyre Nichols. \u201cOur legal team is fiercely committed to fighting for justice for Tyre and vigorously restate our assertions that the Scorpion Unit officers involved acted at the direction of a Memphis Police Department policy that violated the civil rights of innocent civilians and caused needless pain to many. Work continues on the civil litigation.\u201d One Officer Pleads Guilty On Nov. 2, one of the five fired Memphis Police Department (MPD) officers accused of murdering Tyre Nichols officially pleaded guilty to his federal indictment, the Associated Press reported. Desmond Mills, Jr. stands charged with excessive force, deliberate indifference, conspiracy to witness tamper and obstruction of justice in a federal indictment that could have resulted in a life sentence with a conviction on all counts. Mills entered his new plea on Thursday. The plea came in exchange for Mills\u2019 cooperation with prosecutors, who recommended the disgraced former cop serve just 15 years for the brutal killing of Nichols, who was unarmed when the group of all Black officers beat the 29-year-old Black man to death during a pretextual traffic stop earlier this year. The change in plea is only for the federal case and he is still expected to stand trial for the state murder charges and a federal civil case filed by Ben Crump that he and his four co-defendants \u2014 Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin and Justin Smith \u2014 are all facing. Crump and personal injury lawyer Antonio Romanucci welcomed the latest update in the murder case. \u201cDesmond Mills\u2019 plea today is entirely consistent with our allegations in the civil lawsuit against the City of Memphis. We stand strong in our belief that these officers, including Mills, acted at the direction of a policy that not only violated civil rights of innocent civilians but which caused needless pain to many,\u201d Crump and Romanucci said in a statement mailed to NewsOne. \u201cThe MPD and its SCORPION unit directed, trained, and encouraged officers like Mills to commit baseless and horrific acts of violence against innocent individuals like Tyre Nichols. We vigorously restate our assertion that those policies were behind what ultimately caused Mills and four other Scorpion officers to kill Tyre Nichols.\u201d Trial date set for accused former officers In September, U.S. District Judge Mark S. Norris set a May 2024 trial date for Bean, Mills, Haley, Martin and Smith, pushing back the start from its original March 2024 target, according to Commercial Appeal. The ex-cops were federally indicted Sept. 12, each facing four counts of willfully depriving Nichols of his constitutional rights, violating Nichols\u2019 right to be free from a law enforcement officer\u2019s deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs, conspiring to cover up their use of unlawful force by omitting material information, by providing false and misleading information to their supervisor and others, committing an obstruction offense by intentionally omitting material information, and providing false and misleading information to two MPD officers tasked with writing MPD reports about the arrest of Nichols. The maximum sentence the five former officers face is life in prison, and there is no parole in the federal system. Judge denies three ex-cops separate trials in state case Shelby County Criminal Court Judge James Jones Jr. in October rejected requests to have separate trials for Bean, Mills and Smith, whose lawyers argued their clients could not receive a fair trial if they were tried together. Meanwhile, a $550 million federal lawsuit against the City of Memphis and some of the former police officers accused in a separate instance of alleged police brutality against a different Black man was paused since September \u201cuntil all the criminal cases are resolved,\u201d the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported. But that pause came before the federal indictment of the five officers, prompting a defense attorney to seek an indefinite pause for the federal lawsuit. The ruling came prior to the federal indictment, and defense attorney John Keith Perry said a complete stay in that case should result in a complete stay in the Nichols civil case. \u201cThey\u2019re not the same case, but we think the implications in our case are heightened if the court would undermine the Harris case ruling,\u201d John Keith Perry, the attorney defending Bean, said at the time. \u201c\u2026If you delve into discovery in this case, the court is taking a position that this case is less problematic than the Harris case.\u201d Ex-cops charged with federal crimes The five fired MPD officers accused of murdering Nichols were formally indicted in September on federal crimes in addition to the existing state charges for beating the unarmed Black motorist to death in January. The Justice Department announced that Bean, Mills, Haley, Martin and Smith are now each facing four federal counts of willfully depriving Nichols of his constitutional rights, violating Nichols\u2019 right to be free from a law enforcement officer\u2019s deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs, conspiring to cover up their use of unlawful force by omitting material information, and by providing false and misleading information to their supervisor and to others, and committing an obstruction offense by intentionally omitting material information, and providing false and misleading information to two MPD officers tasked with writing MPD reports about the arrest of Nichols. \u201cThese federal charges reflect the Justice Department\u2019s unwavering commitment to protecting the constitutional and civil rights of every American and preserving the integrity of the criminal justice system,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division said in a statement. \u201cWe stand ready to hold law enforcement officers accountable for their misconduct because no one is above the law in our country.\u201d Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Nichols\u2019 family, welcomed the federal charges. \u201cThe news today from the United States Justice Department that there will be criminal accountability on the federal level for Tyre\u2019s death gives his family hope as they continue to grieve his loss and inspire change in his honor,\u201d Crump said in a statement ahead of a planned press conference with Nichols\u2019 family. \u201cWe applaud AG Garland and Assistant AG Clarke for their tireless efforts to create federal accountability for these officers who were selected to be part of the Memphis Police Department\u2019s SCORPION unit and savagely ended Tyre\u2019s life, setting a critical precedent for accountability and justice.\u201d Ex-officers seek separate trials In June, two of the former cops facing murder charges tried to distance themselves from the other defendants in the harrowing brutality case. Bean and Smith had their lawyers file motions seeking separate trials, the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported. \u201cBean and Smith never punched or kicked [Nichols], and after he was successfully secured Bean and Smith are seen sitting [Nichols] up and checking on his ability to breathe,\u201d Bean\u2019s attorney claimed in the motion for the accused murderer. \u201c\u2026Video evidence shows that not every officer participated in the arrest with the same conduct. Unfortunately, joint trials may end with a result that weighs all conduct the same, and a less culpable defendant may be unfairly and unduly prejudiced by the actions or evidence related to a more heavily involved co-defendant.\u201d The motion continued: \u201cThe indictment lists charges that allegedly took place at both points of interaction with [Nichols], and the charges are levied against all 5 officers. However, Bean and Mills were over 1 mile away when the initial interaction took place.\u201d The motion also added: \u201cSuch complexity can be daunting to a jury and diminishes their ability to assess each defendant individually. When a case is being tried with multiple defendants who have been charged with multiple offenses, the sheer volume of evidence, along with the arguments for and against each piece of evidence could potentially be a source of confusion.\u201d Smith\u2019s lawyer made similar claims in his motion. \u201cThe defense of Smith will be prejudiced by including Smith in the trial of the other defendants who may be found to be culpable for conduct that arose at a scene where Smith was not present,\u201d Smith\u2019s motion said in part. \u201cThe jury could likely determine that the conduct of other defendants was so culpable and inflammatory that Smith could be found guilty, not based on evidence against Smith, but the evidence against other defendants. Therefore, Smith, as a co-defendant, finds himself in an antagonistic posture with one, some or all of the other co-defendants.\u201d All five of the defendants stand charged with second-degree murder, two counts of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated assault, two counts of official misconduct and one count of official oppression. Tyre Nichols\u2019 autopsy results The official autopsy report for Nichols was shared with the family in May, revealing that he \u201cdied of brain injuries from blunt force trauma.\u201d The report also revealed that Nichols\u2019 blood alcohol level was .049, well below the legal limit of .08 in the state of Tennessee. The findings about Nichols\u2019 blood alcohol level contradict first responders\u2019 accounts that Nichols was drunk and high at the time of his death. The autopsy is set to be released to the public soon. Nationally renowned civil rights and personal injury attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci issued a statement following the family of Nichols being briefed on his autopsy results by Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy. \u201cThe legal team representing the family of Nichols acknowledges the release of the medical examiner\u2019s report, the contents of which are highly consistent with our own reporting back in January of this year. We know now what we knew then. Tyre Nichols died from blunt force trauma and the manner of death was homicide. The official autopsy report further propels our commitment to seeking justice for this senseless tragedy.\u201d On Tuesday, Mulroy decided not to charge Preston Hemphill, one of the former officers who was involved in the incident that ended with Nichols losing his life. Mulroy said he didn\u2019t believe criminal charges were appropriate for Hemphill since he was not at the second scene where officers took turns beating Nichols. \u201cBy no means do we endorse the conduct of Officer Hemphill,\u201d Mulroy said. \u201cNote that the Memphis Police Department did, in fact, take administrative action against Mr. Hemphill\u2026But we do not believe that criminal charges are appropriate. Mr. Hemphill was not present for the initial traffic stop, nor was he present when the other officers removed Mr. Nichols forcibly from his car and put him on the ground\u2026He had to make his decisions based on what he knew, or what he thought was happening, and was following the lead of other officers.\u201d Although Hemphill wasn\u2019t charged, he is expected to testify in the case. Family of Tyre Nichols files federal lawsuit A federal lawsuit was filed in April by Nichols\u2019 family against the city of Memphis and its police department. According to the $550 million suit, the officers who brutally beat Nichols, causing his death, were \u201cunqualified, untrained, and unsupervised\u201d and the beating was the \u201cdirect and foreseeable product of the unconstitutional policies, practices, customs, and deliberate indifference of the City of Memphis and its police officials.\u201d The suit also compared Nichols\u2019 beating to the murder of Emmett Till, calling the officers who beat him \u201ca modern-day lynch mob.\u201d \u201cUnlike Till, this lynching was carried out by those adorned in department sweatshirts and vests and their actions were sanctioned \u2013 expressly and implicitly \u2013 by the City of Memphis,\u201d the suit said. Family attorney Ben Crump said the suit should serve as a message to police around the country. \u201cThis landmark lawsuit is not only to get the justice for Tyre Nichols in the civil courts but it is also a message that is being sent to cities all across America who have these police oppression units that have been given the license by city leaders to go in and terrorize Black and brown communities,\u201d said Crump at a news conference. Ex-Memphis police officers decertified The four ex-Memphis police officers charged in the death of Nichols will never work as enforcement in the state of Tennessee again. Last month, the Peace Officer Standards & Training Commission voted to decertify former officers Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin and Justin Smith. Former officer Desmond Mills surrendered his certification, which was then approved by the panel. The vote came after the MPD requested the decertification of seven of the former Memphis officers involved. According to AP, none of the fired officers attended their hearings with the commission prior to Friday\u2019s vote. Three officers have yet to have their decertification hearing before the commission and one has retired. Outrage after officer involved in the death of Tyre Nichols retires A Memphis police officer who was on the scene when Nichols was brutally beaten by police was allowed to retire before he was expected to be fired. According to Memphis City Council Vice Chairman JB Smiley, senior officer Lt. DeWayne Smith retired just one day before a disciplinary hearing on the case. Nationally renowned civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci called Lt. Smith\u2019s move to resign before he was held accountable cowardice and urged officials to take action. \u201cThe Nichols family and their legal team are deeply disturbed that Memphis Police allowed and accepted the retirement of Lt. Dewayne Smith, in light of his immediately pending disciplinary hearing for his decisions and behavior related to Tyre Nichols\u2019 death,\u201d the lawyers wrote in a statement. \u201cWe believe Lt. Smith was the highest-ranking officer at the scene after the brutal beating, and we\u2019ve seen that Smith observed Tyre\u2019s dire medical condition and did not render or direct immediate medical attention.\u201d Crump and Romanucci also claim that Smith mishandled the scene and lied to Tyre\u2019s parents after the brutal beating that took his life. \u201cFurther, police reports indicate Smith failed to fully assess the scene, or examine the facts behind the officers\u2019 narrative, which was false,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cTyre\u2019s parents believe Smith was one of the first officers who came to their house and told them about Tyre\u2019s beating, said Tyre was involved in a DUI or on drugs, and did not tell them about the severity of the situation or allow them to see their son. In fact, Tyre\u2019s mother asked if she could see her son in the hospital and Lt. Smith told her no. We call for Memphis police and officials to do everything in their power to hold Lt. Smith and all of those involved fully accountable and not allow Lt. Smith to cowardly sidestep the consequences of his actions. His cowardice in resigning and not facing his own disciplinary board to defend himself is not an end-around on accountability or reckoning.\u201d Judge blocks release of more Tyre Nichols arrest videos There is outrage after a judge blocked the release of more than 20 hours of additional video evidence from the brutal arrest of Nichols that led to the young Black man\u2019s death in Memphis in January. The video footage had been scheduled to be released on Wednesday. The release of the evidence has been delayed indefinitely, according to the court order that said in part: \u201cThe release of this information shall be subject to further orders of the court and, in the public interest, will be ordered as soon as practicable.\u201d The Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered the eulogy at Nichols\u2019 funeral, described the delay as being unacceptable. \u201cDelaying the release of this footage is delaying justice for Tyre Nichols and his family,\u201d Sharpton said in a statement emailed to NewsOne. \u201cThe first round of body camera footage was disturbing on its own \u2013 and should be enough to convict all officers charged with this murder. What else are these cops worried this new footage is going to show?\u201d Sharpton added: \u201cTo tell the public you will release more evidence and then pull it back at the 11th hour only causes more frustration for a city still reeling from this senseless killing.\u201d The court order was issued on the same day that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it plans to conduct a review of MPD\u2019s policies as they pertain to the use of force, strategies for de-escalating and specialized units like the one involved in Nichols\u2019 brutal arrest. \u201cIn the wake of Tyre Nichols\u2019s tragic death, the Justice Department has heard from police chiefs across the country who are assessing the use of specialized units and, where used, appropriate management, oversight and accountability for such units,\u201d Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said in a statement on Wednesday. One day earlier, the city of Memphis passed five public safety ordinances on data transparency, traffic stops and police oversight, the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported. Ex-EMT blames the police Former Memphis EMT Robert Long, who was fired after the fatal beating of Nichols, testified last week in front of the Tennessee Emergency Medical Services Board. During his testimony, he told the board when arrived on the scene police were \u201cimpeding patient care, refusing to free Nichols from his handcuffs in order for him to receive aid. Long continued to detail his account of events from the Jan. 7 incident which resulted in the death of Nichols. He testified that after arriving on the scene, he did a visual assessment of Nichols and noticed he was beaten pretty badly. When he asked Nichols what happened, Nichols responded, \u201cI want to stand up and be uncuffed.\u201d When Long asked the police what happened, they responded, \u201cHe ran from us.\u201d He then told the board that MPD refused to take the handcuff off Nichols. \u201cMPD is leaning over the patient in his face saying loudly that the patient is not going anywhere and that they are not going to uncuff him, impeding patient care,\u201d said Long. Long also told the board that because Nichols was handcuffed, it made it difficult to check his vitals. Long, his partner JaMichael Sandridge and another EMT Lt. Michelle Whitaker, were all fired for their inaction in response to the brutal beating of Nichols. A fourth Memphis Fire Department employee is also under investigation. Memphis Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Sink confirmed the investigation to reporters last month but says her staff hasn\u2019t decided on the consequences the employee may face. According to AP, Sink also said the employee arrived on the scene a lot later than others \u201cand provided medical care and transported Mr. Nichols to the hospital.\u201d The name of the employee hasn\u2019t been released to the public, but Sink reassured reporters she was taking the \u201csituation very seriously.\u201d \u201cWe are doing a very thorough investigation because we want to make sure that everybody understands what their role is and what the expectations are for them in a situation like this,\u201d said Sink. \u201cSome of them are minor players and some of them are major players. But everybody had a role, and they\u2019re expected to perform that role in accordance with policies or training and our expectations.\u201d Accused murderers have their day in court The five former police officers accused of murdering Nichols are scheduled to be in a Memphis courtroom on Friday, making it their first appearances before a judge in the case, the Associated Press reported. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith, who were all charged with second-degree murder for Nichols\u2019 death, are expected to be in Shelby County Criminal Court with their lawyers more than three weeks after they were fired for their violent roles stemming from a traffic stop Jan. 7. Nichols died from his injuries Jan. 10. All five men are Black and have also been charged with aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. Their court appearances follow two other Memphis police officers who were suspended without pay after it was revealed they tried to conceal their roles in the traffic stop. From ABC News: The Shelby County Sheriff\u2019s Office announced in a press release Wednesday that Johntavious Bowers and Jeremy Watkins, who have been deputies since June 2021, were suspended without pay for five days after an administrative investigation into their conduct. The sheriff\u2019s office said both Bowers and Watkins \u201cappeared on the scene following the physical confrontation\u201d on Jan. 7 between Memphis police officers and Nichols, who died from his injuries in a local hospital three days later. A \u201cthorough review of the circumstances\u201d determined that the two deputies violated several regulations, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Both Bowers and Watkins violated radio communication procedures, mobile video recording system procedures as well as patrol field job duties and responsibilities. Watkins also violated a fourth regulation: operational responsibility of daily activity log at 201 Poplar, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. The suspensions indicate the investigation is ongoing and possibly widening as the fallout affects other city agencies. Firefighters union defends personnel involved in traffic stop The head of the Memphis Fire Fighters Association recently backed the EMTs who were fired after the tragic death of Nichols at the hands of police. According to AP, Thomas Malone, the head of the union, said the employees who arrived on the scene the night Nichols was brutally beaten weren\u2019t given enough information as they responded to the call for medical help. \u201cOur members were not given adequate information upon dispatch or upon arrival of the scene,\u201d Malone wrote in a letter to city councilmembers. \u201cQuite frankly, there was information withheld by those already on the scene which caused our members to handle things differently than they should have.\u201d Malone also defended the entire fire department, assuring that its employees \u201cserve this city and its citizens with purpose and intent each and every day.\u201d Three fire department employees were fired and 13 police officers have been disciplined after the death of Nichols. Five former police officers have been charged with murder. Former officer says he used proper training during Tyre Nichols\u2019 arrest One of the former officers involved in the traffic stop and deadly beating of Tyre Nichols says he believed he used proper department training and tactics during Nichols\u2019 arrest. During an MPD hearing, which took place after Nichols\u2019 death, ex-officer Justin Smith said he believed he handled Nichols\u2019 arrest by the book. \u201cIt is my contention that I personally utilized the training and defensive tactics provided to me as a Memphis police officer in attempting to handcuff (Nichols),\u201d Smith wrote in the statement. Smith\u2019s written statement came as a part of MPD\u2019s internal investigation and was obtained by the Memphis Commercial Appeal through a public records request. Smith also never mentioned the use of punches, kicks or baton strikes in his description of events. He also \u201ccategorically\u201d denied \u201cutilizing any defensive weapons other than OC spray (pepper spray).\u201d But body camera footage seems to contradict Smith\u2019s statement. Since Nichols\u2019 death, other community members who had encounters with Memphis Police are coming forward. According to AP, Monterrious Harris, 22, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, accusing the same officers who murdered Nichols, of violating his rights during a similarly violent arrest three days before Nichols\u2019 arrest. According to the lawsuit, Harris\u2019 car was \u201cswarmed by a large group of assailants wearing black ski-masks, dressed in black clothing, brandishing guns, other weapons, hurling expletives and making threats to end his life if he did not exit his car.\u201d Harris believed he was being robbed and tried to back up his car before hitting something. The lawsuit also stated that once Harris got out of the vehicle he was \u201cgrabbed, punched, kicked, and assaulted\u201d for up to two minutes.\u201d The suit also accuses officers of fabricating evidence to support charges against Harris, including being a convicted felon in possession of a handgun, criminal trespass and evading arrest. Memphis City Council discusses departmental reforms The Memphis City Council discussed several public safety proposals and departmental reforms with the city\u2019s police chief and fire chief on Feb. 7. The long-awaited discussion came nearly a month after the council released the horrific police beating and arrest video of Nichols. According to CNN, the meeting was conducted by the council\u2019s Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee. The unit assessed 11 proposals including an \u201cordinance to establish a procedure for an independent review of police training; an ordinance to clarify \u201cappropriate\u201d ways of conducting traffic stops\u201d and \u201can ordinance to require police only to make traffic stops with marked cars.\u201dThe council, which is made up of 13 members, was led by chairman Martavius Jones. During the meeting, officials said that seven other officers could face discipline for Nichols\u2019 death. The officers will receive an internal \u201cstatement of charges,\u201d a document that will notify them of policy violations, according to City Attorney Jessica Sink. A hearing and a written decision will follow. What happened To Tyre Nichols? Nichols died on Jan. 10, three days after he was pulled over at a traffic stop for \u201creckless driving.\u201d Authorities said the incident occurred shortly after six officers from the department walked over to the young motorist\u2019s vehicle and demanded he step out of the car. Bodycam footage captured Preston Hemphill, the only white officer present during the fatal arrest, grabbing Nichols out of the vehicle before he was forced to the ground and given conflicting demands. Hemphill fired a stun gun at Nichols after he managed to escape from the police. Sadly, the five Black officers caught the young motorist just steps away from his mother\u2019s home. As they fought to detain the father of one, officers used a baton to beat him repeatedly. They used pepper spray and kicked him several times during the violent arrest. Nichols, an aspiring photographer, succumbed to his injuries three days later. Since the arrest, Memphis Police Chief C.J. Davis said her office has found no proof to substantiate claims of Nichols\u2019 \u201creckless driving.\u201d On Feb. 1, an emotional funeral service was held to honor Nichols\u2019 life and legacy at the Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church in Memphis. Social justice activist Tamika Palmer, Vice President Kamala Harris and Rev. Al Sharpton were some of the notable figures that attended the tearful service. Before his death, Nichols had worked with his stepfather at FedEx for about nine months, his family said. Relatives described the young motorist as an avid skateboarder who loved photographing sunsets and spending time with his mother. What happened to the officers involved? Shortly after the brutal arrest video surfaced, the five Black officers involved \u2014 Bean, Haley, Martin III, Mills and Smith \u2014 were fired and charged with second-degree murder, official misconduct and official oppression. Hemphill was also terminated from the department for making several violations, including \u201cpersonal conduct, truthfulness, compliance with regulations concerning a taser and compliance with regulations concerning equipment and inventory,\u201d according to a tweet posted by MPD on Feb. 3. All the officers were part of a specialized unit called the SCORPION unit. It was swiftly disbanded after news of Nichols\u2019 death made headlines. Who else was held responsible for Nichols\u2019 death? Three emergency medical technicians and another lieutenant were fired for failing \u201cto conduct an adequate patient assessment\u201d of Nichols after they arrived at the scene to find Nichols battered and bruised. Authorities said officials waited over 20 minutes to render aid to the young Memphis resident before calling medical assistance. SEE ALSO: DOJ To Participate In Independent Review Of Memphis P.D.

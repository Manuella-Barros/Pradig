Student loan refinancing is an option to consolidate student loans or refinance at a lower interest rate. Refinancing student loans may help you pay less interest over time or secure a longer repayment term to free up finances for other goals. Types of Loans Eligible for Refinancing Most student loans can be refinanced. That means you can refinance federal and private student loans as well as both fixed- and variable-rate loans. However, you must meet lender qualification criteria to obtain the student loan refinance rates you were hoping for. Eligibility criteria can include a good credit score, stable income, low to moderate debt-to-income ratio, a degree and apossible co-signer. Consolidation vs. Refinancing Consolidation and refinancing are both good options for taking control of student loan debts. Refinancing is an option to combine federal and any private loans into a single new loan with a single monthly payment. In contrast, consolidating combines federal loans into a single new loan amount. Both are good options, but refinancing means you will give up federal student loans for a single private student loan. Consolidating is a better option than refinancing to maintain federal loan benefits. Refinancing also can be a good option if you want simplified payments, extended terms or more flexible repayment options. Pros and Cons of Refinancing Student Loans The pros and cons of refinancing student loans vary by financial situation. Here is an overview. Is Refinancing Right for You? When to consider refinancing depends on your financial situation. If you have a higher interest rate, private loans or prefer to consolidate into a single loan payment, refinancing can be a good choice. If you have low-interest federal student loans, refinancing usually isn't a good choice. Likewise, if you are close to paying off student loans or won't qualify If your monthly payments are high and you can refinance with better terms or a longer repayment period, refinancing can be a good choice. It can free up necessary cash in your monthly budget to focus on long-term savings or other goals.

Ponting, who was head coaching the Delhi Capitals in IPL 2024, claimed that if the Men in Blue lack something in their team, then it is the count of the left-handers.\n\nRicky Ponting is of the view that Rahul Dravid and co. will have to make a huge decision on whether they want to see Yashasvi Jaiswal open with Rohit Sharma. But regardless of this headache, Ponting stated that he would be backing Virat Kohli to open with the Indian skipper. Punter was, in fact, \"pretty sure\" about Kohli appearing at the top of the order.\n\n\"They [selectors] have still got a decision to make because (Yashasvi) Jaiswal is in that squad and one thing they haven't got a lot in their team is left-hand batters. So they've got a decision to make with Jaiswal, but I'm pretty sure that they'll go with Kohli and Rohit Sharma [as openers].\" - Ponting said via ICC.com.\n\nRicky Ponting then criticized the Indian fans for always trying to write Virat Kohli off and finding a reason to not select him due to his T20 game. However, for the 3-time 50-over World Cup winner, Kohli will be the first pick in India's playing XI after captain Rohit Sharma.\n\nPonting believes that Kohli can play a similar role for India as he is playing for the RCB as an opening batsman. The DC head coach concluded by saying that if the batters around Kohli - Rohit, Surya, and Hardik Pandya among others are able to get their strike rate sky high, then it will be icing on the cake.\n\n\"It's funny with Virat. I think people in India just always try to find a reason not to pick him or a reason why he's maybe not as good as some of these other guys in the T20 game.\"", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ponting", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Ponting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faf_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Faf du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashasvi_Jaiswal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yashasvi Jaiswal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Capitals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Capitals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Dravid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/ViratKohliandRickyPonting.jpg?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588910", "eventUri": "eng-9588910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

So, class and experience like that, you can't replace,\" Ponting told ICC.\n\n\"It's funny with Virat. I think people in India just always try to find a reason not to pick him or a reason why he's maybe not as good as some of these other guys in the T20 game,\" he added.\n\nKohli produced a masterful innings of 82 against Pakistan at the 2022 T20 World Cup to engineer a thrilling last-ball win.\n\n\"I remember having this chat and some other chats I did for the ICC about there's some talk about Virat not being in their team only last year, but what happened when the big games come around, he was one of the guys who got the job done,\" Ponting said.\n\nKohli has been opening for RCB this season but he has primarily batted at the no.3 spot for India. With captain Rohit Sharma set to open, it's likely Kohli will partner him at the top but the presence of young Yashasvi Jaiswal who bats left-handed and has proven his credentials as a world-class opener complicates the task of the team management.\n\n\"They (selectors) have still got a decision to make (on the opening pair) because (Yashasvi) Jaiswal is in that squad and one thing they haven't got a lot in their team is left-hand batters,\" Ponting said.\n\n\"So they've got a decision to make with Jaiswal (batting position), but I'm pretty sure that they'll go with Kohli and Rohit Sharma (as openers). He can play his role at the top. And if you've got the right guys around him scoring (like) Suryakumar (Yadav)... Rohit Sharma's going to have a high strike rate. These other guys can go in there and play their way,\" he added.\n\nPonting though agrees that the T20 landscape has changed dramatically from what it was 3-4 years ago and teams now want their top-order batters to play impactful knocks rather than long innings.\n\n\"The mantra I think for the teams three or four years ago, was making sure that someone at the top of the order made 80 or 100, even if it took them 60 balls, it didn't really matter,\" Ponting said.\n\n\"I think it's sort of shifting now to be more of a strike rate based game where you can have a massive impact on a game with a 40 off 15 balls rather than getting an 80 off 55 balls sort of thing,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ponting", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Ponting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashasvi_Jaiswal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yashasvi Jaiswal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/05/virat-kohli-rcb-ipl-2024-4-2024-05-ac010e8238eb6938fc92855e994e33bb-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588910", "eventUri": "eng-9588910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Despite leading the scoring chart in IPL 2024 with 708 runs from 14 innings, Kohli has been often criticised for his strike rate at the top of the order. His selection in the T20 WC squad also sparked a debate around India's conservative approach in a slam-bang era of T20 cricket.\n\nBut Ponting is shocked and perplexed why people in India try to 'find reasons' to not select Kohli for the national team and added that Kohli would be his \"first pick\" for the T20 World Cup in the Americas.\n\n\"He (Kohli) is the first pick for me for India.

I think people in India just always try to find a reason not to pick him or a reason why he's maybe not as good as some of these other guys in the T20 game,\" the former Australian captain and Delhi Capitals head coach told ICC.\n\nTeam India is facing a conundrum about the openers in the marquee event. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are India's three opening options at the World Cup. Some believe Kohli and Jaiswal should open the innings while some say Rohit should open with Jaiswal to bring balance to the top order.\n\nBut Ponting feels Kohli should open the innings with skipper Rohit.\n\n\"They (selectors) have still got a decision to make (on the opening pair) because (Yashasvi) Jaiswal is in that squad and one thing they haven't got a lot in their team is left-hand batters.\n\n\"So they've got a decision to make with Jaiswal (batting position), but I'm pretty sure that they'll go with Kohli and Rohit Sharma (as openers),\" added Ponting.\n\nWith a century and five fifties, Kohli has led from the front to help RCB make a sensational comeback to qualify for the playoffs with six straight wins.\n\nKohli has batted at a strike rate of 155.60 this season - his best in the 17 years that he has played for the Royal Challengers.\n\nPonting hailed Kohli and said that in times when Strike Rates have taken precedence over averages one should not forget that it was the Indian superstar who stepped up on the big stage in India's 2022 T20 World Cup campaign. The RCB superstar was a key player in India's campaign in the 2022 edition, scoring an unbeaten 82 against Pakistan and a half-century against England in the semifinals.\n\nKohli and Rohit took a sabbatical from T20I cricket after India's 2022 WC campaign. The duo was called up by the selectors at the start of the year for the T20I series against Afghanistan, a decision which was a clear indicator of the management's plan to include the veterans in the World Cup squad. With Hardik Pandya struggling with injuries and inconsistent form, Rohit was handed back India's captaincy reigns ahead of the T20 World Cup 2024 in the West Indies and the USA starting on June 2.",

However, according to Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting, such doubts are unfounded.\n\nIn the world of cricket, few debates are as persistent as the one surrounding the inclusion of Virat Kohli in India's T20 International squad. Despite his stellar track record, questions linger about his suitability for the fast-paced format. However, according to Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting, such doubts are unfounded.\n\nPonting, known for his astute cricketing acumen, has hailed Kohli as a quintessential big-match player. In a recent statement to the International Cricket Council (ICC), Ponting expressed his bemusement at the ongoing debate, emphasizing Kohli's indispensability.\n\n\"He (Kohli) is the first pick for me for India. So, class and experience like that, you can't replace,\" Ponting told ICC, debunking any notions of Kohli's decline in T20 cricket. \"It's funny with Virat. I think people in India just always try to find a reason not to pick him or a reason why he's maybe not as good as some of these other guys in the T20 game.\"\n\nKohli's current stint with Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the IPL 2024 further solidifies his prowess. As the leading run-scorer in the tournament, with a staggering 708 runs under his belt from 14 innings, Kohli's dominance is undeniable. Despite facing criticism for his strike rate, Kohli's adaptability shines through, boasting his best IPL strike rate yet at 155.60.\n\nReflecting on Kohli's pivotal role in crucial matches, Ponting referenced his match-winning 82 against Pakistan in the 2022 T20 World Cup. Kohli's ability to deliver under pressure underscores his value to the Indian team, particularly in high-stakes encounters.\n\n\"I remember having this chat and some other chats I did for the ICC about there's some talk about Virat not being in their team only last year, but what happened when the big games come around, he was one of the guys who got the job done,\" Ponting said.\n\nWhile Kohli has predominantly batted at number three for India, Ponting predicted a potential shift to opening alongside Rohit Sharma. However, the emergence of young talent like Yashasvi Jaiswal presents a conundrum for the selectors. Despite the evolving T20 landscape favoring high strike rates over lengthy innings, Ponting believes Kohli's adaptability and experience make him an invaluable asset.\n\n\"They (selectors) have still got a decision to make (on the opening pair) because (Yashasvi) Jaiswal is in that squad and one thing they haven't got a lot in their team is left-hand batters,\" Ponting said.\n\nAlso Read: Reports: Virat Kohli's security threats force RCB to cancel practice session, four suspects arrested at Ahmedabad airport\n\n\"So they've got a decision to make with Jaiswal (batting position), but I'm pretty sure that they'll go with Kohli and Rohit Sharma (as openers). He can play his role at the top. And if you've got the right guys around him scoring (like) Suryakumar (Yadav)... Rohit Sharma's going to have a high strike rate. These other guys can go in there and play their way,\" he added.\n\n\"The mantra I think for the teams three or four years ago, was making sure that someone at the top of the order made 80 or 100, even if it took them 60 balls, it didn't really matter,\" Ponting said.\n\n\"I think it's sort of shifting now to be more of a strike rate based game where you can have a massive impact on a game with a 40 off 15 balls rather than getting an 80 off 55 balls sort of thing,\" he added.\n\nAs teams recalibrate their strategies to align with the evolving demands of T20 cricket, Kohli's prowess remains a constant. With Ponting's resounding endorsement, the debate surrounding Kohli's T20 credentials may finally be put to rest.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ponting", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Ponting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1716384147150_Virat-Kohli-and-Ricky-ponting.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588910", "eventUri": "eng-9588910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The dashing right-hander has already amassed 700+ runs as an opener and played a huge role in taking the RCB to the IPL 2024 Playoffs from the brink of elimination.\n\nThe former India and RCB skipper is currently the leading run scorer in the ongoing IPL 2024, and he would love to continue his awesome form in the upcoming T20 World Cup 2024, which would be perhaps his last chance to win the most coveted title in the format. This mega event will kick off on June 1 in the USA and Caribbean.\n\nIndia's batting superstar has a great record in the T20 World Cups, as he is the leading run-scorer in the tournament with 1141 runs in five editions. He was the highest run-getter in the 2014 T20 World Cup with 319 runs in six matches -- the highest by any batter in a single edition of the men's ICC event.\n\nMeanwhile, the former Australia captain backed Kohli's selection in India's squad for the upcoming T20 World Cup 2024, where the Men in Blue will kick off their campaign against Ireland on June 5 in New York. Ponting highlighted that Kohli is often subjected to unnecessary scrutiny and doubts about his capabilities in the T20 format, and he stressed that he would always be his first pick for Team India.\n\nThe Aussie legend emphasized Kohli's ability to play a crucial role at the top of the batting order for the Indian cricket team at the global event. He mentioned that Indian stars like Suryakumar Yadav and Rohit Sharma can maintain high strike rates, which will enable Kohli to effectively anchor the innings for India at the T20 World Cup in 2024.\n\nHe said that Kohli adds value and versatility to India's T20 setup. The Delhi Capitals (DC) head coach also insisted that there is no other player like Kohli who can play like him, saying he has that clash and experience that nobody can replace him.\n\nRicky Ponting was quoted as saying by ICC Review: \"It's funny with Virat. I think people in India just always try to find a reason not to pick him or a reason why he's maybe not as good as some of these other guys in the T20 game.

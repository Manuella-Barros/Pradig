Mounties suspected Tiki Laverdiere was dead before her burned, bludgeoned body was found wrapped in a carpet under rocks in a Saskatchewan pond in the summer of 2019. She was a 25-year-old mother of two. Her death launched five years of investigation and prosecutions, revealing a story of suspicion, drugs, booze and revenge, climaxing in one long night of torture. Ten people were eventually convicted, with the final cases recently wrapped in court, freeing up documents that had been under a publication ban. The savagery of the crime helped clear the path for investigators, said Supt. Joshua Graham, head of the Saskatchewan RCMP major crimes unit. \u201cWhen you have something like this, something so brutal, people became very self-interested as they were looking at life in jail and very serious ramifications,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI think that\u2019s just the brutal nature of this \u2026 people were a little more forthcoming with what they knew.\u201d North Battleford is a city of nearly 14,000 in northwest Saskatchewan, not far from the Alberta boundary. It was where Laverdiere spent her last days in April 2019. Court documents reveal how the killing was shaped by events three weeks earlier, in or around Edmonton, when Laverdiere\u2019s friend Tristen Cook-Buckle was killed. His family was told he was beaten, stabbed and shot in the head before his body and the vehicle he was in were set on fire. The death was devastating for his mother, Nicole Cook. Together, she and Laverdiere travelled from Edmonton to Thunderchild First Nation near North Battleford for the funeral. By then suspicions were forming. What did Laverdiere know? Did she have something to do with killing Cook-Buckle? The documents say one person who wanted answers was Soaring Eagle Whitstone, a relative who was also the head \u2013 formal title, \u201cQueen\u201d \u2013 of a street gang. Whitstone considered Cook-Buckle one of her grandchildren. Whitstone told his mother that Laverdiere was involved in the killing and had \u201cmessed with the wrong family,\u201d say the documents. Three nights later, at the home of one of Cook\u2019s relatives in North Battleford, after days of drinking and drug use, Whitstone took action. The documents detail what happened, and what witnesses heard. \u201cAll right my soldiers,\u201d Whitstone said, and gang members moved in, punching Laverdiere so hard in the face her nose split. As the blows came down, Cook yelled that Laverdiere knew more than she was telling. The group left the home and went to Whitstone\u2019s place, marching their bloodied, shoeless victim with them. \u201cHostage in the house!\u201d Whitstone yelled as they hauled Laverdiere inside, tied her to a chair and continued to beat her. Laverdiere was ordered to write down what she knew about Cook-Buckle\u2019s death. The note was never found. The documents say the beating continued until neighbours complained about the noise. Laverdiere was then taken to a third and final house, hustled down to the basement, tied, gagged and beaten with fists and a metal pipe for hours. Cook jumped up and down on her torso. The music was cranked up to drown out her cries and screams. A flammable substance was poured onto Laverdiere\u2019s head and lit ablaze. \u201cMy son burned,\u201d Cook told Laverdiere. \u201cNow you can burn.\u201d \u201cIt burns,\u201d Laverdiere cried. \u201cPlease put it out.\u201d The fire was extinguished. Smoke and a foul odour filled the basement. Whitstone said Laverdiere sounded like a \u201cdying dog,\u201d say the documents. She then told others to finish Laverdiere. A knife was held out, and someone in the group cut Laverdiere\u2019s neck. Her body was wrapped in carpet and plastic, put it in the back of a stolen truck, under a pile of garbage, and driven to the pond. Before leaving, one gang member levelled a sawed-off rifle at Laverdiere\u2019s head and fired \u2014 echoing Cook-Buckle\u2019s final moment. When the group returned, Whitstone congratulated them on a job well done. After two weeks, Laverdiere\u2019s mother reported her missing. Police grew suspicious when Cook went on social media to help look for Laverdiere. Cook posted a picture of them together, arm in arm. In the photo, Laverdiere is wearing a black sweatshirt. A month later, on July 11, 2019, Laverdiere\u2019s body was found in the pond, wearing the same black sweatshirt. Police needed dental records to identify her. Her ribs were smashed. There were puncture wounds, a wire twisted around her forearms, packing tape around her lower legs. Her hair and scalp were burned. A necklace with a heart-shaped pendant was stuck to her head. The documents say Laverdiere had purchased the pendant to go with a matching one she gave Cook at the funeral. Cook eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was given a life sentence with no possibility of parole for 10 years. Whitstone was convicted of first-degree murder and automatically sentenced to life in prison with no parole eligibility for 25 years. There were other convictions for gang members involved to varying degrees. Laverdiere\u2019s family have said they will never have true closure. \u201cHer two sons will never again get to feel the embrace of their mother\u2019s arms around them. She won\u2019t be there for them when they need her most,\u201d the family said in a statement provided through the RCMP. \u201cThey will never hear her tell them how much she loves them.\u201d Cook-Buckle\u2019s killing has not been solved. Graham said Mounties believe Laverdiere had no new information about his death, and they won\u2019t ever know what she wrote in that note as she was being tortured. \u201cBased on what people had told us during interviews, there was no confession or new information that related to who killed him,\u201d Graham said. Drugs, the officer said, were a theme through the tragedy. \u201cI think it\u2019s a combination of drugs, those suspicions and just the violent nature of the people (involved),\u201d he said. \u201cThis really was a crime of vengeance.\u201d This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 25, 2024.", "summary": "Mounties suspected Tiki Laverdiere was dead before her burned, bludgeoned body was found wrapped in a carpet under rocks in a Saskatchewan pond in the summer of 2019.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10524488/witnesses-helped-solve-brutal-saskatchewan-killing/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/20231012181048-652878279377bc11c8a9eee5jpeg-1.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:51:42", "author": "The Canadian Press", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.343}

The study highlights the importance of designing telehealth platforms and processes that better serve people who face day-to-day language barriers.\n\nThe study, published in JAMA Network Open, analyzed results of the 2021 California Health Interview Survey of 24,453 patients, 9% of whom identified as having limited English proficiency. The survey was conducted in six languages.\n\nPeople with limited English proficiency were about 40% more likely than those proficient in English to rate video health care visits as worse than in-person health care appointments. They were 20% more likely to describe their experiences with healthcare phone visits as worse than in-person visits, though this finding was not statistically significant.\n\n\"Setting up a video visit can require high-speed internet and a device.

The Brigham study found this as well; 37% of patients with limited English proficiency reported having used telehealth services, compared to 50% of the patients who identified as being proficient in the English language.\n\nWhat is unique about the JAMA Network Open analysis is that it revealed that even when people with limited English proficiency do gain access to virtual care, their experiences are, generally, worse than the experiences of those who don't face language barriers.\n\nRodriguez said survey respondents may have rated their experiences with phone visits as better than with video visits because phone calls are less challenging to set up than video calls. Plus, clinical teams may find it easier to call into an interpreting service than it is to add an interpreter to a video call.\n\nBeyond causing frustration, having a poor experience with a telehealth visit could affect health outcomes. For example, someone who has a poor experience with a video visit may be more reluctant to book healthcare appointments in the future. \"The findings have implications from a patient satisfaction and patient engagement standpoint that could have implications for health care access and uptake of technology in general,\" explained Rodriguez.\n\nTo bridge the gap between marginalized patients' experiences of telehealth versus in-person care, Rodriguez recommended national efforts to expand internet, computer, and smart phone access, video platforms that are simple to navigate in any language, and systems that facilitate a seamless access to interpreters. Rodriguez added that a more immediate solution is multilingual digital navigators who can, over the phone or in person, help patients register for video platforms, respond to technical problems, and more.\n\nMass General Brigham has implemented a Digital Access Coordinator program, which is part of the United Against Racism initiative.

The study highlights the importance of designing telehealth platforms and processes that better serve people who face day-to-day language barriers.\n\nThe study, published in JAMA Network Open, analyzed results of the 2021 California Health Interview Survey of 24,453 patients, 9% of whom identified as having limited English proficiency. The survey was conducted in six languages.\n\nPeople with limited English proficiency were about 40% more likely than those proficient in English to rate video health care visits as worse than in-person health care appointments. They were 20% more likely to describe their experiences with health care phone visits as worse than in-person visits, though this finding was not statistically significant.\n\n\"Setting up a video visit can require high-speed internet and a device. It may require creating a login for a new platform. If you're someone with limited English proficiency, you might need an interpreter to be involved. There are a lot of different pieces to navigate,\" said lead author Jorge Rodriguez, MD, a clinician-investigator in the Brigham's Division of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care.\n\n\"If you're a patient who doesn't speak the language that the technology is built in, just getting onto the platform is challenging.\"\n\nPreviously published studies have shown that marginalized groups are less likely to have access to virtual care to begin with. The Brigham study found this as well; 37% of patients with limited English proficiency reported having used telehealth services, compared to 50% of the patients who identified as being proficient in the English language.\n\nWhat is unique about the JAMA Network Open analysis is that it revealed that even when people with limited English proficiency do gain access to virtual care, their experiences are, generally, worse than the experiences of those who don't face language barriers.\n\nRodriguez said survey respondents may have rated their experiences with phone visits as better than with video visits because phone calls are less challenging to set up than video calls. Plus, clinical teams may find it easier to call into an interpreting service than it is to add an interpreter to a video call.\n\nBeyond causing frustration, having a poor experience with a telehealth visit could affect health outcomes. For example, someone who has a poor experience with a video visit may be more reluctant to book health care appointments in the future. \"The findings have implications from a patient satisfaction and patient engagement standpoint that could have implications for health care access and uptake of technology in general,\" explained Rodriguez.\n\nTo bridge the gap between marginalized patients' experiences of telehealth versus in-person care, Rodriguez recommended national efforts to expand internet, computer, and smart phone access, video platforms that are simple to navigate in any language, and systems that facilitate a seamless access to interpreters. Rodriguez added that a more immediate solution is multilingual digital navigators who can, over the phone or in person, help patients register for video platforms, respond to technical problems, and more.\n\nMass General Brigham has implemented a Digital Access Coordinator program, which is part of the United Against Racism initiative. The DAC program helps patients navigate Patient Gateway, telehealth and other digital tools. Its digital team has also made it possible for clinicians to add a virtual interpreter into an Epic integrated virtual visit.", "source": {"uri": "medicalxpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medical Xpress - Medical and Health News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_English_proficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Limited English proficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "JAMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_barrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language barrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_and_Women's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brigham and Women's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language interpretation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statistical significance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_General_Brigham", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass General Brigham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingualism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multilingualism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Communication_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Communication Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2023/telehealth.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553884", "eventUri": "eng-9553884", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

There was no difference observed in visit experiences between the two groups for telephone visits (29 versus 31 percent).\n\n\"These findings highlight access to telephone visits alongside needed improvements to video visits for patients with limited English proficiency,\" the authors write. \"Future work may evaluate the potential of digital navigators in improving the video visit experience.\"\n\nOne author disclosed ties to Valera Health, Clew, MDClone, FeelBetter, and AESOP Technology.", "source": {"uri": "healthday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "healthday.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lori_solomon@healthday.com", "name": "Lori Solomon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_English_proficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Limited English proficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telehealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telehealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JAMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_and_Women's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brigham and Women's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Navigator"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/healthday-en%2F2024-05%2F454c3f74-949e-47bc-9e17-b5133f8f75c2%2Forigin.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C800%2C420&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553884", "eventUri": "eng-9553884", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 219, "textEnd": 224}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

While research has focused on access, attention to patient experience is essential. Patients with LEP have worse experience with in-person care. We examined differences in telehealth access and experience between patients with LEP and patients with English proficiency (EP) in California.\n\nWe analyzed the 2021 adult data from California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), which is conducted in 6 languages. The Brigham and Women's Hospital Institutional Review Board deemed this cross-sectional study exempt from review and waived informed consent because publicly available data were used. We followed the STROBE reporting guideline.\n\nStudy exposure was LEP, defined as speaking English not well or not at all. Study outcomes were telehealth use and visit experience. For telehealth use, CHIS participants were asked whether they had used video or telephone telehealth in the past 12 months (eAppendix in Supplement 1). For visit experience, participants were asked to compare their experience with video or telephone visits to in-person visits. We dichotomized visit experience to better or same vs worse. Outcomes of patients with LEP or EP were assessed and compared. Covariates included factors associated with use of digital tools: age, sex, marital status, insurance status, educational level, poverty level, health status, internet use, and having usual source of care. Self-reported race and ethnicity and metropolitan area residency were excluded due to collinearity.\n\nWe performed bivariable comparisons using weighted \u03c7 analysis. We then performed weighted multivariable logistic regression to ascertain odds of worse experience after controlling for covariates. We used survey-supplied replicate weights to produce population estimates, as recommended by CHIS. Weights represent California's residential population.\n\nTwo-sided P\u2009<\u2009.05 was considered significant. Analyses were performed using R 3.6.2 (R Core Team).\n\nThe study included 24\u202f453 participants (10 735 males [weighted 49%], 13 718 females [weighted 51%]), representing a population of 29\u202f649\u202f837. Patients with LEP accounted for 9% of participants and 7% of telehealth users. Telehealth users with LEP differed significantly from users with EP across most covariates (Table 1). Among telehealth users, patients with LEP accounted for 6.8% of video visit users (387, representing a population of 840\u202f764) and 8.1% telephone visit users (484, representing a population of 1\u202f021\u202f909).\n\nIn unadjusted analyses, patients with LEP were less likely to report either video or telephone telehealth use (37% vs 50%; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In adjusted analyses, patients with LEP were less likely to report video or telephone telehealth use (odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52-0.77; P\u2009<\u2009.001) vs patients with EP (Table 2). For video visits, in unadjusted analyses, patients with LEP reported worse experience (32% vs 26%; P\u2009=\u2009.04) vs patients with EP. In adjusted analyses, patients with LEP were more likely to report worse experience with video visits than in-person visits (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04-1.94; P\u2009=\u2009.03). For telephone visits, there was no difference in visit experience between the 2 groups (unadjusted: 29% vs 31%, P\u2009=\u2009.60; adjusted: OR, 1.24 [95% CI, 0.91-1.69], P\u2009=\u2009.17).\n\nFor patients with LEP, we found not only telehealth access disparities but also worse video visit experience. Additionally, characteristics of video and telephone visit users differed by English proficiency. Worse video visit experience may be associated with challenges in integrating interpreters into telehealth visits or perceived effectiveness by both clinicians and patients. Patients, especially those with LEP, prefer in-person care due to anxiety with self-evaluation without a medical professional. Digital barriers (eg, lack of affordable broadband/devices, unavailable translated portals, and limited digital literacy and support) may also play a role.\n\nStudy limitations include reliance on self-reported telehealth use, focus on California, and inability to control for clinician factors that may affect care experience. Future work may evaluate the potential of digital navigators in improving the video visit experience. These findings highlight access to telephone visits alongside needed improvements to video visits for patients with LEP.\n\nCorresponding Author: Jorge A.
